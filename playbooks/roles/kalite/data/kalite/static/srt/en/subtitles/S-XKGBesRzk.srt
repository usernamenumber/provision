1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's see if we can learn a
thing or two about partial

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,210
fraction expansion, or
sometimes it's called partial

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,560
fraction decomposition.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,390
   

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,800
The whole idea is to take
rational functions-- and a

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,980
rational function is just a
function or expression where

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,170
it's one expression divided by
another-- and to essentially

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,560
expand them or decompose
them into simpler parts.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,020
And the first thing you've got
to do, before you can even

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,850
start the actual partial
fraction expansion process, is

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,760
to make sure that the
numerator has a lower degree

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,650
than the denominator.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,440
In the situation, the problem,
that I've drawn right here,

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,560
I've written right here,
that's not the case.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,190
The numerator has the same
degree as the denominator.

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,430
So the first step we want to do
to simplify this and to get it

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,850
to the point where the
numerator has a lower degree

19
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,780
than the denominator is
to do a little bit of

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,270
algebraic division.

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,320
And I've done a video on this,
but it never hurts to get a

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,530
review here, so to do that, we
divide the denominator into the

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,810
numerator to figure out the
remainder, so we divide x

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:18,590
squared minus 3x minus 40 into
x squared minus 2x minus 37.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,010
So how many times?

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,620
You look at the highest degree
term, so x squared goes into x

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,380
squared one time, one times
this whole thing is x squared

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,690
minus 3x minus 40, and now you
want to subtract this from

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,470
that to get the remainder.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,010
And see, if I'm subtracting, so
I'm going to subtract, and then

31
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,410
minus minus is a plus, a plus,
and then you can add them.

32
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,540
These cancel out.

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,320
Minus 2x plus 3x, that's x.

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,680
Minus 37 plus 40,
that's plus 3.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,410
So this expression up here can
be rewritten as-- let me scroll

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:05,680
down a little bit-- as 1 plus x
plus 3 over x squared

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,690
minus 3x minus 40.

38
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,250
This might seem like some type
of magic thing I just did, but

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,380
this is no different than what
you did in the fourth or fifth

40
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,930
grade, where you learned how
to convert improper regular

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,620
fractions into mixed numbers.

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,180
Let me just do a little
side example here.

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,520
If I had 13 over 2, and I want
to turn it into a mixed number,

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,910
what you do-- you can probably
do this in your head now-- but

45
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,360
what you did is, you divide the
denominator into the numerator,

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,810
just like we did over here.

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,755
2 goes into 13.

48
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,490
We see 2 goes into 13 six
times, 6 times 2 is 12, you

49
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,050
subtract that from that,
you get a remainder of 1.

50
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,870
2 doesn't go into 1, so
that's just the remainder.

51
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,310
So if you wanted to rewrite
this, it would be the number of

52
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,820
times the denominator goes into
the numerator, that's 6, plus

53
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,160
the remainder over
the denominator.

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,560
Plus 6-- plus 1 over 2.

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,110
And when you did it in
elementary school, you would

56
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,130
just write 6 1/2, but 6 1/2 is
the same thing as 6 plus 1/2.

57
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,480
That's exactly the same
thing we did here.

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,710
The denominator went to the
numerator one time, and then

59
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,245
there was a remainder of x plus
3 left over, so it's 1 plus x

60
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:14,590
plus 3 over this expression.

61
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:22,260
Now we see that that numerator
in this rational expression

62
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,760
does have a lower degree
than the denominator.

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,530
The highest degree here is 1,
the highest degree here is 2,

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,470
so we're ready to commence our
partial fraction decomposition.

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,420
And all that is, is taking this
expression up here and turning

66
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,290
it into two simpler expressions
where the denominators are the

67
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,310
factors of this lower term.

68
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,570
So given that, let's
factor this lower term.

69
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,510
So let's see.

70
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,650
What two numbers add up to
minus 3, and when you multiply

71
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,050
them, you get minus 40?

72
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,380
So let's see.

73
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,810
They have to be different
signs, because when you

74
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,280
multiply them you get a
negative, so it has to

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,700
be minus 8 and plus 5.

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,810
So we can rewrite this up here
as-- I'll switch colors--

77
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:17,990
1 plus x plus 3 over x
plus 5 times x minus 8.

78
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,770
5 times 8 is minus 40-- 5 times
negative 8 is minus 40, plus 5

79
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,170
minus 8 is minus 3,
so we're all set.

80
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,110
Now I'll just focus on
this part right now.

81
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,530
We can just remember
that that 1 is sitting

82
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,700
out there out front.

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,110
This is the expression we
want to decompose or expand.

84
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,010
And we're going to expand it
into two simpler expressions

85
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,810
where each of these are the
denominator-- and I will make

86
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,010
the claim, and if the numbers
work out then the claim is

87
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,600
true-- I'll make the claim that
I can expand this, or decompose

88
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,560
this, into two fractions where
the first fraction is just some

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,500
number a over the first factor,
over x plus 5, plus some

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,890
number b over the second
factor, over x minus 8.

91
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,200
That's my claim, and if I can
solve for a and b in a way that

92
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,530
it actually does add up to
this, then I'm done and I will

93
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,250
have fully decomposed
this fraction.

94
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,960
I guess is the way-- I
don't know if that's the

95
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,850
correct terminology.

96
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,750
So let's try to do that.

97
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,530
So if I were to add these
two terms, what do I get?

98
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,320
When you add anything, you find
the common denominator, and the

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,640
common denominator, the easiest
common denominator, is to

100
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,220
multiply the two denominators,
so let me write this here.

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:39,570
So a over x plus 5 plus b
over x minus 8 is equal to--

102
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,230
well, let's get the common
denominator-- it's equal to

103
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,580
x plus 5 times x minus 8.

104
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,080
And then the a term, we would--
a over x plus 5 is the same

105
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,010
thing as a times x minus
8 over this whole thing.

106
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,030
I mean, if I just wrote this
right here, you would just

107
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,720
cancel these two terms out and
you would get a over x plus 5.

108
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,010
And then you could add that to
the common denominator, x plus

109
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:19,450
5 times x minus 8, and it
would be b times x plus 5.

110
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,110
Important to realize,
that, look.

111
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,690
This term is the exact same
thing as this term if you just

112
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,330
cancel the x minus 8 out, and
this term is the exact same

113
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,320
thing as this term if you just
cancel the x plus 5 out.

114
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,800
But now that we have an actual
common denominator, we can add

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,820
them together, so we get-- let
me just write the left side

116
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,000
here over-- a over x
plus 5-- I'm sorry.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,230
I want to write this over here.

118
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:54,550
I want to write x plus 3 over
plus 5 times x minus 8 is equal

119
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,710
to is equal to the sum of
these two things on top.

120
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:07,440
a times x minus 8 plus b times
x plus 5, all of that over

121
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,830
their common denominator, x
plus 5 times x minus eight.

122
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,600
So the denominators are the
same, so we know that this,

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,990
when you add this together,
you have to get this.

124
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,600
So if we want to solve
for a and b, let's just

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,370
set that equality.

126
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,000
We can ignore the denominators.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,110
So we can say that x plus 3
is equal to a times x minus

128
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,430
8 plus b times x plus 5.

129
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,550
Now, there's two ways to
solve for a and b from

130
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,950
this point going forward.

131
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,950
One is the way that I was
actually taught in the seventh

132
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,150
or eighth grade, which tends to
take a little longer, then

133
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,340
there's a fast way to do it and
it never hurts to do

134
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,890
the fast way first.

135
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,290
If you want to solve for a,
let's pick an x that'll

136
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,940
make this term disappear.

137
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,000
So what x would make
this term disappear?

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,190
Well, if I say x is minus 5,
then this becomes 0, and

139
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,760
then the b disappears.

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,660
So if we say x is minus 5-- I'm
just picking an arbitrary x to

141
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,610
be able to solve for this--
then this would become minus 5

142
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,070
plus 3-- let me just write it
out, minus 5 plus 3-- is equal

143
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,520
to a times minus 5 minus 8--
let me just write it out,

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,750
minus 5 minus 8-- plus
b times minus 5 plus 5.

145
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,610
And I picked the minus 5 to
make this expression 0.

146
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,090
So then you get-- pick a
brighter color-- minus 5 plus

147
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:44,230
3 is minus 2, is equal to--
what is this?-- minus 13a

148
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,990
plus-- this is 0, right?

149
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,690
That's 0.

150
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,130
Minus 5 plus 5 is 0, 0 times b
is 0, and then you divide both

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,600
sides by minus 13, you get--
negatives cancel out-- you get

152
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,940
2 over 13 is equal to a, and
now we can do the same thing up

153
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,270
here and get rid of the a terms
by making x is equal to 8.

154
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:11,150
If x is equal to 8, you get x
plus 3 is equal to 11, is equal

155
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:19,660
to a times 0 plus b times--
what's 5-- 8 plus 5

156
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,340
is-- plus b times 13.

157
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,880
Their b looks a bit like a 13.

158
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,430
And then you get 11 is equal to
13b, divide both sides by 13,

159
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,130
you get b is equal
to 11 over 13.

160
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,300
So we were able to solve
for our a's and our b's.

161
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,370
And so we can go back to
our original equation

162
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,060
and we could say, wow.

163
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,960
This just has to be equal to
2 over 13, and this just has

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,765
to be equal to 11 over 13.

165
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:52,310
   

166
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,080
So our original, our very
original thing we wrote up

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,750
here, can be decomposed into 1,
that's this 1 over here, plus

168
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,150
this, which is 2 over 13-- I'll
just write it like this for

169
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,850
now-- 2 over 13, over x plus 5.

170
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,735
You could bring the 13 down
here if you want to write

171
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,970
it so you don't have a
fraction over a fraction.

172
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:27,115
Plus 11 over 13 times--
over x minus 8.

173
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,190
And once again, you could bring
the 13 down so you don't have

174
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,400
a fraction over a fraction.

175
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,075
But we have just successfully
decomposed this pretty-- I

176
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,600
don't want to say that we
necessarily simplified it,

177
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,320
because you could say, oh, we
only have one expression here,

178
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,690
now I have three-- but I've
reduced the degree of both the

179
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,660
numerators and the
denominators.

180
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,420
And you might say, well,
Sal, why would I ever

181
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,250
have to do this?

182
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,140
And you're right.

183
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,680
In algebra you probably won't.

184
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,800
But this is actually a really
useful technique later on when

185
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,560
you get to calculus, and
actually, differential

186
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,160
equations, because a lot of
times it's much easier-- and

187
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll throw out a word here that
you don't understand-- to take

188
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,000
the integral or the
antiderivative of

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,550
something like this, then
something like this.

190
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,930
And later, when you do inverse
Laplace transforms and

191
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,600
differential equations, it's
much easier take an inverse

192
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,920
Laplace transform of
something like this than

193
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,070
something like that.

194
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,120
So anyway, hopefully I've given
you another tool kit in your--

195
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,950
or another tool in your tool
kit, and I'll probably do a

196
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,750
couple more videos because we
haven't exhausted all of the

197
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,800
examples that we could we
could show for partial

198
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,770
fraction decomposition.

199
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,308
