1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,120
We're told that the glass
portion of the window shown

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,720
below-- that's the window--
has a height to width the

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,660
ratio of 3:2.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,450
So the height of the glass
portion can be represented as

6
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:21,250
3x and the width of the
glass portion can be

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,500
represented as 2x.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,340
   

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,890
The wood trim adds 7 inches to
the total width and 8 inches

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,540
to the total height.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,670
So let me write that down.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,450
So 8 in height, we're
doing it in yellow.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,650
So 8 inches to the total height,
I'll do it in yellow,

14
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,330
and 7 inches to the total
width, I'll do in this

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,680
purplish color, right?

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,670
We're doing the width
in purple.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,050
Now what they say is write a
polynomial expression that

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,350
represents the total area of
the window, including the

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,450
glass and wood.

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,750
Simplify the expression.

21
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,480
Now, the way they've described
it, they're telling us the

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,460
ratio of 3:2 for the
glass portion.

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,500
I think when they're talking
about the glass portion,

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,610
they're talking about this
entire portion right here.

25
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,130
   

26
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,370
Even though it's not all glass,
you have that thing in

27
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,010
the middle, you have this
divider right over here,

28
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,450
that's not glass, but I think
they're including that as the

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,160
glass portion, because they're
not giving us any

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,460
measurements for that.

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,125
So the height of the glass
portion can be

32
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,830
represented as 3x.

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,050
So this height right here of
just the glass portion is 3x.

34
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,920
You can't see that.

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,360
Let me do it in a
better color.

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,510
This portion right here is 3x,
just this distance right here.

37
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,290
That is the height of
the glass portion.

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,610
And then they tell us the wood
trim adds 8 inches to the

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,650
total height.

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:51,670
So if you take that 3x and then
you add that plus that,

41
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,600
this whole distance over here,
which is the glass portion

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,740
plus the wood trim on either
end, it adds 8 inches to the

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,310
glass portion.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,990
The glass portion is 3x, so
we're going to add 8 to it.

45
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,990
So this height right
here 3x plus 8.

46
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,090
And now let's think
about the width.

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,090
The width of the glass portion
can be represented as 2x, so

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,020
that distance right there, just
the glass portion, is 2x.

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,255
But then they say when you add
the wood trim, the wood trim

50
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:23,550
adds 7 inches to the total
width, so this total width

51
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,770
right here, because we're adding
that piece and that

52
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,050
piece to it, is 2x plus 7.

53
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,130
   

54
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,860
That is the total width of
the window, the total

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,670
height is 3x plus 8.

56
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,460
Now, what they want us to
do is write a polynomial

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,900
expression that represents the
total area of the window

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,510
including the glass and wood.

59
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,230
Simplify the expression.

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,890
Now, the total area is
just going to be the

61
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,630
height times the width.

62
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,950
So let's just write that down.

63
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,360
The area is just going to be
equal to the height, which is

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,996
3x plus 8 times the width,
times 2x plus 7.

65
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:03,270
   

66
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,700
And that is the expression
we've written up.

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,680
Well, we haven't done
it as a polynomial.

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,300
We've written it as a product
of two binomials.

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,580
And if we want to simplify it,
we can just multiply it out.

70
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,560
So the way you can think about
it is we multiply-- you're

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,760
doing the distributive property
twice essentially.

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,150
But you could say let's multiply
3x times 2x, so you

73
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,680
get 3x times 2x.

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,390
   

75
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,160
That's multiplying
it times that.

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,600
Then you want to multiply 3x
times 7, which is 21x-- let me

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,260
just write it this way--
plus 3x times 7.

78
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,740
And then you want to multiply
this 8 times both of these

79
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:50,320
terms. So then you have
plus 8 times 2x.

80
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,900
Let me do this.

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:59,185
So plus 8 times 2x and then
you have plus 8 times 7.

82
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:05,880
   

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,610
And now we just have to
simplify everything.

84
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,130
So what does this become?

85
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,920
3x times 2x is 6x squared plus
3x times 7 is plus 21x plus 8

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,700
times 2x, so plus 16x, and then
plus 8 times 7, 8 times 7

87
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,340
is 56, plus 56.

88
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,370
We can combine these
two middle terms.

89
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,650
21x plus 16x is what?

90
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,120
37x.

91
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,940
So then we get-- let me just
do it in another color-- 6x

92
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,870
squared plus 37x plus 56.

93
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,260
Now we've expressed it as
a simplified polynomial

94
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,510
expression.

95
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,866
