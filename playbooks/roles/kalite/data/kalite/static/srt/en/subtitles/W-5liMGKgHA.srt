1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:08,040
Let's say that Arman today is 18 years old

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,787
And let's say that Diya today, is 2 years old

3
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:21,430
And what I am curious about in this video, is how many years will it take

4
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,519
And let me write this down

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:46,426
How many years, will it take for Arman to be 3 times as old as Diya?

6
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:48,454
So that's the question right there

7
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:54,170
And I encourage you to try to take a shot at this yourself

8
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,946
So let's think about this a little bit

9
00:00:55,946 --> 00:01:00,378
We're asking how many years it will take, that's what we don't know, that's what we're curious about

10
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:05,947
How many years will it take for Arman to be 3 times as old as Diya?

11
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:10,784
So let's set some variable, let's say y will be years

12
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:17,697
Let's say y is equal to years it will take

13
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:21,643
So given that, can we now set up an equation given this information

14
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:28,684
To figure out how many years it will take for Arman to be 3 times as old as Diya?

15
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:35,215
Well, let's think about how old Arman will be in y years

16
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:49,191
Well in y years, Arman is going to be how old?

17
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:52,361
Arman is going to be, well he's 18 right now

18
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,401
And in y years, he is going to be y years older

19
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:59,309
So, in y years Arman is going to be 18 plus y

20
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:02,748
And what about Diya? How old will she be?

21
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,504
How old will she be in y years?

22
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:12,356
Well, she's 2 now and in y years she'll just be 2 plus y

23
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:14,957
So what we're curious about now that we know this

24
00:02:14,957 --> 00:02:23,278
Is how many years will it take for this quantity, for this expression, to be 3 times this quantity

25
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:24,673
So we're really curious

26
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:38,177
We wanna solve for y, such that 18 plus y is going to be equal to 3 times, 2 plus y

27
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:42,612
Notice, this is Arman in y years, this is Diya in y years

28
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:50,344
And we were saying that what Arman is going to be in y years is 3 times what Diya is going to be in y years

29
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,632
So we've set up our equation

30
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:56,296
Now we can just solve it, so let's take this step by step

31
00:02:56,296 --> 00:03:00,674
So on the left hand side, maybe I'll do this in a new colour just so I don't have to keep switching

32
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:03,409
So on the left hand side, I still have 18 plus y

33
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:08,328
And on the right hand side, I can just distribute this 3, so 3 times 2 is 6

34
00:03:08,328 --> 00:03:11,204
3 times y is 3y

35
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,628
6 plus 3y

36
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:18,008
And then it's always nice to get all of our constants on one side of the equation

37
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,094
All of our variables on the other side of the equation

38
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:24,736
So we have our "3y" over here we have more "y"s here on the right hand side than on the left hand side

39
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,671
So let's get rid of the y's on the left hand side

40
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,088
You can do it either way but you'd end up with negative numbers

41
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:33,101
So let's subtract a y, from each side

42
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,461
And we are left with

43
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,275
On the left hand side, 18

44
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,138
And on the right hand side, you have 6

45
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,836
Plus 3 y's take away one of those y's

46
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,365
You're gonna be left with 2 y's

47
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:50,411
Now, we can get rid of the constant term here

48
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:56,456
So, we will subtract 6 from both sides

49
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,186
18 minus 6 is 12

50
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:01,104
The whole reason why we subtracted 6 from the right was to get rid of this

51
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,881
6 minus 6 is 0, so you have 12 is equal to 2y

52
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,416
2 times the number of years it will take

53
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,297
Is 12, and you can probably solve this in your head

54
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:12,612
But if we just want a one coefficient here we divide by 2 on the right

55
00:04:12,612 --> 00:04:15,419
Whatever we do to one side of the equation we have to do it on the other side

56
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,315
Otherwise the equation will not still be an equation

57
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:25,115
So we are left with, y is equal to 6

58
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:27,940
or, y is equal to 6

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,106
So, going back to the question

60
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:34,125
How many years will it take for Arman to be 3 times as old as Diya?

61
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,540
Well, it's going to take 6 years

62
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,411
Now, I want you to verify this

63
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:43,763
Think about it, is this actually true?

64
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:46,777
Well, in 6 years how old is Arman going to be?

65
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:51,893
He's going to be 18 plus 6, we now know that this thing is 6

66
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:58,383
In 6 years, Arman is going to be 18 plus 6 which is 24 years old

67
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,344
How old is Diya going to be?

68
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:03,090
Well, she's going to be 2 plus 6,

69
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,358
which is, 2 plus 6 which is 8 years old

70
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:13,073
And lo and behold, 24 is indeed 3 times as old as 8.

71
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:18,496
In 6 years, Arman is 24 and Diya is 8, Arman is 3 times as old as Diya

72
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:21,000
And we are done!
