1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:04,491
It looks like this exercise is asking use to do many

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:08,176
things and i encourage you to pause this video and try to do it on your own

3
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:12,207
first and then see maybe how I tackle the same exact thing

4
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,741
so the first thing they're saying is Draw

5
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:17,024
a 60 degree angle in standard position together

6
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:21,773
with a unit circle.Use the triangle

7
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:25,526
below, so this triangle right over here, to find the x- and y- coordinates

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,624
of the point of intersection of the terminal side and

9
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:33,524
the circle.So let me draw a unit circle here

10
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:36,725
so that is my y-axis

11
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:41,408
and then this could be my x-axis

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:46,191
and then I'm gonna draw a unit circle, which is a circle of radius one

13
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:48,408
so I'm gonna do my best to draw

14
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:50,441
its obviously hard to freehand

15
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:54,692
draw a circle, but I have a little easier time when I draw it as

16
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,908
a dotted line, I can later make it undotted

17
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:02,192
okay!...so that's pretty close, my best attempt

18
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,891
at freehand drawing a unit circle

19
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:09,207
so there you go...filling the dots

20
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:12,441
now that i need it to be a solid line

21
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:16,474
so that's my best attempt...fair enough.so I've drawn

22
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:20,707
the unit circle..."Unit circle"

23
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:25,825
it has radius One, so this point right over here

24
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:28,427
is going to be the point (1,0)

25
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:31,359
the x-coordinate is 1 and the y-coordinate is 0

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,962
This point right over here, on the Y-coordinate.So thats the point (o,1)

27
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:42,825
and then this over here is the point (-1,0)

28
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:52,331
and this point right over here is a zero x-coordinate and a negative one y-coordinate (0,-1)

29
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:56,291
there you go.So those are those 3 points or those 4 points

30
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,142
right over there.So that is my unit circle

31
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:02,197
now they say draw a 60 degree angle in standard

32
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:06,508
position together with a unit circle. so standard position,

33
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:10,343
you start to draw a ray, its centered at the origin

34
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:14,680
its along the positive x-axis, that's your initial side of your angle

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,842
and then you...since we're going positive 60 degree, we'll go in a

36
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:22,410
counter clockwise direction, so we're going positive

37
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,243
60 degrees, counter clockwise direction and so your terminal side

38
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,592
would be a ray that looks something like that, so that's

39
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:33,059
our 60 degree angle in standard position

40
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:38,011
Use the triangle below, so that's this triangle to find the x- and y-coordinates

41
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,426
of the point of intersection of the terminal side and the circle.

42
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,960
so it sounds very complex but all they're saying is

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,826
what are the x- and y-coordinates of that point right over there

44
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:55,823
so what is the x-coordinate and what is the y-coordinate

45
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,097
and I'll give you a little bit of a hint here

46
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:03,862
we can drop...we can construct a right triangle by taking a line

47
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:07,709
from that point and going straight down, since it went straight down

48
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,376
we know that this is a 90 degree angle

49
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:15,694
we also know that if this is a 60 degree angle right over here

50
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:18,627
so this is a 60 degree angle ..and this is a 90 degree angle

51
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:22,760
we know that all the angles of a triangle have to add up to 180 degrees

52
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,494
so we know that this up here is going to be a 30 degree angle

53
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:33,293
so using that information..and this triangle right over here

54
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:37,343
and what we know about similar triangle, can we now figure out what x- and

55
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:42,260
y- are going to be.. well lets think about it

56
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,244
lets think about it a little bit

57
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,606
so what is...what is the x-coordinate of this

58
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:51,811
that's just the distance we have to go along the x-axis over here

59
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:55,559
this is the x and then we would go y up that much. so this distance right over here

60
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:59,945
essentially the bottom of this 30, 60 90 triangle

61
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:02,881
this is going to be..this length is going to be equal to

62
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:06,893
our x-coordinate.and then this height over here

63
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,344
the height of this triangle, the length of this side

64
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:12,360
that's going to be equal to our y-coordinate...

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:21,426
so if we just figure out the lengths of these sides, then we know what the x- and y-coordinates

66
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:24,508
are going to be, and we also know that these are similar triangles

67
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:27,511
you have a 60 degree angle here ...you have a 60 degree angle here

68
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:31,530
you have a 30 degree angle up here...you have a 30 degree angle up here.

69
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,861
you have a 90 degree angle over here...you have a 90 degree angle over here

70
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:42,027
so all the angles are the same, these are similar

71
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:45,611
triangles, which tell you the ratio of corresponding sides are going to be the same

72
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,865
well lets think about the ratios of the corresponding sides.

73
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:52,875
well what sides do we know on this triangle right over here, here they gave us all the sides

74
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,996
what sides do we know here?. well we knew that this was a unit circle

75
00:04:55,996 --> 00:05:01,511
so what is the distance between our origin and this intersection point

76
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:06,278
so what is the length ..essentially of the hypotenuse of this right triangle

77
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:09,645
well the hypotenuse is a radius

78
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:13,977
of the unit circle,a unit circle is a circle which has radius 1

79
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,812
so the hypotenuse here has the radius 1

80
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:20,347
and so hopefully we can now use this information and knowing that the ratio

81
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:24,478
of the corresponding sides are going to be to same, to come up with

82
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,597
what x- and y- are.

83
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:31,961
so, one thing we can say is that the ratio of the short side of this triangle

84
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,212
to the long side should be the same as the ratio of the short side of this triangle

85
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:39,395
to the long side, or the ratio of the side opposite the 30 degree angle

86
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:44,205
to the hypotenuse should be the same as the ratio of the side opposite to the 30 degree angle to the

87
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:49,710
hypotenuse.so we could say the ratio of 1 to 2

88
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,611
the ratio of 1 to 2 would be the same as the ratio of

89
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:57,960
x to 1 ..to the hypotenuse

90
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,629
or this could immediately get solved because x divided by 1 is just equal to x

91
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,510
or we get x is equal to one half (x = 1/2)

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,079
lets use that same logic again.

93
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,479
The ratio of this side opposite the 60 degree side to the hypotenuse

94
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,128
so square root of 3 to the hypotenuse

95
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:24,295
should be the same as the ratio of the side opposite the 60 degree angle

96
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,828
which in this case is y to this hypotenuse ...to 1

97
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:32,828
well once again this is essentially Y divided by 1 (y/1) is just Y

98
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:36,179
so we get y is equal to square root of 3 over 2 (y=√3/2)

99
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:41,062
so we now know the x- and y-coordinates, this we can rewrite

100
00:06:41,062 --> 00:06:49,796
as (1/2,√3/2)

101
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:52,595
now the last part they ask use to

102
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:57,597
confirm that the x-coordinate is equal to the cosine of 60 degree (cos60°)

103
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:02,279
let me do that in different color..confirm that the x-coordinate is equal to cos60°

104
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:10,829
well ..lets take out our SOH CAH TOA

105
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,980
again, just to remember what sine,cosine and tangent definitions are

106
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,412
SOH.... CAH

107
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,227
SOH CAH ...let me use a different color

108
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:22,146
SOH CAH TOA

109
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:26,179
So whats the Cosine of 60° going to be equal to?

110
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,229
So the cosine of this angle.

111
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:34,345
so the cosine of 60°(cos60°) is going to be equal to the adjacent over the hypotenuse(Adj/Hyp)

112
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:38,613
its going to be equal to x over the hypotenuse.

113
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:43,879
its going to be equal to x over the hypotenuse which is just 1, this is a unit circle

114
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,782
so x is going to be equal to the cosine of 60°(x=cos60°)

115
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:51,199
our x-coordinate is the same thing a cosine of 60°(cos60°)

116
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,196
and we already figured out that x is equal to one half (x=1/2)

117
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:58,214
so that all checks out. We can do the same thing for the sine.

118
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:01,962
We must make sure that the y-coordinate is equal to the sine of 60°(sin60°)

119
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:07,562
so sine of 60° ..based on our definition of these trig functions

120
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:13,997
is equal to the opposite over hypotenuse(Opp/Hyp)

121
00:08:13,997 --> 00:08:15,596
so its equal to the opposite ..is our y-coordinate

122
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,062
the length here is the same as our y-coordinate

123
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,579
so its equal to y over our hypotenuse..well that's definitely equal to y

124
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:25,870
which we already got with square to 3 over 2 which is equal to square root of 3 over 2

125
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,130
so that checks out

126
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,930
and that y over x is equal to tangent of sixty degrees

127
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,696
well tangent is opposite over adjacent (opp/adj)

128
00:08:34,696 --> 00:08:36,469
so let me right it over here ..running out of real estate

129
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,496
tangent of 60 degrees

130
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:45,263
TOA tells us its opposite over adjacent

131
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:50,197
the opposite side is y ..the adjacent side is x

132
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:54,000
so that also works out
