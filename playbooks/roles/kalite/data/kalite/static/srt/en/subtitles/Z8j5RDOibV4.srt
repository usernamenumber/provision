1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:02,179
We're asked to divide.

2
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:06,362
And we're dividing six plus three i by seven minus 5i.

3
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:10,200
And in particular, when I divide this, I want to get another complex number.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,023
So I want to get some real number plus some imaginary number,

5
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:16,600
so some multiple of i's.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,067
So let's think about how we can do this.

7
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,108
Well, division is the same thing --

8
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:26,271
and we rewrite this as six plus three i over seven minus five i.

9
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:27,971
These are clearly equivalent;

10
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:33,200
dividing by something is the same thing as a rational expression where that something is in the denominator,

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
right over here.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,532
And so how do we simplify this?

13
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:42,469
Well, we have a tool in our toolkit that can make sure that we don't have an imaginary or complex number in the denominator.

14
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:45,267
And that's the complex conjugate.

15
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:48,483
If we multiply both the numerator and the denominator of this expression

16
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:51,067
by the complex conjugate of the denominator,

17
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:55,933
then we will have a real number in the denominator.

18
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,067
So let's do that.

19
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,800
Let's multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of this.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,400
So seven PLUS five i. Seven plus five i is the complex conjegate of seven minus five i.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,067
So we're going to multiply it by seven plus five i over seven plus five i.

22
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:16,400
And anything divided by itself is going to be one

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
(assuming you're not dealing with zero; zero over zero is undefined).

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,152
But seven plus five i over seven plus five i is one.

25
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:24,800
So we're not changing the value of this.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,067
But what this does is it allows us to get rid of the imaginary part in the denominator.

27
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,333
So let's multiply this out.

28
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,578
Our numerator --

29
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:38,467
we just have to multiply every part of this complex number times every part of this complex number.

30
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:43,000
You can think of it as FOIL if you like; we're really just doing the distributive property twice.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,667
We have six times seven, which is forty two.

32
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:58,867
And then we have six times five i, which is thirty i. So plus thirty i.

33
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:09,710
And then we have three i times seven, so that's plus twenty-one i.

34
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:12,375
And then finally we have three i times five i.

35
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,351
Three times five is fifteen.

36
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:17,439
But we have i times i, or i squared, which is negative one.

37
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,369
So it would be fifteen times negative one, or minus 15.

38
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,159
So that's our numerator.

39
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,282
And then our denomenator is going to be --

40
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:33,067
Well, we have a plus b times a minus b. (You could think of it that way.

41
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:36,333
Or we could just do what we did up here. Actually, let's just do what we did up here

42
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:39,242
so you don't have to remember that difference of squares pattern and all that.)

43
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,000
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,667
Let's think of it in the FOIL way, if that is helpful for you.

45
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:52,153
So first we did the 7X7. And we can do the outer terms. 7 X 5i is +35i.

46
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:57,133
Then we can do the inner terms. -5i X 7 is -35i.

47
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,490
These two are going to cancel out.

48
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,250
And then -5i X 5i is -25i^2 ("negative twenty five i squared").

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,893
-25i^2 is the same thing as -25 times -1, so that is +25.

50
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,333
Now let's simplify it.

51
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,235
These guys down here cancel out.

52
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:19,831
Our denominator simplifies to 49 + 25 is 74.

53
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:23,000
And our numerator: we can add the real parts,

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,238
so we have a 42 and a -15.

55
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:32,933
Let's see: 42 - 5 would be 37, minus another 10 would be 27.

56
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,829
So that is 27.

57
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:42,494
And then we're going to add our 30i, plus the 21i --

58
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:50,210
so 30 of something plus another 21 of that same something is going to be 51 of that something,

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,148
in this case that something is the imaginary unit; it is i.

60
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,200
(We'll do this in magenta; o, I guess that's orange.)

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,652
So this is +51i.

62
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:05,467
And I want to write it in the form of "a+bi," the traditional complex number form.

63
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:12,006
So this right over here is the same thing as 27/74,

64
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:32,347
27/74 + 51/74 times i. (I'm going to write that i in that same orange color.)

65
00:04:32,347 --> 00:04:34,359
And we are done.

66
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,084
We have a real part, and we have an imaginary part.

67
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:41,000
If this last step confuses you a little bit, just remember, if it's helpful for you

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,862
that this is the same thing.

69
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,267
We're essentially multiplying both of these terms times 1/74.

70
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,533
We're dividing both of these terms by 74.

71
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:52,267
And we're distributing the 1/74 times both of these, I guess is one way to think about it.

72
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:54,600
And that's how we got this thing over here,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we have a nice real part and a nice imaginary part.
