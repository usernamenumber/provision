1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110
   

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,430
These videos were supposed to
be about e, but compound

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,380
interest was the natural
way to introduce it.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,450
And since I've already gone
down this compound interest

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,860
track, let's just keep going so
that I can put these videos in

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,920
both my mathematics and
my finance playlists.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,910
And actually, before I
continue, I just took the Excel

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,030
and I just wanted to show you
how it converges to e.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,000
So this is how many
periods I'm compounding.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,070
So in this formula
right here, this is n.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,220
This column a that I
have, right here.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,710
And then this is essentially
what happens when I evaluate 1

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,060
plus 1 over n to the n power.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,130
You can actually look
at the formula.

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,840
My Excel formula.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,750
It's 1 plus 1 over this blue
cell, to that blue power.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,810
That's just that formula.

18
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,800
And I did it for a bunch of
numbers, and I just double

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,540
the numbers every time.

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,780
So I go to a very high
number very quickly.

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,970
And you see that very quickly
it converges to this

22
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,610
number: 2.7183.

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,180
And this number just keeps
going on and going on.

24
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,160
And that number is e.

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,500
And what's interesting is, in
fact, you go to Google, and

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,750
you type in search on e.

27
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,630
They give you the number.

28
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,910
Because Google is
actually a calculator.

29
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,250
And you could look
up e other places.

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,545
And I think there are
sites that calculate e

31
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,590
to arbitrary decimals.

32
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,460
There's actually some people
who, for whatever reason, they

33
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,570
see numbers like pi and e.

34
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,430
They can see them.

35
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,020
And they can recite the digits
to arbitrary decimal places.

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,800
And I think the more you
realize-- the more you see

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,500
where e pops up in the world,
and pi, and imaginary numbers--

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,200
I think you'll realize that
these numbers, I think they're

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,780
somehow scratching the surface
of something very deep.

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,890
I mean we're just touching on
them because they pop up

41
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,340
everywhere in completely
different places

42
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,940
in the universe.

43
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,880
And they're all almost
magically related.

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,060
And I'll show you that over the
course of the next videos.

45
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,770
I think this will really give
you motivation if you're in

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,290
the mood for starting
a new cult, perhaps.

47
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,590
Well, anyway, let's continue
with the compound interest

48
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,990
before, because we need to be
able to finance our cult.

49
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,490
   

50
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,200
Or maybe our cult is
financed by giving

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,260
other people financing.

52
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,700
By being loan sharks.

53
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,575
Well, anyway, the example I
just gave was the situation

54
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,430
in which I'm charging
100% interest.

55
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,280
So let's generalize it a little
bit, to the situation where

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
I'm charging some other
percentage of interest.

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,515
So let's say I'm
charging r percent.

58
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:28,360
   

59
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh, my rate-- right.

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,580
My rate is r percent.

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,205
That's essentially what
I'm going to charge.

62
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,240
   

63
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,050
The rate will be
r, as a decimal.

64
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,040
So it'll be 10r%, if
I were to write it.

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,870
But as a decimal-- so, for
example, if I'm charging 25%,

66
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,790
my rate would be .25, and
I would write that as 25%.

67
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,790
Just to clarify.

68
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,880
So what would you owe me at
the end of the year depending

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,030
on how often I compounded?

70
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,200
Well, just going back to what
we said before, you have your

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,510
initial principal, which in
every example we've done so far

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,410
was $1.00, but I'll just write
p so we can get general.

73
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,660
And then the amount that you
owe me after one compounding

74
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,760
period is 1 times the
principal, plus my annual

75
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,800
interest rate-- so in this case
it's r-- divided by the number

76
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
of times I'm compounding.

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,270
So that's n again.

78
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,610
And I'm raising that
to the nth power.

79
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,380
And just so this makes sense to
you in the terms we thought

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,020
about, when n is-- let's say, r
is equal to 10% and

81
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,520
n is equal to 2.

82
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,635
And this is what you owe me at
the end of a year-- so if n is

83
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:48,030
equal to 2, that means we're
compounding twice over a year.

84
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,760
Or that we're charging
essentially half of this

85
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,680
rate every six months.

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,510
So if you were to borrow,
let's say, p is equal to,

87
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,370
I don't know, $50.00.

88
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,660
That's how much you
initially borrow from me.

89
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,532
So all this formula says is,
after every period you will

90
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:08,390
owe-- so, after one period,
how much will you owe?

91
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,185
This is how much you borrowed.

92
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:15,590
Then after the next period,
after six months, you'll owe

93
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,840
me this p, $50.00, plus the
interest rate divided by the

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,120
number of periods in the year.

95
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,410
So this is essentially kind of
an annual interest rate, but if

96
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,750
I'm charging you every
six months, I'm going

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,140
to divide it by 2.

98
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:44,070
So it's 10% over
2 times $50.00.

99
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,400
And this is the same
thing as what?

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,850
This is the same thing as 50
times 1 plus our rate divided

101
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,830
by the number of times
we compound, right?

102
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,650
And this is after 6 months,
as I highlight right here.

103
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,130
And then after another 6
months, I'm going to take this

104
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,960
number, and then I-- you know,
let's call this x-- and

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,650
I'm going to charge you x
plus 10% over 2 times x.

106
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:22,570
Or I'm going to charge you
x times 1 plus 10% over 2.

107
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,670
And this was x.

108
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,220
So after a full year, I'm
charging you $50.00 times

109
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,260
1 plus 10% over 2, times
1 plus 10% over 2.

110
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,660
And that's the same thing as--
well, going in the opposite

111
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,070
direction-- as $50.00 times 1
plus-- we could write this is

112
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,790
a decimal-- .1 over 2
to the second power.

113
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,000
Right?

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,830
I'm just multiplying
this times itself.

115
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,750
So, in general, when I
compound-- and now I think

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,980
you'll see the relationship
between what I just wrote out

117
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,100
there-- and experiment with
some numbers on your own if

118
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,020
you're getting a little bit
confused, or if I'm going

119
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,260
a little bit too fast.

120
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,470
Hopefully you see that this
is the same thing as this.

121
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,990
   

122
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,070
So let's see what happens as I
try to compound continuously,

123
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,795
or as n approaches infinity.

124
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:18,020
   

125
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,210
Let me get some space.

126
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,330
So the amount that you owe me--
so we can call that final

127
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:32,420
payment after a year-- payment
is equal to the amount you're

128
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,740
borrowing-- I don't like this
color-- times 1 plus the

129
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,290
interest rate over n
to the nth power.

130
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,170
Well, let's just make
a substitution.

131
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,220
Let's say that-- and I think
you'll understand why I'm doing

132
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,890
the substitution-- let's say
that r over n-- and let's say I

133
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,790
want to find the limit as n
approaches infinity, as I

134
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,420
compound continuously.

135
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,260
So the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus r

136
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,890
over n to the nth power.

137
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,920
Let's make a substitution.

138
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,970
Let's say that 1 over x
is equal to r over n.

139
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,360
If 1 over x is equal to
r over n, what is this?

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,290
Let's see, that means
that n is equal to xr.

141
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,540
Right?

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,750
I just crossed multiplied.

143
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,030
And then, if n is equal to xr,
what's-- n approaching infinity

144
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,640
is the same thing, assuming
that r is constant, that's

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,190
the same thing as x
approaching infinity.

146
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,990
Or we could view it the same
way the other way around. x

147
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,610
approaching infinity is
the same thing as n

148
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,190
approaching infinity.

149
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,740
And so we can make the
substitution here, and we get--

150
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,610
this is the same thing as the
limit as x approaches

151
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,210
infinity of what?

152
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,240
1 plus-- we said r over n is
the same thing as 1 over x,

153
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,460
we just defined it that way.

154
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,610
To the nth power.

155
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,100
But we said n-- this
substitution comes into this.

156
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,510
So n is just equal to xr.

157
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,690
Remember, r is just
a constant, right?

158
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,100
And this is the same thing as
the limit, as x approaches

159
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,990
infinity, of 1 plus
1 over x to the x.

160
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,800
And then when you multiply
exponents like that, that's

161
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,780
the same thing as that
whole expression to

162
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,140
the r power, right?

163
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,950
And this r is a
constant, right?

164
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,020
We're not taking the limit on
r, or anything like that.

165
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,570
So this is the same thing as
the limit, as x approaches

166
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:55,350
infinity, of 1 plus 1 over x
to the x, and all of

167
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,790
that to the r power.

168
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,240
And then what did we figure out
that this was in the previous

169
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,530
two or three videos?

170
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,630
Well, this is equal to e.

171
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,170
So this is equal to
e to the r power.

172
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:18,155
So if I charge an interest rate
of 10%, and I want to compound

173
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:22,210
it continuously over one year,
at the end of one year, you're

174
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,970
going to owe me e to the
10% power times the

175
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,730
original principal.

176
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,720
So we said that this is equal
to e to the r, so p times

177
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,490
this is equal to p.

178
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,580
There's a p the whole time.

179
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,590
I'll do it in the blue
so you remember.

180
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,870
I dropped the p somewhere
along the way.

181
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,500
There should have
been a p here.

182
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,820
But it's just a scaling factor.

183
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,040
Should be a p here.

184
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,430
I could have taken the p out,
because it's a constant, put

185
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,520
the p here, and it would
have stayed there.

186
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,790
But anyway, I'm about to run
out of time and I will see you

187
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,450
in the next video where we know
how much we're going to

188
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,920
pay if we continuously
compound for a year.

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,630
Let's see what we'll pay if we
continuously compound for

190
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,480
multiple years, at a rate
of r percent per year.

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:03,500
