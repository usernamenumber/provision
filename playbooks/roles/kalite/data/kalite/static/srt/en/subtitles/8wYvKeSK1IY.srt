1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:04,841
What I want to do with this video is to kind of introduce you to the idea of

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,363
how carbon 14 comes about

3
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:10,233
and how it gets into all living things

4
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:14,170
and then either later this video or in future videos we will talk about how

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,672
it's actually used to date things.

6
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:20,638
How we use it to actually to figure out that that bone is 12000 years old

7
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:24,590
or that that person died 18000 years ago whatever it might be.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,005
So let me draw the earth

9
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,000
the surface of the earth is like that

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,974
it is just a little section of the surface of the earth

11
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:33,659
earth and then we have the atmosphere of the earth

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,503
I'll draw that in yellow.

13
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:43,926
So you have the earth's atmosphere right over here.

14
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:47,548
78% - the most abundant

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:52,606
element in out atmosphere is nitrogen

16
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:56,308
I'll write nitrogen, its symbol is just N

17
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:01,649
and it has 7 protons and it also has 7 neutrons

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,993
so it has an atomic mass of roughly 14

19
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:07,640
this is the most typical isotope of nitrogen

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,021
we talk about the word isotope in the chemistry playlist.

21
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:11,733
An Isotope.

22
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,067
The protons define what element it is.

23
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:16,324
But this number up here can change

24
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,600
depending on the number of neutrons you have

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
so the different versions of a given element

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,011
- those are each called isotopes -

27
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,658
I just view them in my head as versions of an element.

28
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,333
Anyway, we have our atmosphere

29
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,677
then coming from our sun

30
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:31,603
we have what's commonly called cosmic rays

31
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:32,996
but they are actually not rays

32
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,250
they are cosmic particles

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,850
they are mainly...you could view them just as a single proton

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,312
which is the same thing as a hydrogen nucleus

35
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,148
they can also be

36
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,841
alpha particles which is the same thing as a helium nucleus

37
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,931
and there are few electrons.

38
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:46,510
And they are going to come in

39
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,321
and they are going to bumb into things in our atmosphere

40
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:54,147
they are actually going to form neutrons

41
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,334
and we'll show a

42
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,005
neutron with a lowercase n

43
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:00,349
and 1 for its mass number

44
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:04,343
and then we don't write anything as it has no protons down here

45
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,340
like we had for nitrogen with 7 protons

46
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,594
so it's not an element

47
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,591
it's a subatomic particle.

48
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,309
But you have these neutrons formed

49
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,656
and every now and then

50
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:16,510
and i'm not just.. let's be clear.. this isn't a typical reaction

51
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,578
but every now and then

52
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:18,971
one of those neutrons

53
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:28,211
will bump into one of the nitrogen 14's in just the right way

54
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:36,610
so that it bumps off one of the protons in the nitrogen

55
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,498
and essentially replaces that proton with itself

56
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,646
Let me make it clear.

57
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:42,504
So it bumps off one of the protons,

58
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:43,836
so instead of 7 protons

59
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:45,999
we now have 6 protons

60
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,018
but this number 14 does not go down to 13

61
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,969
because it replaces it with itself

62
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,244
so this still stays at 14

63
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:57,006
and now since it only has 6 protons

64
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,989
this is no longer nitrogen by definition

65
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,582
this is now carbon

66
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:03,229
and that proton that was bumped off

67
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,668
just kind of gets emitted

68
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,665
let me do this in another color

69
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:09,119
plus a proton that just flying around

70
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,238
you could call that hydrogen,

71
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:12,922
hydrogen 1,

72
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,978
and it can gain an electron someways

73
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:16,232
if it doesn't gain an electron

74
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,229
it is just a hydrogen ion

75
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,973
a positive ion

76
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:20,644
either way or a hydrogen nucleus

77
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:23,758
but this process - once again it's not a typical process

78
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:28,446
but it happens every now and then - this is how carbon 14 forms.

79
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:31,250
So this right here is carbon 14.

80
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,579
You can essentially view it

81
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,018
as a nitrogen 14 where

82
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,176
one of the protons is replaced with a neutron.

83
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,638
And what's interesting about this is that

84
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:41,187
this is constantly being formed in our atmosphere

85
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,289
not in huge quantities but in reasonable quantity.

86
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,795
Let me write this down.

87
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:47,334
...constantly being formed...

88
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:51,622
Constant Formation

89
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:52,627
And what happens is...

90
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:53,944
and let me be very clear

91
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:56,215
Let's look at the periodic table over here.

92
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,359
Typical carbon:

93
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,058
Carbon by definition has 6 protons

94
00:04:03,058 --> 00:04:04,669
but the typical isotope,

95
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,666
the most common isotope of carbon

96
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,012
is carbon 12.

97
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:11,263
So...carbon 12.

98
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:15,477
Carbon 12 is the most common.

99
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:19,333
So most of the carbon in your body is carbon 12

100
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,723
but what's interesting is,

101
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:24,346
is that a small fraction of carbon 14 forms

102
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:27,981
and this carbon 14 can then also combine with oxygen

103
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,257
to form carbon dioxide.

104
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:32,194
And then that carbon dioxide

105
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:35,319
gets absorbed into the rest of the atmosphere into, our oceans

106
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,663
it can be fixed by plants, so when people talk about

107
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,567
carbon fixation they are really talking about

108
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,003
using mainly light energy from the sun to take gaseous carbon

109
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:46,133
and turn it into actual kind of organic tissue.

110
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:52,883
And so this carbon 14 makes it's way

111
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,499
it's constantly being formed

112
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:56,326
it makes its way into

113
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:59,764
oceans...it's already in the air but it

114
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:02,347
completely mixes through the whole atmosphere

115
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,563
...oceans and the air...

116
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:05,940
and then it makes its way into

117
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,010
plants. And plants are really just

118
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,380
made out of that fixed carbon

119
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,333
that carbon that was taken in in gasous form

120
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,997
and put into, I guess you could say,

121
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:20,041
into a kind of solid form,

122
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,576
put into a living form.

123
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,245
That's what wood pretty much is.

124
00:05:23,245 --> 00:05:24,671
It gets put into plants

125
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,551
and it gets put into the things that eat

126
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,759
the plants. So that could be us.

127
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,200
Now why is this even interesting?

128
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,918
I've just explained a mechanism where

129
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,991
some of our body, even though carbon 12

130
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,338
is the most common isotope,

131
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,335
some of our body, while we're living

132
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:43,261
gets made up of this carbon 14 thing.

133
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,165
Well, the interesting thing is:

134
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:47,301
the only time you can take in this carbon 14

135
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:48,926
is while you're alive,

136
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,319
while you're eating new things.

137
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,869
Because as soon as you die

138
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:53,338
and you get buried under the ground

139
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,567
there is no way for the carbon 14

140
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,101
to become part of your tissue any more

141
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:59,840
because you're not eating anything

142
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,511
with new carbon 14.

143
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,030
And what's interesting here

144
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,320
is: once you die, you're not going to

145
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,316
get any new carbon 14, and that carbon 14

146
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,333
that you did have at your death

147
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,000
is going to...

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,911
So the carbon 14 that you did have

149
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,326
is going to decay

150
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:19,254
via beta decay.

151
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,970
And we learned about this.

152
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,270
back into nitrogen 14.

153
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,007
So this process reverses.

154
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,979
So it'll decay back into nitrogen 14.

155
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,673
In beta decay you emit an electron

156
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:36,341
and an electron anti-neutrino.

157
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,013
I'm not going into the details of that.

158
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:40,335
But essentially what you have happening here is:

159
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,319
You have one of the neutrons

160
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,329
is turning into a proton

161
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,326
and emitting this stuff

162
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,643
in the process.

163
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:49,298
Now why is this interesting?

164
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,430
So I just said while your're living

165
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,642
you have kind of straight up carbon 14.

166
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:55,400
As soon as...and carbon 14 is constantly

167
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,333
doing this decay thing.

168
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,329
But what's interesting is as soon as you die

169
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,580
and you're not ingesting any more plants

170
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,577
or breathing from the atmosphere if you

171
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,000
are a plant or fixing from the atmosphere

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,475
and this even applies to plants:

173
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,133
once the plant dies, it's no longer

174
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,986
taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

175
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:13,308
and turning it into new tissue

176
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,333
the carbon 14 in that tissue gets "frozen"

177
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,000
and this carbon 14 does this decay

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,400
at a specific rate. And then you can use that rate

179
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,007
to actually determine how long ago that thing

180
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,840
must have died. So the rate

181
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,506
at which this happens, the rate of carbon 14

182
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:42,224
decay is essentially: half disappears, half gone

183
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:49,084
in roughly 5730 years.

184
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,924
And this is acutally called a half-life.

185
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,667
And we talk about it in other videos.

186
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,667
This is called...a half life.

187
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,834
And I want to be clear here:

188
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:56,979
You don't know which half

189
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,667
of it is gone. It's a probabilistic thing.

190
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,351
You can't just say: "Oh, all of the carbon 14's

191
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,162
on the left are going to decay

192
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:03,509
and all the carbon 14's on the right aren't going to

193
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:05,320
decay in 5730 years."

194
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,396
What it's essentially saying is: Any given

195
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:10,986
carbon 14 atom has a 50% chance of

196
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:15,000
decaying into nitrogen 14

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,345
in 5730 years. So over the course of 5730 years

198
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,623
roughly half of them will have decayed.

199
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:24,451
Now why is that interesting?

200
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,138
Well, if you know that all living things

201
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:30,676
have a certain proportion of carbon 14

202
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,224
in their tissue as kind of part

203
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,756
of what makes them up

204
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,667
and then if you where to find some bones...

205
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:41,049
Let's just say you find some bone.

206
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,680
Right here.

207
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,584
You dig it up on some type of

208
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,906
archeology dig. And you say: "Hey, that bone

209
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:54,599
has one half the carbon 14 of all the

210
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,314
living things that you see right now."

211
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:59,225
So you could...it would be a pretty reasonable

212
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,284
estimate to say: "Well, that thing must

213
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:05,549
be 5730 years old." Even better maybe you

214
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,631
dig a little deeper and you find another bone

215
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,864
Maybe you find another bone.

216
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:13,262
Maybe a couple of meters even deeper.

217
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:16,002
And you say: "Wow, this thing right over here has

218
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:21,252
one fourth the carbon 14 that I would expect

219
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:23,187
to find in something living."

220
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,625
So how old is this?

221
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,607
If it only has one fourth the carbon 14,

222
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,449
it must have gone through two half-lives

223
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:30,951
after one half-life, it would have had

224
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,152
it would have one

225
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:34,431
half the carbon and then after another half-life

226
00:09:34,431 --> 00:09:38,862
half of that also turns into nitrogen 14.

227
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:43,774
And so this would involve two half-lives.

228
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:49,266
Which is the same thing as two times 5730 years.

229
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:53,002
Or you would say that this thing is what?

230
00:09:53,002 --> 00:10:00,259
...this thing is ten thousand...11460 years old

231
00:10:00,259 --> 99:59:59,999
give or take.
