1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:08,767
Evaluate the expression: 4n to the first power minus 2n to the zeroth power, for n equals 1 and n equals 5.

2
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:13,433
So let's do n equals 1 first.
So every place we see an n let's put a one in there.

3
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:22,367
So this is equal to 4 times 1 to the first power minus 2 times 1 to the zero power.

4
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:27,541
Every place we saw an n, we have an n there. We have an n to the first. n to the first, 1 to the first.

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:34,300
So remember, we want to do our order of operations. We have PEMDAS, and I'm going to write it this way just to make it clear that we do

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,767
parentheses, then exponentiation, then multiplication and division are at the same level. They get the same priority.

7
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:44,909
And then addition and subtraction get the same priority.

8
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,950
So we want to do our exponents before we do anything else. There are no parentheses here.

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,967
So we first want to evaluate 1 to the 1st power, and anything to the first power is just that anything.

10
00:00:54,967 --> 00:01:00,033
If I just have any number to the first power, that is just going to be equal to that number.

11
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,207
So 1 to the first power is just equal to 1.

12
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:13,233
So this is going to be 4 times 1. Let me write it:
4 times 1, minus 2 times 1 to the zeroth power.

13
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:18,833
Now any number other than zero to the zeroth power is going to be 1.

14
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:28,168
So if I tell you x to the zeroth power is equal to what, and I tell you that x is not equal to zero, what is x to the zeroth power?

15
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:31,047
You should immediately know that it is equal to 1.

16
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:39,174
I exclude zero because zero to the zeroth power is usually undefined, or for our purposes you can accept it to be undefined

17
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:43,033
and maybe in the future I'll do a video on explaining why its undefined, because it can either-

18
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:48,633
There are some good arguments for why it should be zero, because zero to pretty much any other power is zero.

19
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:54,567
But then there's a really good argument for why it should be 1, because any other number to the zeroth power is 1.

20
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:58,100
So thats why for the most part we like to keep this undefined.

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:06,300
So with that said, 1 to the zeroth power is just going to be 1. Anything other than zero to the zeroth power is 1.

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,633
So we have 4 times 1 which is 4, minus 2 times 1 which is 2.

23
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:13,570
So 4 minus 2 is just equal to 2.

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,824
Now lets do the same thing with n equals 5.

25
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:25,939
So it becomes 4 times 5 to the first power,
minus 2 times 5 to the zeroth power.

26
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,532
Same thing, 5 to the first power is just going to be equal to 5.

27
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:35,096
So let me do that in- I want to do that in a different color.

28
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:42,236
5 to the first power is just going to be equal to 5.
5 to the zeroth power is just going to be equal to 1.

29
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:48,644
So this experssion becomes 4 times 5, minus 2 times 1,

30
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:59,395
or 4 times 5 is 20, minus 2 times 1, that is 2.
And this is equal to 18.

31
00:02:59,395 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done!
