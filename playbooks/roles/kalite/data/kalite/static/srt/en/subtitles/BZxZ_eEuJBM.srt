99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to make a quick clarification and then add more tools in our complex number tool kit.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the first video I said that if I had a complex number z

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's equal to a+bi

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I used the word and I have to be careful about that word because you know, I use it

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in kind of the every day sense but it also has a formal reality to it.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So clearly the real part of this, of this complex number is A.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Clearly, that IS the real part and clearly this complex number is made up of real number plus an imaginary number.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I, just talking in everyday terms, I called this the imaginary part.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I called this imaginary number, this imaginary number, the imaginary part.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just be carefull there. I did make it clear that if you were to see the function,
