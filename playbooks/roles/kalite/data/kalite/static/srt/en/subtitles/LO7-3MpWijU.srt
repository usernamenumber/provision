99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video we tried to relate what 13.7 billion years really means

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by compressing it to ten years, which is still a pretty long time, at least from our perspective.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we saw that these huge periods of time, everything that's happened

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
since the United States Declaration of Independence

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all gets compressed into just five seconds!

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's, you know, that's not much when you think about ten years. I mean ten years!

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You would wait around a lot, that's a huge amount of time.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully that put things in perspective a little bit.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video is kind of do the same thing but

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relate the 13.7 billion years if that were a distance

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the length of a timeline how big each of these periods would be.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So just to start off, if the timeline...

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm recording this in High Definition right now.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There should be 1280 pixels wide, depending on where you're watching it,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so maybe you're watching it on a High-Def TV.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If the timeline was the width of my screen right over here

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If the timeline was the width of my screen here

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if that was 13.7 billion years from there

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say this is the beginning of the universe

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is our present time

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If that was 13.7 billion years the amount of time that humans, modern humans,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the people who look and think like us

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the amount of time that we have been on this planet

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will not even be a pixel

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This little dot I drew is multiple pixels.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The amount of time we have been here would not even be a pixel

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact a pixal, and that dot I drew is about four pixals, But a pixel

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just one little pixal on my screen

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would represent eleven million years.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me scroll over

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would represent eleven million, eleven million years.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if this was the timeline the dinosaurs would have been extinct

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about six pixels from the end.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it would be right about...

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So six pixels from the end is when the dinosaurs would have gotten extinct and

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the amount of time that modern humans are on the planet

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
wouldn't even register here.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would be one twentieth of that pixel over there.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact if we just expanded that very last pixel...

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we were to expand that very last pixel, I'll do it in yellow,

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the very last tiny pixel that you can't see if we were to expand that
