1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:03,120
[Sal] I'm here with our exercise guru, Ben Eater,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,419
[Ben] Hi Sal

3
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:06,298
[Sal] who made this exercise
and now we're going to try

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,675
to work through it.

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,308
So, let's see, it says "what are the factors of 9?"

6
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:13,304
"You can resize this box with 9 dots",

7
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:14,652
the box has 9 dots

8
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:16,323
"to help you find the factors"

9
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:18,113
[Ben] Yeah, so what you're looking at,

10
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:19,587
you've got, you've got these 9 dots on the screen

11
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:23,122
and right now they're just one row of 9 dots

12
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:25,313
and if you grab that little thing on the right side of the box

13
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:27,170
and move that around to the left

14
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,525
[Sal] Oh, that's neat!

15
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:30,707
[Ben] you still have 9 dots, but they're arranged differently

16
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:31,463
[Sal] I see

17
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,202
[Ben] And so, what you can see is,

18
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:34,258
try to go get them so you have the

19
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:35,282
same number in each row

20
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:37,858
[Sal] I see, so this one, so if you have

21
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,610
let's see, not the same number

22
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,413
Oh, 3, right there!

23
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:48,179
So you could get to 9 by literally multiplying 3 rows times 3 columns

24
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:48,964
[Ben] That's right.

25
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:49,846
[Sal] and you get to 9

26
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:51,029
[Ben] So 3 is a factor

27
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:55,213
[Sal] So 3, and we'd write that in this box over here

28
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:58,312
Do we have to write 3 twice? because we have...

29
00:00:58,312 --> 00:00:59,760
or is just writing 3 once?

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,549
[Ben] 3 is a factor

31
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,649
(overlapping) [Sal] 3 is a factor, we don't have to write
[Ben] so you just put it once.

32
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,183
[Sal] If we wrote it twice, would it be wrong?

33
00:01:04,183 --> 00:01:07,150
[Ben] Yes actually. We do mark that wrong.

34
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,360
[Sal] You actually do mark that wrong.

35
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,387
Ok, so there's 3 and 3

36
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:11,644
but there was also right when you started you had 9 and 1

37
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:14,198
[Ben] That's right, those are factors.

38
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,144
[Sal] and I dont have to write them in any special order?

39
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,827
[Ben] no, no. gotta get them all.

40
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:22,011
[Sal] And I belive that's all there is

41
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:23,238
And we can look at the other ones

42
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:28,901
And we could see, look 2 and 8, definitely that's not working out

43
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,120
and it's interesting for people to think

44
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,736
about why these aren't working out

45
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:33,517
[Ben] Right, yeah, you can't divide two into nine

46
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:36,223
[Sal] Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah

47
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,049
That's pretty...

48
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,562
And that just gets us to 1 and 9 again

49
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:39,581
And we don't want to repeat it.

50
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,068
[Ben] Those are the same factors

51
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:44,565
[Sal] So let's check our answer, let's see how we're doing.

52
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:45,937
There we go! We got it all right.

53
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,354
Let's do one more [Ben] Ok

54
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:52,430
[Sal] Let's do one more. Correct. Next question.

55
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,139
You can resize this box with 16 dots to help you find the factors

56
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,172
So 1 I'll just, 1 and 16 are factors

57
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,133
[Ben] 1 and 16 are factors, sure

58
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,499
Those are always factors

59
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,029
[Sal] Let me write those: 1 and 16

60
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:04,468
So let's play with this box here

61
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:06,325
So, yeah, I know, that's not working

62
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:07,922
That's not working

63
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,295
So I'm trying to figure out

64
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,940
So this is essentiall going 2 times...

65
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,859
2 might be a factor, if I could just

66
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:15,870
Oh, look it is!

67
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,956
[Ben] There it is. Two is a factor.

68
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:21,359
[Sal] Exactly, 2 rows of 8 works

69
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:25,852
So we can say 2 and 8 are factors.

70
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,739
[Ben] And if you think of it 2 and 8 both divide into 16

71
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,239
[Sal] Absolutely

72
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,543
[Ben] 2 divides 8 times or 8 divides 2 times

73
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:32,202
[Sal] Yes. You can see that.

74
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:33,804
You can construct

75
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,198
16 dots, you can divide them into 2 groups of 8

76
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,596
and I suspect also 8 groups of 2

77
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:39,250
[Ben] Well, you can see that

78
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,632
[Sal] Let's see. So that's two groups of 8

79
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:42,181
or two rows of 8

80
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,209
let's see, 4 - Oh, look at that! 4 times 4

81
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,311
[Ben] 4 times 4

82
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:47,357
[Sal] And I'll just write the 4 once

83
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:48,634
[Ben] 4 is a factor

84
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:49,391
[Sal] 4 is a factor

85
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:52,219
and then I can

86
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,228
and I've probably

87
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:55,138
I've already gotten 8 and 2

88
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:57,106
Now I've got 8 groups of 2 instead of two groups of 8

89
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:58,285
but they're still both factors

90
00:02:58,285 --> 00:03:00,680
and you go back to 16 and 1

91
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,232
So, I think we're done.

92
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,172
[Ben] I think so!

93
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,234
[Sal] Let's check our answer.

94
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:04,554
[Both] Very good!

95
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,223
[Sal] Well, thank you. That was fun.

96
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:06,738
[Ben] Thank you

97
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,931
[Sal] This was very neat. Very fun to play with.

98
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,085
[Ben] Oh, thanks.
