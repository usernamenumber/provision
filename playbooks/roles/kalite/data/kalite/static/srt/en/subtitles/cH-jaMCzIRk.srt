00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:05,459
Hello, I'm now going to do some practice least common

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,759
multiple problems for you.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,942
After I do a couple of these problems you should be able

4
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,985
to go to the least common multiple module and do

5
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:11,914
some of them yourselves.

6
00:00:13,822 --> 00:00:22,548
Let's say the least common multiple of 10 and 8.

7
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,267
I'm going to show you two ways to do a least

8
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:25,846
common multiple problem.

9
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:28,353
One I call just the brute force method and I think it's good

10
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,350
because it'll give you a good sense of what least common

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,440
multiple is and then I'll also show you what I call the

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,926
more elegant method.

13
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,852
So the brute force method is literally just to write down

14
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,824
all the multiples of the two numbers and figure out

15
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:42,936
what the least common multiple they have is.

16
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:45,211
So let's write all the multiples of 10.

17
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,837
So 10 times 1 is 10.

18
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,066
10 times 2 is 20.

19
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:54,546
30, 40, 50, 60, whoops.

20
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:56,264
Not 67.

21
00:00:56,264 --> 00:01:02,347
70, 80, 90, 100 and so on.

22
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:12,843
Multiples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48,

23
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:17,626
64, 72, 80 and so on.

24
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:18,741
So let's see.

25
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,481
Let's see if we can identify what the common multiples are.

26
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:27,100
Well, immediately I see that 10 times 4 is 40 and 8 times 5 is

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,190
also 40, so that's a common multiple.

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,112
If we keep going we see that 10 times 8 is 80 and 8

29
00:01:34,112 --> 00:01:36,852
times 10 is also 80.

30
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:39,128
And if we were to keep going we would also see that

31
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:41,171
120 is a common multiple.

32
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,075
We'd see that 160 is a common multiple.

33
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:46,976
But out of the ones we listed 40 and 80 are

34
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,137
our common multiples.

35
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:50,088
And if we were to ask, what is the least common multiple?

36
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:54,592
Well, 40 is lower than 80, so we say 40 is the

37
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,682
least common multiple.

38
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:59,608
That's what I call the brute force method.

39
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,162
Now what I would say the elegant method is, is what you

40
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:06,945
do is you look at the factors of 10 and you say, well, the

41
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:14,422
factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

42
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:22,060
And the factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,314
And you say, what's the greatest common factor

44
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:27,054
of the two numbers?

45
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:29,933
Well, they all share the common factor one.

46
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,859
Every integer shares that common factor.

47
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:35,181
But the number 2.

48
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:39,360
They both share that common factor.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,073
So what we can say is, is that the least common multiple of 10

50
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:48,463
and 8-- and this is the elegant way and it might not be obvious

51
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,249
to you why it works and I might do another module with you

52
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,921
to show you why this works.

53
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,568
But the least common multiple of two numbers is always equal

54
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:00,258
to the two numbers-- 8 times 10-- and the dot is this

55
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,277
another fancy way of writing times.

56
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:08,200
8 times 10 and then you divide that by the greatest

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,683
common factor of 8 and 10.

58
00:03:11,683 --> 00:03:16,094
Well, 8 times 10 is 80, and the greatest common

59
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:17,348
factor of 8 and 10?

60
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:18,881
Well, we just figured that out.

61
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,878
That's 2.

62
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:22,967
So that equals 40.

63
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:26,961
In general, in my head, and you'll learn to do these

64
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,447
problems, in your head.

65
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:30,073
I tend to do it this first way.

66
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,488
I don't figure out what the greatest common factor is

67
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,067
and then I multiply the numbers and divide them.

68
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:37,550
Because for smaller numbers like 8 or 10 or two and 3, it's

69
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,964
pretty easy to just think about the multiples and figure out

70
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:41,590
the least common multiple.

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,503
But if you had really large numbers or if you're writing a

72
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:48,091
computer program, that had to deal with arbitrary numbers,

73
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:50,739
then you'd probably want to use the second method.

74
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,804
And if you're ever in doubt the second method always works just

75
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:56,822
to make sure you haven't overlooked some numbers in

76
00:03:56,822 --> 00:04:01,100
using the method on the left.
