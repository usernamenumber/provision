00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
What I want to do in this video is analyze why it makes sense for two companies that make up a duopoly

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,791
to coordinate, to get into an agreement which may or may not be legal

3
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:15,004
- probably would be illegal -

4
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:21,087
and restrict quantity but also think about why there's a strong incentive for either or both parties

5
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,810
to cheat their agreement and produce more quantity than they agreed to produce.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:32,453
So let's say that both of our players in our duopoly - and this would actually apply to an oligopoly generally,

7
00:00:32,453 --> 00:00:36,370
but the analysis would be a little bit more difficult if we had more than two players -

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,105
but let's say each player - they're identical companies

9
00:00:40,105 --> 00:00:44,420
and they both have a marginal cost curve that looks something like that.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,006
So they both have a marginal cost curve, an individual marginal cost curve that looks like that,

11
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:54,963
and they both have an average total cost curve that looks something like this.

12
00:00:54,963 --> 00:01:01,257
So they both have an average total cost curve that looks something like that,

13
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:06,972
and they are identical, so I'll just draw it once: this is the marginal cost and average total cost for both firms.

14
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:10,289
Now, let's think about what it would look like for the market.

15
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:17,189
Well, one way to think about it - pick an arbitrary marginal cost.

16
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,422
So for one firm, what can they produce - or what quantity will they be at that marginal cost?

17
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:26,973
Well, they'll be at this quantity for that marginal cost, but if you have two firms that are just like that,

18
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:32,108
they could have twice as much quantity to be at that point in marginal cost.

19
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:36,924
So the two firms will be over there, and if you picked this marginal cost,

20
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:42,408
one firm would produce that quantity to be right at that marginal cost for that next incremental good,

21
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:46,190
but two firms could produce two - especially if they had the exact same cost structure.

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:53,374
So what you're going to have, is you're essentially adding this curve to itself in the horizontal direction.

23
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:56,758
So if you look at the marginal cost curve for both firms together,

24
00:01:56,758 --> 00:02:02,676
you're essentially going to get a curve that is twice as fat as the marginal cost curve for one firm.

25
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:06,910
So it will look something like this, and I'll do it in yellow.

26
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,373
So it will look something like that.

27
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:17,073
So that is the marginal cost for the market, where the market in this example is both of these firms.

28
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:22,241
And that will also be true for the average total cost.

29
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:29,241
If at this price - or actually I should say - if the average total cost is up here for one firm,

30
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,207
that means they are producing this quantity,

31
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:37,243
but two firms together could produce twice the quantity of that average total cost.

32
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,476
So two firms would produce twice.

33
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:43,181
And so, what you're gonna have is an average total cost curve that is twice as fat

34
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:47,024
as the average total cost curve for one firm, if you're talking about the market.

35
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:52,608
So the market's average total cost curve is going to look something like this, it's going to be twice as fat,

36
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:59,142
it's the exact same logic. It's going to look something like that.

37
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:04,358
So that is the average total cost curve for the market.

38
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:08,758
So so far the convention that I've ended up using is orange for an individual firm,

39
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:13,994
and then this dotted yellow line for the market as a whole.

40
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,783
Now, let's think about what a good equilibrium -

41
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:24,937
or what the right price should be if they were able to coordinate together.

42
00:03:24,937 --> 00:03:29,117
If they were to essentially combine their firms and almost behave like a monopoly.

43
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:31,994
And to think about that, we're going to have to draw a demand curve.

44
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,510
So let me draw the market demand curve.

45
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,077
Let's say the market demand curve looks something like that.

46
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:42,560
It's really big so it's hard for me to - well assume that this is a line.

47
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,627
Well, that's pretty good.

48
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:52,160
So this is the market demand curve.

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,795
So if both of these firms operated together -

50
00:03:55,795 --> 00:04:02,034
and oh, if I drew the market demand curve, I also want to draw the market marginal revenue curve.

51
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,548
Now remember, we're going to assume that both of these firms are acting together.

52
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:11,114
If they perfectly coordinate, they can join their capacities and act, essentially, like a monopoly.

53
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:18,915
So if they did act like a monopoly, their marginal revenue curve would be twice the slope of this market demand curve.

54
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:25,464
So it would hit the horizontal axis right over there, and it would something like this.

55
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:38,383
So this right over here is the market marginal revenue curve.

56
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:43,598
So if they were to behave like a monopoly, you could view this dotted line as their marginal cost curve;

57
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:47,510
this would be their average total cost, and now this is their marginal revenue.

58
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,382
If they were to behave as a monopoly, what would be the optimal quantity?

59
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:55,100
Well, it would be right there, right where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

60
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,549
Before that they keep wanting to produce because marginal revenue is higher than marginal quantity -

61
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,700
or marginal revenue is higher than marginal cost,

62
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,065
and then after that they don't want to produce, because marginal cost is higher than marginal revenue,

63
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:11,383
and they're going to take economic losses on each of those incremental units.

64
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,966
And so, this is the quantity that they would produce,

65
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:17,950
and the price they would get for that, they just have to go to the market demand curve,

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,482
they would get this price right over here.

67
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:25,268
Let's say they would get that price right over there.

68
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:32,167
The average total cost per unit - once again, we have to go to the market here -

69
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:36,768
it's this dotted line right over here, that is their average total cost per unit.

70
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:44,135
So their average economic profit per unit is going to be their revenue per unit minus their average total cost per unit.

71
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:49,684
So this height is their economic profit per unit.

72
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:57,385
If we multiply that times the total number of units, you would get their total economic profit,

73
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:03,201
if they coordinate perfectly, essentially behaving like a monopoly.

74
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,751
And let's just say for argument, that this height right over here,

75
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:08,202
let's say that that is 10,

76
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:15,102
and let's say that this quantity that they would want to produce as a monopolist, is 50.

77
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:18,119
So what is the total economic profit here?

78
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:22,113
Well, their total economic profit is 500.

79
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:32,665
Their total economic profit - if they coordinate - is 500.

80
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:42,337
So they see this, and they say: "Look! Why don't we agree to each produce exactly half of this, and we would split the economic profit."

81
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:48,304
And to see that, let's just say one firm says OK - they both decide that they're going to produce 25.

82
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,752
They're going to get this price for it up here, which was the market price,

83
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:56,520
they're going to get that price for it, and their costs are right here.

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,603
Now we're going to talk about each individual firm, and that makes sense because

85
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,771
this cost is just twice as far away as this cost

86
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:08,721
and the dotted line yellow average total cost for the market is just a fatter version -

87
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:16,205
twice as fat as the orange line, so each firm will make this much economic profit per unit times 25 units.

88
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:21,520
And so each firm would make this orange area in terms of economic profit,

89
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:30,556
or half of the entire 500, or 250 per firm.

90
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:37,006
Now let's think about why there is an incentive for one or both of the firms to cheat.

91
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,689
Let's say one firm in particular.

92
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,673
So the other firm holds at 25 units, but the other firm says:

93
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:49,790
"Hey, I like this price, I'm already making economic profit, let me produce 10 more units."

94
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:56,605
So the other firm says: "I'm not going to produce 25, I'm going to produce 35 units."

95
00:07:56,605 --> 00:08:02,875
And if that guy produces 35 units, and the other firm in the market,

96
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:07,190
the other duopolist I guess we could say, continues to produce at 25,

97
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:14,513
then the total market production is now going to be 60.

98
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:17,077
Now what is the total economic profit?

99
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:26,590
So we can go up the demand curve, right over there, that's the new price.

100
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,994
The cost per unit is this right over here.

101
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:39,603
And then the number of units that they're producing is 60, so the new economic profit is this area,

102
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,696
in this blueish, purplish color that I just drew.

103
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:49,513
And even visually this is true, looks like the demand curve and the average total cost curve have gotten closer together.

104
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:53,630
So let's say that this height right over here is 8.

105
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:00,513
And it's going to be $8 of economic profit per unit times 60 units.

106
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:05,405
So if they cheat, let's talk about the cheating circumstance, if they cheat -

107
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:08,203
this was 'coordinate' - now let's think about if they cheat.

108
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:14,384
Now, we have 60 units for the whole market times $8 of economic profit per unit.

109
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:23,184
You're going to have total economic profit of 480.

110
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,433
Your total economic profit went down, and that makes sense,

111
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:29,734
because now, as a market, you're producing beyond the point

112
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,300
where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

113
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,748
Now, marginal cost as a market is higher than marginal revenue,

114
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:41,581
and so all of this is - essentially you're creating economic loss,

115
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:49,536
because each of these incremental units - the cost is higher than the revenue and you have an economic loss,

116
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:55,332
and that's why your total economic profit as a market went down from 500 to 480.

117
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:59,718
But how much is this character going to be making?

118
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:01,830
The one that decided to cheat?

119
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,119
Well, he now has 35 units,

120
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,517
he's producing 35 units,

121
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:10,501
and he's getting an economic profit of $8 per unit.

122
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,900
So he gets this entire area right over here.

123
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:27,417
So let's multiply 35 times 8, that's 280.

124
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:36,002
So now the cheating firm has $280 of economic profit in this period,

125
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,252
and then the honest firm, or the fair firm

126
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,803
- what they're both doing might be illegal by even attempting to coordinate -

127
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:44,719
the 'non-cheater' I guess I could call him,

128
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,054
the non-cheater will have the rest.

129
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:53,252
The non-cheater is going to have the balance of the economic profit,

130
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,669
and the total economic profit was 480, the cheater is getting 280,

131
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:00,070
the non-cheater is only going to get 200.

132
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,919
So the cheater definitely benefited by increasing quantity past that optimal one.

133
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,817
He went from 250 to 280, so it made sense for him.

134
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:17,890
It reduced the total economic profit, and it really hurt the non-cheat right over there.
