1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
   

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,150
In the last video, we talked
about how the cell uses a

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,280
sodium potassium pump and ATP
to maintain its potential

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,110
difference between the inside
of the cell or the inside of

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,680
the neuron and the outside-- and
in general, the outside is

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,330
more positive than the inside.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,290
You have a -70 millivolt
potential difference from the

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,000
inside to the outside.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,340
It's minus because the outside
is more positive.

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,480
Less positive minus more
positive, you're going to get

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,730
a negative number
and it's by -70.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,880
Now, I said that this was the
foundation for understanding

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,690
how neurons actually
transmit signals.

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,730
And to understand that, I'll
kind of lay a foundation over

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,490
that foundation.

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,710
I think then just the actual
neuron transmission will make

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,760
a lot of sense.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,910
Even better, it'll make a lot
of sense why they even have

19
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,070
these myelin sheaths and these
nodes of Ranvier and why we

20
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,120
have all of these dendrites.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,390
Hopefully it'll all
fit together.

22
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,250
So there are two types of
ways that kind of a

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,160
potential can travel.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,290
So there's two types
of signal transfer.

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,290
I'll just call it
signal transfer.

26
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,260
I don't know what the
best word for it is.

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,710
The first one I'll talk
is electrotonic.

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,190
It sounds very fancy,
but you'll see it's

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,440
a very simple idea.

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:21,020
   

31
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,670
And the other one I'm
going to go over

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,350
is an action potential.

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,770
And they both have their own
positives and negatives in

34
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,760
terms of being able to
transmit a signal.

35
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,360
We're talking about within the
context of in a cell or across

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,270
a cell membrane.

37
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,940
Let's understand what
these mean.

38
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,780
So let me get my membrane
of a cell.

39
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,310
Let's say it's a nerve cell or
a neuron, just to make it all

40
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,130
fit together in this context.

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,050
And we know it's more
positive on the

42
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,300
outside than the inside.

43
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,520
We know that there's a lot of
sodium on the outside or a lot

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,280
more sodium on the outside
than on the inside.

45
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,320
There might be a little bit.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,660
And we know there's a lot more
potassium on the inside than

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,180
the outside, but we know
generally that the outside is

48
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,070
more positive then the inside
because our sodium potassium

49
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,630
pump will pump out three
sodiums for every two

50
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,430
potassiums it takes in.

51
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,060
Now in the last video, I told
you that there are these

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,485
things called-- well, we could
call them a sodium gate.

53
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,810
A sodium ion gate, right?

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,430
These are all ions.

55
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,990
They're charged.

56
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,420
Now let's say that there's some
reason, some stimulus--

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,670
let me label this.

58
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,430
   

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,990
That right there is my
sodium ion gate.

60
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,660
And it's in its closed position,
but let's say

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,480
something causes it to open.

62
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,700
We'll talk maybe in this video
or maybe this video and the

63
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,330
next about the different
things that

64
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,200
could cause it to open.

65
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,100
Maybe it's some type of stimulus
causes this to open.

66
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,910
Actually, there's a whole bunch
of different stimuluses

67
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,480
that would cause it to open.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,370
But let's say it opens.

69
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,560
What's going to happen
if it opens?

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
So let's say we open it.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,790
Some stimulus opens-- what's
going to happen?

72
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,880
We have more positive on the
outside than the inside, so

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,460
positive things want
to move in.

74
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,400
And this is a sodium gate so
only sodium can go through it.

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,960
So it's kind of a convoluted
protein structure that only

76
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
sodium can make its
way through.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,840
And on top of that, we have a
lot more sodium on the outside

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,510
than on the inside.

79
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,580
So the diffusion gradient's
going to want to make sodium

80
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,320
go through it.

81
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,650
And the fact that sodium's a
positive ion, the outside is

82
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,270
more positive, they're going to
want to run away from that

83
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,340
positive environment.

84
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,810
So if you open this, you're just
going to have a lot of

85
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,040
sodium ions start to
flood through.

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,250
   

87
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,190
Now as that happens, what's
going to happen if we go

88
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,500
further down the membrane?

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,110
Let's zoom out.

90
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,650
So let's say that this is
my membrane right there.

91
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's say that this is my open
gate right here and that it's

92
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,990
open for some reason and a bunch
of sodium is flowing in.

93
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,050
So all of this is becoming
much more positive.

94
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,980
Let's say we had a voltmeter
right here.

95
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,230
We're measuring the potential
difference between the inside

96
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,420
of the membrane a
and the outside.

97
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,580
Let me do a little chart.

98
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,190
I'm going to do the chart
here on my voltmeter.

99
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,579
And this is going to be the
potential difference-- or

100
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,750
we'll call it the membrane
voltage or the voltage

101
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,000
difference across the
membrane-- and

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,150
let's say this is time.

103
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,460
Let's say I haven't opened
this gate yet.

104
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,030
So it's in its resting state.

105
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,100
Our sodium potassium
pumps are working.

106
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,090
Things are leaking back and
forth, but it's staying at

107
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,790
that minus 70 millivolts.

108
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,770
So that right there is
minus 70 millivolts.

109
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,110
Now as soon as this gate that's
way down some other

110
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,770
part of the cell opens, what's
going to happen?

111
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,910
And let's say that's the
only thing that's open.

112
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,370
So this, all of a sudden, is
going to become more positive.

113
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,180
So positive charges that's
already here-- so other

114
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,480
positive charges, whether
they're sodiums or potassiums,

115
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,260
they're going to want to run
away from that point because

116
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,480
this area hasn't had a flood
of positive things.

117
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,840
So it's less positive
than this over here.

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,670
So maybe we have some potassiums
and maybe we have

119
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,960
some sodiums. Everything is
going to want to move away

120
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,310
from the place where
this is opened.

121
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,590
The charge is going to
want to move away.

122
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,910
So as soon as this happens, as
soon as we open this gate,

123
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,460
we're going to have a
movement of positive

124
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,230
charge in this direction.

125
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,830
So all of a sudden-- this was
at minus 70 millivolts.

126
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,240
So more positive charge
is coming its way.

127
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,680
   

128
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
Almost immediately, it's going
to become less negative or

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,470
more positive.

130
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,590
The potential difference between
this and this is going

131
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,800
to become less.

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,980
So this is this point
over here.

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,900
Now if we took this point, if we
did the same thing-- if we

134
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,120
measured the voltage at this
point right here, maybe it was

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,150
at minus 70 millvolts, maybe a
fraction of a minute amount of

136
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,560
time later, the positive charge
starts affecting it so

137
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,020
it becomes more positive, but
the effect is diluted, right?

138
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,660
Because these positive charges,
they're going to

139
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,240
radiate in every direction.

140
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,410
So the effect is diluted.

141
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,130
So the effect on this thing
is going to be less.

142
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,860
It's going to become
less positive.

143
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,160
So an electrotonic potential--
what happens is at one point

144
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,390
in the cell, a gate opens,
charge starts flooding in, and

145
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,460
it starts affecting the
potential at other

146
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,630
parts of the cell.

147
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,970
But the positive of it is, it's
very fast. As soon as

148
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,820
this happens.

149
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,000
further down the cell, it starts
becoming more and more

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,820
positive, but the further you
go, the effect gets dissipated

151
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,570
with distance.

152
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,050
So if you care about speed,
you'd want this

153
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,240
electrotonic potential.

154
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,620
As soon as it happens, it'll
start affecting the rest of

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,750
the cell, but if you wanted
this potential change to

156
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,660
travel over large distances--
for example, let's say if we

157
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,030
got all the way to this point of
the neuron and we wanted to

158
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,210
measure it, it might not
have any impact.

159
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,410
Maybe a little bit later, but
it's not having any impact

160
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,920
because all of this gets diluted
by the time it gets--

161
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,960
it's increasing the charge
throughout the cell.

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,200
So it's a impact far away from
the initial place where the

163
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,750
gate opened.

164
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,240
It's going to be a lot less.

165
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,110
So it's really not good for
operating over distance.

166
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,040
Now let's try to figure
out what's going on

167
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,080
with an action potential.

168
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,310
And you might understand, this
might involve more action.

169
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,510
So let's start off with
the same situation.

170
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:51,500
We have a sodium gate that gets
opened by some stimulus.

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,730
What I'm going to do-- let me
draw two membranes here.

172
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,980
So this is the outside.

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,500
   

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,440
This is the inside.

175
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,680
And let me draw-- maybe we're
dealing with a-- and we'll go

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,270
in more detail.

177
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,870
Maybe this is an axon or
something, but let me-- let's

178
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,810
say we have another sodium
gate right here.

179
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,810
   

180
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,700
And then they're alternating,
essentially.

181
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,090
So they're alternating so then
I have another sodium gate.

182
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:38,520
   

183
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,980
I don't want to do
a bunch of these.

184
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,980
I think I just have to draw one
round of it for you to get

185
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,730
what's going on.

186
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,350
Let me draw another
potassium gate.

187
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,140
   

188
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,290
And let's say that they
all start closed.

189
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,240
So they're all in the
closed position.

190
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,750
Now let's say that this sodium
gate gets stimulated.

191
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,000
It gets opened.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,220
   

193
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,740
Let's say that guy right
there gets opened.

194
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,670
It gets stimulated by something
to get opened.

195
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,860
We'll talk about the things
that-- let's say in particular

196
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:20,160
this thing gets opened-- let's
say the stimulus-- it has to

197
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,210
be a certain voltage.

198
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,170
And let's say they become open
when we are at minus 55

199
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,420
millivolts.

200
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,400
   

201
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,910
So when we're just in our
resting state, the potential

202
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,270
difference between the inside of
the cell and the outside is

203
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,380
minus 70, so it's not
going to be open.

204
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,420
It's going to be closed, but if
for whatever reason, this

205
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,520
becomes positive enough to get
to minus 55 millivolts, all of

206
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,440
a sudden this thing
will be open.

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,730
Let's write a couple of other
rules that dictate what

208
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,630
happens to this gate.

209
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,880
Let's say it closes-- and these
are all rough numbers,

210
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,260
but the main idea is for you
to get the general idea.

211
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:10,910
Let's say it closes at--
I don't know-- plus 35

212
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,870
millivolts.

213
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:20,303
And let's say that our potassium
gate opens at plus

214
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:24,280
40 millvolts, just to give
an idea of things.

215
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:33,110
Let's say it closes at--
I don't know-- minus 80

216
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,360
millivolts.

217
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,210
   

218
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,010
So what's going to happen?

219
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,040
Lets say that, for whatever
reason, the voltage here has

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,620
now become minus 55.

221
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,830
Let me do a chart just
like I did down here.

222
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,855
So I want to have space
to draw my chart.

223
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:54,110
   

224
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,360
This is membrane voltage.

225
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,370
   

226
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,080
And this is time down here.

227
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,180
And let's say we're measuring
it-- let's say this is the

228
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,790
membrane voltage at-- let's say
right by the sodium gate

229
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,150
right here.

230
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,350
So we're measuring this voltage

231
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,480
across this right here.

232
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,200
So if it's not stimulated any
way, we're just here,

233
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,060
flatlining at minus 70
millivolts-- and let's say

234
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,830
some stimulus, for
whatever reason,

235
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,620
makes this more positive.

236
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,950
Maybe it's some type of
electrotonic effect that's

237
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,430
making it more positive here.

238
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,440
Maybe some positive charges
are floating by.

239
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,860
So this becomes more positive.

240
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,540
So let's say this becomes more
positive and then the ATP

241
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,520
pumps-- the sodium potassium
pumps pump it out so it

242
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,780
doesn't get to the threshold of
minus 55, so then nothing

243
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,620
will happen, right?

244
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,640
It didn't get to
the threshold.

245
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,710
But then let's say there's
another electrotonic or maybe

246
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,950
a bunch of them and just there's
a lot of positive

247
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,480
charge here so we get to
the minus 55 millvolts.

248
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
Remember, when positive
charge comes by,

249
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,130
we become less negative.

250
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,110
The potential difference
becomes less negative.

251
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,710
We get to that minus
55 volts-- this

252
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,950
thing opens then, right?

253
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,200
This was closed before.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,380
It was closed when we were
just at minus 70.

255
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,230
So let me write here.

256
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:20,320
So at this point, our
sodium gate opens.

257
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
Now, what's going to happen when
our sodium gate opens?

258
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,780
When that opens-- we've seen
this show before-- all the

259
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,500
positively charged sodium is
going to go down there, both

260
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,490
electric gradient and diffusion
gradient, and

261
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,340
there's going to flood
into the cell.

262
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,200
There's so much sodium out
there, it's so positive out

263
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,910
there, they just want
to come in.

264
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,350
So as soon as they hit that
threshold, even though this

265
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,910
might've only gotten us to minus
55 or maybe minus 50,

266
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,440
all of a sudden that gate opens
and we have all of this

267
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,170
positive charge flooding
into the cell.

268
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,480
So the potential difference
becomes

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,800
much, much more positive.

270
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,810
   

271
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,380
So they keep flooding in,
becomes much, much more

272
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,220
positive, but as it gets
more positive, it

273
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:15,340
closes at plus 35 millvolts.

274
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,880
So let's say that we're dealing
here-- let's say that

275
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,310
this up here is plus
35 millvolts.

276
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,720
So here it closes and at the
same time, that stuff I just

277
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,550
deleted-- I set at plus 40
millvolts-- or let's say at

278
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,320
plus 35, just for the
sake of argument.

279
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,840
Let's say at plus 45
millvolts, our

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,520
sodium gates open.

281
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,650
So what's happened here?

282
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,990
All of a sudden, we're at plus
35 or maybe plus 40 millivolts

283
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,430
so this is-- let's just say plus
40, I think you get the

284
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,840
idea either way so we'll say
plus 40-- either way.

285
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,100
So at plus 40, this guy's
going to close.

286
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,640
No more positive ions are coming
in, but now we are at

287
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,340
more positive inside, at least
locally at this point on the

288
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,070
membrane, than we are outside.

289
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,720
And so this gate will open.

290
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,220
So then our sodium
gate will open.

291
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,320
K-plus ion gate opens.

292
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Now when that opens,
what happens?

293
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,800
We have all of these
sodium ions here.

294
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,370
We already saw from the sodium
potassium pump that the

295
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,510
potassium-- we have all of these
potassium ions here.

296
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,150
We saw from the sodium potassium
pump that it makes

297
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,280
the sodium concentration on
the outside higher and the

298
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,300
potassium concentration
on the inside higher.

299
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,330
And now that we've gotten to
this plus 40 millvolt range,

300
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,140
we're also now more positive
on the inside.

301
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,360
So this opens.

302
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,320
These guys want to escape
because there's

303
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,200
less potassium outside.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,290
They want to go down their
concentration gradient.

305
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,940
It's also very positive
on the inside.

306
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,970
We're at plus 40 millvolts.

307
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,480
So they also want to escape.

308
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,500
So they start escaping
the cells.

309
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,350
So positive charges starts
exiting the cell from the

310
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,210
inside to the outside.

311
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,920
So we become less
positive again.

312
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,550
So let me write what
happens here.

313
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,530
So at this point, our sodium
gate closes and our potassium

314
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,140
gate opens.

315
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,920
   

316
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,250
And then the positive charge
starts flooding out of the

317
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,300
cell again and maybe it'll
overshoot because it's only

318
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,670
going to close maybe once we
get to minus 80 millvolts.

319
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:30,660
So maybe our potassium gate
closes at minus 80.

320
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,340
And then our sodium potassium
pump might get us back to our

321
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,550
minus 70 millvolts.

322
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,940
So, this is what's happening
just at this point in the

323
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,720
cell, just near that
first sodium gate.

324
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,040
But what's going to happen
in general, right?

325
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,680
As this became very positive--
we went to 40

326
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,340
millivolts over here.

327
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,490
We went to 40 millvolts in
this area of the cell.

328
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,970
Because of-- I guess you could
almost view it as a short term

329
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,120
or very short distance
electrotonic potential, this

330
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,760
area is going to become
more positive, right?

331
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,910
This is going to become
more positive.

332
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,300
These positive charges
are going to go

333
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,970
where it's less positive.

334
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,040
So this is going to become
more positive.

335
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,970
This was at minus 70, but it's
going to become more positive.

336
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,200
It'll go to minus 65, minus 60,
minus 55-- and then bam.

337
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,780
This guy will get
triggered again.

338
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,060
Then this guy gets opened.

339
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,440
Then this guy gets opened.

340
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,430
Sodium floods in through here.

341
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,840
So if you wanted to plot this
guy's, the potential

342
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,240
difference of what's going on
across this, this all happened

343
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,630
as soon as-- maybe as soon as a
sodium started going in this

344
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,440
first dude, the second guy-- he
gets triggered here because

345
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,640
the second guy a little bit
later in time-- because of all

346
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,700
this flow a little bit to
the left of him, his

347
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,540
potential goes up.

348
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,230
He gets triggered, same exact
thing happens to him, right?

349
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,300
When the sodium flows in here,
becomes really positive around

350
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,630
here, that makes the cell
around here, the voltage

351
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,180
around here, the charge around
here a little bit more

352
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,930
positive, triggers this next
sodium gate to open and then

353
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,280
this whole same thing
happens, same cycle.

354
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,660
Then the potassium gates open to
make it negative again, but

355
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,960
by the time that's happened,
it's become positive over here

356
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,630
to trigger another
sodium gate.

357
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,069
So one after another, you have
these sodium gates opening and

358
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,839
closing, but it's transmitting
that information, it's

359
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,270
transmitting that potential
change.

360
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,130
So what's going on here?

361
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,990
So this is slower and it
actually involves energy.

362
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,200
So this was-- the electrotonic
was very fast. This is slow.

363
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,820
An action potential is slower.

364
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,350
I don't want to say it's slow.

365
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,400
It's slower because it has to
involve these opening and

366
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,420
closing of gates and it
also involves energy.

367
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,275
It also requires more energy.

368
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:47,880
   

369
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,440
And you're also going to have to
keep changing the potential

370
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,130
in your cell and you actively
have your sodium potassium

371
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,700
pumps being very active.

372
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,770
But it's good.

373
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,480
The positive is, it's good
at covering distance.

374
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,330
   

375
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,820
When you have something like
this-- we saw with the

376
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,160
electrotonic, as we get further
and further away from

377
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,120
where the stimulus happened,
the change in potential

378
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,325
becomes more and more
dissipated.

379
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,080
It actually exponentially
declines.

380
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,440
It becomes more and more
dissipated as we get further

381
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,030
and further away so it's not
good for long distance.

382
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,600
This thing can just continue
forever because every time it

383
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,170
stimulates the next gate, it's
like we're starting all over

384
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,940
again and so this gate-- it's
going to have a flood of ions

385
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,550
come in and those ions are going
to make it a little less

386
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,780
negative over here.

387
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,110
Then the next gate's
going to open.

388
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,750
We're going to have the cycle
over and over again.

389
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,210
So this is really good for
traveling long distances.

390
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,850
So now we have really the
foundation to understand

391
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,880
exactly what's happening in a
neuron and I'm going to go

392
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,330
over that in the next video to
show you how electrotonic

393
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,820
potentials and action potentials
can combine to have

394
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,970
a signal travel through
a neuron.

395
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,220
