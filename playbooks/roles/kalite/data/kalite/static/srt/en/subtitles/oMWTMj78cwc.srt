1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Let's say we have three
matrices, A, B, and C.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,850
And let's say that B and C are
both m by n matrices, and that

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,280
A is a, let's call it
a k by m matrix.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,830
And what I want to do is figure
out whether matrix

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,730
products exhibit the
distributive property.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,340
So let's test out A
times B plus C.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,480
And of course these
are all matrices.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,770
So B, just to make things clear,
the matrix B could be

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:44,080
represented as just a bunch of
column vectors, B1, B2, all

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,030
the way to Bn.

11
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,630
And the matrix C can also be
represented as just a bunch of

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,160
column vectors.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,860
So could the matrix A,
but I don't have to

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,410
draw that just yet.

15
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,410
So the matrix C could just be
represented as a bunch of

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,090
column vectors, C1, C2,
all the way to Cn.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,270
Maybe I should've drawn
this taller.

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,200
These are column vectors, so
they actually have some

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,510
verticality to them.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,030
I think you've seen that
multiple times.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,830
So what is A times B plus C?

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,760
Well, let's figure out
what B plus C is.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,590
This is equal to A
times B plus C.

24
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,450
When you add B plus C, the
definition of matrix addition

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,810
is, you just add the
corresponding columns.

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,030
Which essentially boils
down to adding the

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,040
corresponding entries.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,380
So the first column is going
to be equal to B1 plus C1.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,770
The second column is going
to be B2 plus C2.

30
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,850
And you're going to go all the
way to the nth column.

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,610
It's going to be Bn plus Cn.

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,940
Now by our definition of
matrix-matrix products, this

33
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,880
product right here is going to
be equal to the matrix, where

34
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,980
we take the matrix A and
multiply it by each of the

35
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,460
column vectors of this matrix
here, of B plus C.

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,680
Which as you can imagine,
these are both m by n.

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,250
In fact they both have to have
the same dimensions for this

38
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,100
addition to be well defined.

39
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,360
So this is going to be
an m by n matrix.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,170
I already you told you
that A is a k by m.

41
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,750
And we know this is well defined
because A has the same

42
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,190
number of columns as B
plus C has of rows.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,450
So this is well defined.

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,220
And this is going to be equal
to-- let me switch colors

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:35,720
again-- A times the column
vector B1 plus C1.

46
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,030
The second column is going to
be A times the column vector

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,580
B2 plus C2.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,790
I'm running out of space.

49
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,740
This is going to be all the
way to A times the column

50
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,950
vector Bn plus Cn.

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,040
This is our definition of
matrix-matrix products.

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,560
You just take the first matrix
and you multiply it times each

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,660
of the column vectors of
the second matrix.

54
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,150
And we can say that because
we've already defined

55
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,420
matrix-vector products.

56
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,015
So what is this thing on
the right equal to?

57
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,280
I'll keep switching colors.

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,850
We know that matrix-vector
products exhibit the

59
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,850
distributive property.

60
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,900
I don't even remember when
I did that video.

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,200
But we've assumed
it for a while.

62
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,990
It's a very trivial
thing to prove.

63
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,650
So each of these columns is
going to be equal to, let me

64
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,380
write this way.

65
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,340
This guy right here
can be re-written.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,050
The first column is going to be
A times column vector B1,

67
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,520
plus A times the column
vector C1.

68
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,430
This term right there
is the same thing as

69
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,320
that term right there.

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,840
The next one is going to
be AB2 plus matrix A

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,910
times the vector C2.

72
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,870
And then the nth column is going
to be the matrix-- keep

73
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,760
going-- A times the column
vector Bn, plus matrix A times

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,360
the column vector C.

75
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,550
Just like that.

76
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,780
Now we can write this
matrix as the sum of

77
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,190
two different matrices.

78
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,590
So what is this going
to be equal to?

79
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,390
This is equal to-- let me see,
I'll just write it right

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:28,830
here-- AB1 as the first column,
AB2 as the second

81
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,400
column, all the way to ABn
as the third column.

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,370
So that's these terms
right there.

83
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,030
And then if I were to add to
that the matrix A times vector

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,620
C1, A times the column vector
C2-- these are just the

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,940
different columns of this
matrix-- and we just then have

86
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,840
the matrix A times the
column vector Cn.

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
These represent these terms.

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,870
So clearly if I add these two
matrices, I just add the

89
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,810
corresponding column vectors
and I'll get

90
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,500
this matrix up here.

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,490
But what is this equal to?

92
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,780
This right here, by definition,
this is the matrix

93
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,870
A times the matrix B.

94
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,070
The definition of matrix
products is you take the first

95
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,550
matrix and multiply times
the column vectors

96
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,030
of the second matrix.

97
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,390
And by the same argument, I
guess you could say, this is

98
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,230
equivalent to A times C.

99
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,250
And all of this-- remember we
just had a bunch of equal

100
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,380
signs-- is equal to
A times B plus C.

101
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,080
So now we can say definitively
that as long as the products

102
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,340
are well defined and the sums
are well difined, so they all

103
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,090
have to have the correct
dimensions, that A times B

104
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:49,100
plus C is equal to AB plus AC.

105
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,910
So matrix products do exhibit
the distributive property, at

106
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,350
least in this direction.

107
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,550
And I say that because remember
matrix products are

108
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,490
not commutative.

109
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,400
So we don't know necessarily
that B plus C times A is

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,060
equivalent to that.

111
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,510
In fact, most of the time
these two things are not

112
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,000
equivalent.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,610
So we don't know quite yet
that if we reversed this,

114
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,090
whether it's still going
to exhibit the

115
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,230
distributive property.

116
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,770
So let's try to do that.

117
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,850
And I'll do it a little bit
quicker, because I think you

118
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,162
know the general
argument here.

119
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:25,820
So let's take B plus
C times A.

120
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,700
And I'll just write A as
its column vectors.

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:34,540
A1, A2, all the way to-- A has
m columns if I remember

122
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,540
correctly, right A has
m columns-- so

123
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,550
all the way to Am.

124
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,830
And by the definition of matrix
products, this is going

125
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,570
to be equal to the matrix--
B plus C is

126
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,600
just a matrix, right?

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,450
We can represent it as the
sum of two matrix, but

128
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,840
it is just a matrix.

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,300
So it's B plus C times each of
the column vectors of A.

130
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:09,180
So it's going to be equal to
B plus C times a1, B plus C

131
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:17,440
times a2, all the way to
B plus C times an.

132
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,560
And, once again, it was many
videos ago that I think we

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,380
showed that matrix-vector
products are distributive, so

134
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,750
we can just distribute
this vector

135
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,730
along these two matrices.

136
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,400
And if I haven't proven it
yet, it's actually a very

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,560
straightforward proof to do.

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:44,890
So we could say that this is
equal to Ba1 plus Ca2.

139
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,900
That's the first column.

140
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,790
The second column is B times a2,
plus C times a2, all the

141
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,595
way to B times an,
plus C times an.

142
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,530
And then what is
this equal to?

143
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,720
I'll write it out.

144
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,940
This is equivalent to B times--
this is a1, no this is

145
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:21,020
an a1 right here-- a1, and then
B times a2, all the way

146
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:32,210
to Ban plus the vector C times
a1, C times a2, all the way to

147
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,320
C times an, right?

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,570
This guy represents these terms
right there, and this

149
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,320
guy represents the first
terms in each of

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,640
these column vectors.

151
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,490
And this, by the definition of
matrix products, is just

152
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,370
equivalent to BA, and then this
is just equivalent to CA.

153
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,940
So now we've seen that the
distributive property works

154
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,130
both ways with matrix-vector
products.

155
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:04,840
That B plus C times A is equal
to BA+CA, and that A times B

156
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,170
plus C is equal to AB plus AC.

157
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,250
Now the one thing that you have
to be careful of is that

158
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,470
these two things are not
equivalent [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

159
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,420
We just figured out that this
guy is equal to BA plus CA.

160
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,560
So the distribution works
in both ways.

161
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,160
But when you're dealing with
matrices, it's very important

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,550
to keep your order.

163
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,240
So this is going to be you
have the A second here.

164
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,870
So it is BA plus CA.

165
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,640
You can't say that this is
equal to AB plus AC.

166
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,350
You can't just switch
these up.

167
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,520
Because we've shown multiple
times, or we've talked about

168
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,010
it multiple times, that matrix
products are not commutative.

169
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,860
You can't just switch the
order of the products.

170
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,990
But we've at least shown
in this video that the

171
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,050
distributive property
works both ways.
