1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,974
So you're me, and you're in math class.

2
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:03,497
And your teacher's ranting on and on

3
00:00:03,497 --> 00:00:04,723
about this article about whether

4
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:05,948
algebra should be taught in school –

5
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:07,437
as if he doesn't realize that what he's teaching

6
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:08,609
isn't even algebra –

7
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,733
which could have been interesting –

8
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,937
but how to manipulate symbols

9
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:12,725
and some special cases of elementary algebra –

10
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:13,934
which isn't.

11
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,641
And so, instead of learning about

12
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,287
self-consistent systems and logical thought,

13
00:00:17,287 --> 00:00:18,641
you spent all week memorizing

14
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,195
how to graph parabolas.

15
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:23,658
News flash: No one cares about parabolas.

16
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:24,879
Which is why half the class is

17
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,671
playing Angry Birds under their desks.

18
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,390
But, since you don't have a smart phone yet,

19
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,691
you have to resort to a more noble

20
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:31,623
and outdated form of boredom relief –

21
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,269
that is, doodling.

22
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:35,065
And you've invented a game of your own.

23
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:37,061
A doodle game that connects the dots

24
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:39,523
in ways your math curriculum never will –

25
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,639
except instead of connecting to the closest dots

26
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:43,838
to discover the mysterious hidden picture

27
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:46,326
you've got this precise method of skipping over

28
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:48,263
some number of dots and connecting them that way.

29
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:50,161
In the past you've characterized how this works

30
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,912
if your dots are arranged in a circle – say 11 dots –

31
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,066
and connect one to the dot four dots over,

32
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:56,586
you get these awesome stars.

33
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:57,779
And you can either draw the lines

34
00:00:57,779 --> 00:00:58,927
in the order of the dots,

35
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:00,354
or you can just keep going around and

36
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:02,506
maybe it will hit all the dots, or maybe it won't,

37
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,209
depending on how many dots are in your circle,

38
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,353
and how many dots you skip.

39
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,013
But then there are other shapes.

40
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,132
Circles are good friends with sine waves.

41
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,437
And sine waves are good friends with square waves.

42
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,388
And let's admit it, that's pretty cool looking.

43
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,803
In fact, just two simple straight lines of dots

44
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:18,048
connecting the dots from one line to the other

45
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,970
in order somehow gives you

46
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,047
this awesome woven curve shape.

47
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:24,203
Another student is asking the teacher when he's ever

48
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:26,076
going to need to know how to graph a parabola –

49
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,740
even as he hides his multi-million dollar enterprise

50
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,623
of a parabola graphing game under his desk.

51
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:32,900
If your teacher thought about it,

52
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,082
he would probably think shooting birds at things

53
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,030
is a great reason to learn about parabolas

54
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,609
because he's come to understand that

55
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,068
education is about money and prestige and

56
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,928
not about becoming a better human able to do great things.

57
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,949
You yourself haven't done anything really great yet

58
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,027
but you figure the path to your future greatness

59
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,967
lies more in inventing awesome new connect-the-dot arrangements

60
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,612
than in graphing parabolas or shooting birds at things.

61
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,333
And that's when you begin to worry.

62
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,821
What if this cool liney curvey thing you drew

63
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,064
approximates a parabola?

64
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:00,842
As if your teacher doesn't realize

65
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:02,339
everyone has their phones under their desks,

66
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,743
but he's underpaid and overworked and

67
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:05,878
his whole word runs on plausible deniability,

68
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:08,244
so he shouts state-mandated, pass the test,

69
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,870
teach-to-the-middle nonsense at students

70
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,109
who are not at all fooled

71
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:13,438
by his false enthusiasm or false mathematics and

72
00:02:13,438 --> 00:02:14,582
he pretends he's teaching algebra and

73
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:16,441
the students pretend to be taught algebra and

74
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:17,968
everyone else involved in the system

75
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,085
is too invested to do anything

76
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:20,568
but pretend to believe them both.

77
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,553
You think maybe it's a hyperbola,

78
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:24,132
which is similar to the parabola

79
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:25,893
in that they are both conic sections.

80
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:28,556
A hyperbola is a nice vertical slice of cone,

81
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,496
the cone itself being just like a line swirled around in a circle,

82
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:34,754
which is why the cone is like two cones radiating both ways;

83
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,257
the lovely hyperbola insecting both parts.

84
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,317
Two perfect curves, looking disconnected when seen alone

85
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:42,730
but sharing their common conic heritage.

86
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,712
While the boring old parabola is a slice taken at an angle

87
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,845
completely meant to miss the top part of the cone and

88
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:50,677
to miss wrapping around the bottom like an ellipse would.

89
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:53,124
And it's such a special, specific case of conic section

90
00:02:53,124 --> 00:02:54,905
that all parabolas are exactly the same,

91
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:57,147
just bigger or smaller or moved around.

92
00:02:57,147 --> 00:03:00,286
Your teacher could just as well hand you parabolas already drawn

93
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,305
and have you draw coordinate grids on parabolas

94
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,191
rather than parabolas on coordinate grids.

95
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,279
And it's stupid, and you hate it,

96
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,522
and you don't wanna learn to graph them,

97
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,259
even if it means not making a billion dollars

98
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,921
from a game about shooting birds at things.

99
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,711
Meanwhile anyone who actually learns how to think mathematically

100
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:17,264
can then learn to graph a parabola or anything else

101
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,807
they need in like five minutes.

102
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,592
But teaching how to think is an individualized process

103
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,711
that gives power and responsibility to individuals

104
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,387
while teaching what to think can be done

105
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,725
with one-size-fits-all bullet points and check-boxes

106
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,669
and our culture of excuses demands that we do the latter,

107
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,766
keeping ourselves placated in the comforting structure

108
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,730
of tautology and clear expectations.

109
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,215
Algebra has become a check-box subject and

110
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:40,295
mathematics weeps alone in the top of the ivory tower prison

111
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,541
to which she has been condemned.

112
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,272
But you're not interested in check-boxes;

113
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:46,721
you're interested in dots, and lines that connect them.

114
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,578
Or maybe you could connect them with semicircles,

115
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:51,318
to give visual structure to lines that would otherwise overlap.

116
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,854
Or you could say one dot is the center of a circle and

117
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,364
another defines a radius and draw the entire circle

118
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,770
and do things that way.

119
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,611
You could make rules about how every dot

120
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,757
is the center of a circle with its neighbor being the radius,

121
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:04,448
or say one dot stays the center of all circles,

122
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:06,632
and all of the others define radii.

123
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,389
But then you just get concentric circles,

124
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:09,945
which I suppose should have been obvious.

125
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,773
But what if you did it the other way around and

126
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:14,034
said one dot always stays on the circle and

127
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,317
all the other dots are centers, like this.

128
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:17,680
Looks more promising.

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,403
So you try putting all the dots in a circle and

130
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:20,960
using them as circle centers and

131
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,408
choose just one dot for the circles to go through and

132
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:26,214
you get this awesome shape that looks kind of like a heart.

133
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,504
So let's call it, oh I don't know, a cardioid.

134
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,191
Which happens to be the same curve that you get

135
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,331
when parallel lines like rays of light reflect off a circle

136
00:04:33,331 --> 00:04:35,823
the same heart of sunshine in a cup.

137
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,145
Or maybe instead of circle centers

138
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,437
you could have points all on the curve of a circle,

139
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:42,173
which means you need three points to define a circle,

140
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:45,404
maybe just a point and its two closest neighbors to start with.

141
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,576
And of course, any collection of circles is two-colorable,

142
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,660
which means you can contrast light and dark colors

143
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,775
for a classy color scheme.

144
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,728
Or maybe you could throw down some random points

145
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:54,951
to make all possible circles.

146
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,344
Only that would be a lot of circles,

147
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,708
so you choose just ones you like.

148
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,483
And then, against your will, you begin to wonder

149
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,395
how many points it takes to define the boring old parabola.

150
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:04,578
Because parabolas are actually a lot like circles in that

151
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,852
both are like extreme ellipses,

152
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,964
because a circle is like taking one focus of an ellipse

153
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,852
and putting the other focus zero distance away.

154
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:14,299
And a parabola is like an ellipse where

155
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,173
one focus is infinity distance away.

156
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,009
Which is why everyone lies to you and says

157
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,486
throwing balls or shooting birds is all about parabolas

158
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,267
when really it's about ellipses

159
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,046
because the earth is a sphere and

160
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:25,779
gravity doesn't actually go straight down.

161
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,747
And the other focus of the elliptical orbit of

162
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:30,223
your thrown object of choice may be very far away,

163
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:33,517
but very far away is a great bit closer than infinity.

164
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:34,850
So let's not fool ourselves.

165
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,901
You can't look at everything that seems kind of parabolic

166
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,201
and call it a parabola.

167
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,708
Sure, if you connect two dots with a hanging string or chain,

168
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,542
it looks parabolic, and so do structurally strong arches,

169
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,938
but they're actually catenary arches and

170
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,408
maybe you can't tell by sight,

171
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:49,508
but if you're an architect you'd better know the difference.

172
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,119
Though caternarys are quite related to parabolas,

173
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:52,679
you get them by rolling around a parabola

174
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,747
and tracing the focus

175
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,151
which makes them a cousin of the ellipse and

176
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:57,435
even a hyperbola is like an ellipse that got turned inside out

177
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,105
or whose focus went through infinity and

178
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,912
came out the other side or something.

179
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,406
And of course parabolas and hyperbolas and ellipses

180
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,081
are all conic sections which mean

181
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,932
they all come from a line that got spun around.

182
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,053
And a line is just what happens

183
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,275
when a couple dots get connected.

184
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,678
Or maybe what happens when your circle is so big that,

185
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:13,815
like the extreme ellipse that becomes a parabola,

186
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,063
the extreme circle is broken at infinity and

187
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,044
becomes a line before getting larger than infinitely big

188
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:20,638
which brings it back to the other side.

189
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:23,330
This linear circle, the infinite in-between.

190
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,083
Or maybe a line is what happens

191
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,092
when you roll around a circle and trace the focus.

192
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:30,730
Or rather the 2 foci, which are zero distance apart, in ellipse terms.

193
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,280
Which makes you wonder what you get

194
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,692
when you roll around an ellipse and trace the foci.

195
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,501
In fact, there's lots of great shapes

196
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:38,617
you can get by rolling around shapes on other shapes,

197
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:41,416
like if you roll a circle around a circle and trace the focus,

198
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,848
you get just another circle.

199
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,596
But, if you trace a point on the edge,

200
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,898
you get our awesome friend the cardioid again.

201
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:49,209
So now it's related to circles in three ways ,

202
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,326
which means it's a close cousin of the ellipse

203
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,886
and a second cousin to the infinite ellipse or, parabola.

204
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:56,102
Except, not just that, if you take a parabola and

205
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:57,631
invert it around the unit circle, reversing inside and outside,

206
00:06:57,631 --> 00:07:01,772
one half becomes two, one hundred becomes a hundredth,

207
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:03,818
one stays one, infinity becomes zero,

208
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,944
you get once again, the cardioid.

209
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:09,699
The cardioid is the anti-parabola which is good

210
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,822
because parabolas make you sad but you heart cardioids.

211
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:14,242
And of course, any time you want to

212
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:16,016
connect two dots on a piece of paper,

213
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,660
instead of drawing the line you could fold the line.

214
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,546
Here's the thing about connecting dots.

215
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:22,543
You can have all the steps laid out for you,

216
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:25,498
taking whatever next step is easiest and closest

217
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:27,769
and be sure of what you're getting the whole time.

218
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,968
This way is safe and comfortable.

219
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,145
Or, you can try new ways of connecting dots

220
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:33,643
and not know what you're going to get.

221
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:36,430
Maybe it will be something great, maybe it will fail.

222
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,179
And when it fails it will be your fault.

223
00:07:38,179 --> 00:07:40,495
You can't blame anyone else, not mathematics

224
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:41,983
or the system or the check-boxes.

225
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:45,955
But if I am to have faults I would rather they be my own.
