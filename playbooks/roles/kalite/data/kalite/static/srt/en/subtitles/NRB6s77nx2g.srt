1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,840
All right, problem 79.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,060
What is the domain of
the function shown

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,920
on the graph below?

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,610
That sounds like fancy word.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,380
But a function is just a rule.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,550
It's just a rule that
maps from one set

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,690
of numbers to another.

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,510
And the set of numbers that it
maps from is the domain.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,210
And the set of numbers that
it maps to is the range.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,080
So if this is the set of numbers
of the domain, this is

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,310
set of numbers of the range, the
function tells us how do

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,090
we get from this number, some
place in domain, to that

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,470
number, some place
in the range.

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,180
So in general, the domain is all
the numbers for which this

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,900
mapping, or this function,
is defined.

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:47,000
   

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,840
OK, so let's see, so the
domain is where is this

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,090
function defined?

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,940
   

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,440
And in general, when you plot it
on the xy-axis, the domain

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,710
is all of the x values that
you're defined over and the

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,100
range is all the y values.

24
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,400
So the function is a mapping
from x to y.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,700
So let's see where it's defined
when x is equal to 4.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,030
It tells us we're mapping from
x is equal to 4 to y is equal

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,600
to negative 1.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,710
So it's defined for x is equal
to 4, for x is equal to 5, for

29
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,710
x is equal to 2, and it's
defined for x is equal to 1.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,360
So it's defined for all
of those numbers.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,320
That's the domain.

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,590
This function is not defined.

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,540
We don't know what happens when
x is equal to minus 2.

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,800
It's not defined.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,590
It doesn't tell us what
y equals here.

36
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,300
So these are the only
numbers for which

37
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,330
this function is defined.

38
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,290
It tells us that 4 maps to
negative 1, that 5 maps to

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:50,850
negative 2, that 2 maps
to minus 5, and that 1

40
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,800
maps to minus 4.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,920
That's all it tells us.

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,245
And this is actually
the range.

43
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:57,830
   

44
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,080
And that's the domain.

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,840
   

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,530
So let's see, 4, 5, 2, 1.

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,910
This is the domain.

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,919
That's the set of all
numbers for which

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,980
this function is defined.

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,580
This minus 1, 2, 5, and 4.

51
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,590
This is the range right here.

52
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,470
Choice B is the range.

53
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,120
All right.

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,062
I think we're on the
last problem.

55
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,990
This is going to be a lot
of cutting and pasting.

56
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,232
I don't know if it's
going to fit.

57
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:29,210
I have to shrink it.

58
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,876
OK, they say which of the
following is not a function?

59
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,126
That's fascinating.

60
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:35,690
   

61
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,410
OK, I copied it.

62
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,240
And now I have pasted it.

63
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,860
And it did all barely
fit on this page.

64
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,780
So which is not a function?

65
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,720
And remember, what I said
in the beginning.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,600
I don't have space below here.

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,340
Let's think about what a
function is and then we could

68
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,850
look at the graph.

69
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,760
So a function is a mapping
from one set to another.

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,320
From set A to set B.

71
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,470
Where A is the domain
and B is the range.

72
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,300
And this is important thing to
realize about a function.

73
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,460
So if this is set A, and if this
is set B, that for any

74
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,590
value in set A, it only maps
to one value in set B.

75
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,900
You cannot have this.

76
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,790
You can't have one value in set
A going to this value and

77
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,040
going to another value.

78
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,640
   

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,010
So that would not make
it a function.

80
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,590
If we say x is the domain, if
this is the set of all values

81
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,960
we can put into x, and this all
the set of values that can

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,600
go into y or that can be y,
then one value of x can't

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,210
produce two values of y.

84
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,260
You can have it the
other way around.

85
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,500
You could have two different
values of x producing the same

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,960
value of y.

87
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,070
And we'll think about
what that is.

88
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,490
That's completely valid.

89
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,680
You could have two numbers.

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,650
When x is equal to 2 and x is
equal to 7, you can still have

91
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,640
y equaling the same thing.

92
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,700
Say this is x is equal to 5.

93
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,280
X is equal to 5 could
be y is equal to 7.

94
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,630
Or x is equal to 5 could
be y is equal to 8.

95
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,360
We don't know that.

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,860
So let's see.

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,100
Let's think about how we can
visually think about this.

98
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,640
   

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,800
For every value of x, we only
have one definition for y.

100
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,010
And people often call that the
vertical line test. At no

101
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,460
point on this graph can I draw
a vertical line and it

102
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,580
intersects it twice.

103
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,210
If a vertical intersects it
twice, that means for a given

104
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,800
value of x, this function
defines two different y's.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,890
Not going to happen.

106
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,490
Now this function does
for any given y have

107
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,890
two different x's.

108
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,930
Like that point and
that point.

109
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:40,810
That's OK.

110
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,850
That's completely fine.

111
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,680
So for example, when x is equal
to minus 1.5 and x is

112
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,730
equal to 3, they point
to the same number.

113
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:56,280
   

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,490
That's completely OK.

115
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,990
As long as one of these
doesn't point to

116
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,390
two separate numbers.

117
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,290
So that magenta is what that
first graph is doing.

118
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,330
Same thing here, for any
given y we can have two

119
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,040
x's pointing to it.

120
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,740
And they're just fine.

121
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,200
That's completely fine
for a function.

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,726
Now, we talk about function
inverses, well I don't want to

123
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:17,730
get too complicated.

124
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,460
That's completely fine.

125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,200
If we do the vertical line test,
at no point can we draw

126
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,020
vertical line and get, for any
given x, two separate y's.

127
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,760
Same thing for here.

128
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,080
Actually here, we have a
complete 1:1 mapping.

129
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,560
For any given x,
there's one y.

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,110
I think here it should be clear,
that if I were to draw

131
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:48,560
vertical line, let's say right
there, for x is equal to 1, it

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
has two definitions.

133
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,520
Even better, for x is equal
to 0, y could be

134
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,250
minus 2 or plus 2.

135
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,460
So that's the case
that we said.

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,550
For x is equal to 0, it's
pointing to plus 2 and it's

137
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,500
pointing to minus 2.

138
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,470
It's pointing to two different
values which you cannot have

139
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,070
in a function.

140
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,310
For a function, for any
given x, you can only

141
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,650
define one y value.

142
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,230
So this relation is
not a function.

143
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,430
D.

144
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,790
Next question.

145
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,400
I think this is the last.
It's a page on its own.

146
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, that was the
last question.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,320
Did I skip a problem?

148
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,560
See that was 80.

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,190
That's it.

150
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,030
We're all done.

151
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,180
All right, see you soon.

152
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,400
