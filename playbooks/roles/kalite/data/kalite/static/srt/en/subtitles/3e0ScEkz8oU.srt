1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,280
Let's think about what might
happen if we had a solution of

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,640
this molecule and water and
how they might react.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,920
And just as a bit of review
on naming, let's

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,640
just name this molecule.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,540
The longest chain, let's see,
we have one, two, three

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,330
carbons, so it is going
to be a prop-.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,340
It's an alkane, All
single bonds, so

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,590
it's going to be propane.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,530
   

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,450
And then this is our
longest chain right

12
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,720
here, one, two, three.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,770
We have this methyl group off of
the number two carbon, and

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,370
we also have the bromo group off
of the number two carbon.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,410
So it's going to be 2-bromo.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,430
let me write this here.

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,680
It's going to be
2-bromo-2-methyl.

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,840
   

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,990
let me write that a
little bit neater.

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,460
I'll need more space
to the left.

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:02,060
This is going to be
2-bromo-2-methyl-- for this

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,989
methyl group off the number
two carbon-- propane.

23
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:08,430
So let's think about how it
might react with just water.

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,360
Now, in this example, water is
going to be our nucleophile.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It has some electrons already
over there, but even more,

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,260
it's very electronegative,
which we've

27
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,240
seen multiple times.

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,010
So it's hogging electrons
from the hydrogen.

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,120
It's not as strong of a
nucleophile as the hydroxide

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,520
anion that we saw in the Sn2
reaction, but it is a

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,140
nucleophile.

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,310
This is actually a
weak nucleophile.

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,830
This right here is a
weak nucleophile.

34
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,750
It wouldn't mind maybe being
attracted to a nucleus because

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,720
it has extra negative charge.

36
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,050
It has a partial negative charge
on this side of the

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,560
oxygen, because it's hogging
hydrogen's electrons.

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,580
You have partial positive
charges on these sides.

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,490
But it's not as strong as a
hydroxide, which has an actual

40
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,160
negative charge, not just a
partial negative charge, and

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,520
really wants to offload
electrons, or is

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
attracted to a nucleus.

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,970
So this is a weak nucleophile.

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,030
   

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,660
And we're going to talk more
about-- we're going to see one

46
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,949
type of reaction in this video,
and we're going to talk

47
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,210
more in several videos about
when this type of reaction

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,560
versus an Sn2 type of reaction
might occur.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,040
So let's look at this
right here.

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,040
We have a bromine
right over here.

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,890
We know that bromine is very
electronegative, and that it

52
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:34,040
is somewhat stable when it
has a negative charge.

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,910
At least it'll have eight
valence electrons, which makes

54
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,100
it feel relatively good,
although charge is never a

55
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,810
super stable situation.

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,980
So maybe, and I'm not going to
say that the reaction will go

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,280
super fast in this direction,
but maybe bromine will take

58
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,590
away the electron that
it has from carbon.

59
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,700
It was already hogging
it a little bit.

60
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
It is already more
electronegative.

61
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,300
Let me draw all of bromine's
valence electrons.

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,220
So it has that one that's on
that side with the carbon.

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,560
Let me draw the carbon
electron on the other

64
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,620
side of that bond.

65
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,010
And then it has six other
valence electrons.

66
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:19,570
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven

67
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,050
total valence electrons.

68
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,030
So maybe we can imagine a
situation where bromine takes

69
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,330
this carbon's electron
altogether.

70
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,070
So let's draw that out.

71
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,690
So it literally will take this
electron altogether.

72
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,420
   

73
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,600
And once again, I said this
isn't going to be the super

74
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,850
fast direction, but
it could happen.

75
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,230
And so this reaction won't
necessarily go super fast.

76
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,320
It'll kind of be
in equilibrium.

77
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,160
So if that were to happen, we'd
be in equilibrium with

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,390
this situation.

79
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,550
So let me draw my original.

80
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,940
So I have my carbon.

81
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,180
I have that CH3 group
behind it.

82
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,180
I have the CH3 group
in front of it.

83
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,160
I have the CH3 above it.

84
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,885
But now the bromine has left.

85
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,620
   

86
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,740
It's no longer bonded.

87
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,950
And it has its original seven
valence electrons: one, two,

88
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,019
three, four, five, six, seven.

89
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,155
This one right here was
originally bonded with the

90
00:04:20,155 --> 00:04:23,410
electron from carbon, but now
bromine has taken that orange

91
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,680
electron altogether.

92
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,290
   

93
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,680
It has a negative charge.

94
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,940
The carbon has lost that orange
electron and so it has

95
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,300
a positive charge.

96
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,540
Now, it could be interesting if
oxygen comes into the mix.

97
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,520
   

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Sorry, if water comes
into the mix.

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,860
So let me draw the water
molecule right here.

100
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,040
   

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,390
It is a weak nucleophile,
but this guy

102
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,090
really wants an electron.

103
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,710
He has a positive charge.

104
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,550
It is a tertiary carbocation,
so it's reasonably stable.

105
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,950
That's actually one
of the reasons why

106
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,750
this can even happen.

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:14,400
If this was a primary or if it
was connected to no other

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
carbons, then it would be very
hard for this thing to just

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,760
turn into a carbocation.

110
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,990
But because it's tertiary, it's
somewhat stable, but it

111
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,620
doesn't like to have that
positive charge.

112
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,970
It really wants an electron.

113
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,970
So you could now imagine that
this oxygen-- oh, sorry, this

114
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,930
water-- let me be careful.

115
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,470
This water will give one
of its electrons.

116
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,710
So maybe that electron
right there will be

117
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,870
given to the carbon.

118
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,960
You could view it that this is
the nucleophile and it's being

119
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
attracted to carbon's
positive nucleus.

120
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
So then what will happen?

121
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,745
And once you're in this state,
this reaction actually will

122
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:52,340
occur much faster than
this one right here.

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,710
This is actually a reasonably
stable situation.

124
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,210
That's why I drew
the equilibrium.

125
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,760
But now this will actually
be a faster reaction.

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,440
So I'll just draw
an arrow here.

127
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,380
   

128
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,850
And then it will
look like this.

129
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,350
So we have our original carbon,
the original molecule.

130
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,800
That's the thing that's
behind it, CH3.

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,660
We have another CH3
in front of it.

132
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,540
And now, this water
is attached to it.

133
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,070
So let me draw the oxygen
and the two hydrogens.

134
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,940
Oxygen had these
two electrons.

135
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,760
It had another electron here.

136
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,030
That's that one right
over there.

137
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,440
Let me do it in this color.

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,270
So this has this
electron here.

139
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,790
But its pair, the thing that it
was in a pair with, is now

140
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,040
given to the carbon.

141
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,220
   

142
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,470
And they will be bonded.

143
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,740
   

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,780
These two guys are
still paired up.

145
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,690
Now, since oxygen-- this water
had a neutral charge.

146
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,410
But now it has given away one
of its electrons, so now the

147
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,130
water itself will have a
positive charge, or I guess

148
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,110
this water group, or you
can say it's kind of an

149
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,440
oxonium group now.

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,980
It has a positive charge.

151
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,140
And so the last thing that might
happen is maybe another

152
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,370
water molecule, or actually it
could even be the bromine,

153
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,630
comes along and grabs one of the
hydrogen protons so that

154
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,350
this electron can be taken
back by this oxygen.

155
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,650
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

156
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,690
So maybe you could imagine
another water molecule.

157
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,050
There's gazillions of them.

158
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,180
Let me draw another water
molecule here.

159
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,970
   

160
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,970
We have another water
molecule right here.

161
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,110
And this would happen
simultaneously.

162
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,520
This might give one of his
electrons to, say, that

163
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,790
hydrogen right there.

164
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,420
And if that happens
simultaneously, this electron

165
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,110
that this hydrogen had could be
given back to this original

166
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,600
oxygen right here.

167
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,320
So that oxygen will take
back that electron.

168
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,870
And when that reaction happens,
we will be left

169
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,360
with-- let me draw our
original structure.

170
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,220
So we have the CH3 behind us.

171
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,170
We have the CH3 in
front of us.

172
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,310
We have the CH3 above this
carbon that's doing all the

173
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,440
reacting, and then it is bonded
to an oxygen, which is

174
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,880
bonded to a hydrogen, to only
this hydrogen, because it took

175
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,850
back the electron from
that hydrogen right

176
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,950
there, just like that.

177
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,210
You also have the bromine with
its negative charge, and it

178
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,049
has eight valence
electrons now.

179
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,679
And then, of course, you
have an extra oxonium.

180
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,690
So this oxygen right
here gave this

181
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,360
electron to this hydrogen.

182
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,280
So now it will be bonded
to that hydrogen.

183
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,370
And if you wanted to draw all
of the valence electrons on

184
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,470
this oxygen right here, it
would look like this.

185
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,550
So you have these two,
so one, two.

186
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,110
You have the one with
that three that's

187
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,130
bonded with that carbon.

188
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,260
Let me do that in a
different color.

189
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,390
So you have this one is
the same thing as

190
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,710
that valence electron.

191
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,030
It has the one bonded
with the hydrogen.

192
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,420
Let me make the bond clear.

193
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,920
   

194
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,530
It has a bond here with
the hydrogen.

195
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,610
So that's this hydrogen
bond right here, this

196
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,580
bond with the hydrogen.

197
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,620
I don't want to call
it a hydrogen bond.

198
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,990
You get the idea.

199
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,890
It has that valence electron
right there on

200
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,150
that end of the bond.

201
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,230
And then it had this
valence electron.

202
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,800
It had this one right
here at this end of

203
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,720
this bond with hydrogen.

204
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,090
That was just like that.

205
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,580
And then it took the other
electron from the hydrogen,

206
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,810
and so it's right there.

207
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,140
So once again, it still has
six valence electrons.

208
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,540
It is now a neutral
oxygen: one, two,

209
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,780
three, four, five, six.

210
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,760
So we were able to react this
2-bromo-2-methylpropane with

211
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,480
water, which is a weak
nucleophile.

212
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,950
We'll talk more about strong
and weak nucleophiles.

213
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,390
And we got to-- what is this
thing right over here?

214
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,220
Our longest chain is
one, two, three.

215
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,630
It's still prop-.

216
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,240
We're going to have
prop- as a prefix.

217
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,960
And I actually haven't
taught you this.

218
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:18,450
But since we have an OH group,
this is an alcohol.

219
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:24,080
And the way you name alcohols
is the suffix is -anol.

220
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,570
So we would call this, this is
prop-, and sometimes they'll

221
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,070
just say propanol, but since
we want to specify which

222
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,360
carbon we're on, this is the
one, two, three carbon.

223
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,610
This is propan-2-ol.

224
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,020
   

225
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,590
And, of course, we also
have a methyl

226
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,690
group on the two carbon.

227
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,940
So it's 2-methylpropan-2-ol.

228
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,710
   

229
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,040
Now, this whole reaction that I
just showed you is called an

230
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,660
Sn1 reaction.

231
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,570
And you might have a gut
sense of why it's

232
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,030
Sn1 instead of Sn2.

233
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,950
So let me write it down.

234
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,860
It's Sn1 reaction.

235
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,035
The S still stands
for substitution.

236
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:13,290
   

237
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:21,260
The n still stands for
nucleophilic, right?

238
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,320
We had a weak nucleophile in
the water molecule, so it

239
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,340
substituted.

240
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,590
Now, the 1 stands for the fact
that the slowest-- the

241
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,160
rate-determining step in this
mechanism, the one that is

242
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,320
going to happen the
slowest. That only

243
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,080
involves one of the reactants.

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,550
This right here was the
rate-determining step, the

245
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,470
bromine taking the electron
away from the carbon.

246
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,960
It did not involve this
water at all.

247
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,440
It did not involve both the
reactants like we saw in the

248
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,990
Sn2 reaction.

249
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,370
Since it only involves
this one reactant,

250
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,040
it is an Sn1 reaction.

251
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,134
