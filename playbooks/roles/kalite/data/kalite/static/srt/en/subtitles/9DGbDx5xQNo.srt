1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,640
We all hear the unemployment
rate quoted all the time and

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,680
it's obviously a very important
economic indicator.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,210
But what I want to do in this
video is dig a little bit

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,050
deeper, and actually figure
out how it's calculated.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,110
I'm going to draw a big
diagram right here.

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,710
Let's say that that big circle
represents the entire U.S.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,960
population.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,430
   

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,140
I just looked it up on Google.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,320
It's 304 million people,
give or take a couple.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,200
And then there's going to be a
subset-- that's everybody,

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,510
that includes my 10
month old son.

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,940
So obviously, if we're talking
about unemployment, he at

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,760
least shouldn't be relevant,
not just yet.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,100
So there's a subset of people
that the Bureau Of Labor

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,310
Statistics considers at
least kind of old

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,170
enough to care about.

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:55,080
So this is 16 years and older.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,960
And I'd looked that
up as of November.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,820
That was about 237 million
people in the U.S.

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,090
But then there's a subset of
that, because not everyone 16

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,170
years and older is necessarily
employable or wants to work.

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,510
They might be in school,
or in the military, or

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,850
they might be retired.

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,210
So they look for a subset of the
people old enough to work,

27
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,040
and they call that
the labor force.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,120
I'll do the labor
force in pink.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,950
I never use that color.

30
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,532
I'll do it in green.

31
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:30,690
So that right there in green
is the labor force.

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,710
   

33
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,750
And, as of November, if those
numbers I just saw are right,

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,500
are 154 million people.

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,290
And then there's some subset
of the labor force that the

36
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,620
Bureau Of Labor Statistics
considers unemployed.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,620
I'll do it in orange.

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,790
And the latest numbers
are about 15 million.

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,040
That's unemployed.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,960
   

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,920
So the very simple way that they
actually calculate the

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
number-- but we'll see there's
a little bit more nuance than

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,770
what the formula might speak
to at first-- is that the

44
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:23,550
unemployment rate, this color,
is equal to the number of

45
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,170
unemployed.

46
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,790
I'll do it in that same
orange color.

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,390
So unemployed divided
by the labor force.

48
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,010
   

49
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:47,380
And the labor force is made up
of the unemployed plus, as you

50
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,630
would imagine, the employed.

51
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,330
   

52
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,590
So in this example, to figure
out the unemployment rate,

53
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,320
there were 15 million who were
unemployed, so they put 15

54
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,540
million up there in the
numerator, and then the

55
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,010
denominator would be this
entire labor force.

56
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,340
So it would be the 15 million
who were unemployed and then

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,350
whatever 154 minus 15 is.

58
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,700
What is that?

59
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,875
It's 139 million who are
gainfully employed.

60
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,500
   

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,270
This number right here is 139.

62
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,670
This number right here is 15.

63
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,830
You add them together you
get the labor force.

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,010
That's 154 million people.

65
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,410
Now that seems straightforward
enough.

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,260
I think if you do the math here,
you get something that's

67
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,810
close to 10%.

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,260
But what I want to focus on is
the definitions of unemployed

69
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,430
and the labor force, because
they're a little different, at

70
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,980
least from my point of view,
than how the term is used.

71
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,480
According to the Bureau Of Labor
Statistics, unemployed

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,600
is someone who essentially
doesn't have a

73
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,980
job but wants one.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,540
And the way they measure whether
you want to have a job

75
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:07,690
is, you've looked for a job
in the past four weeks.

76
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,760
So if I was trying to find a
job, sending my resume around,

77
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,079
and then I just got fatigue from
interviewing and I took

78
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,529
five weeks off, I would not
be considered unemployed.

79
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,870
And that's an important
thing to think about.

80
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,920
If the economy were to be so
bad-- Let's say in week one I

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,390
am part of the unemployed.

82
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,710
I don't have a job but I'm
looking for a job.

83
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,780
So I'm sitting right there and
I am part of the labor force.

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,450
I'm not employed but I'm
unemployed looking for a job.

85
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,860
But let's say after
several weeks of

86
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,980
this, I just get tired.

87
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,150
I'm like, you know what, I'm
just going to take a few

88
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,760
months off.

89
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,040
I'm not even going to look for
a job-- things are so bad--

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,350
until things get better.

91
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,800
What happens is that I go and
join a pool of people outside

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
of the labor force.

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,790
So instead of being part of the
labor force, or part of

94
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,450
this employed group right here,
if I take more than a

95
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,270
four week-- If I take
essentially four and a half

96
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,300
weeks where I don't look for a
job, I go into a new bucket

97
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,930
called marginally attached
workers.

98
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,070
   

99
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,650
And that's part of the people
who aren't in the labor force.

100
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,970
All of a sudden I'm not
in the labor force.

101
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,120
So just like that you're taking
me out of the numerator

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,700
and you're also taking me
out of the denominator.

103
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,422
So that actually could improve
the unemployment rate.

104
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,665
I want to make this very clear
because this is a non

105
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,690
intuitive idea.

106
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,570
That the economy could be so
bad, that because I jump out

107
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,970
of the labor pool, the
unemployment rate could

108
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,230
actually improve.

109
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,130
Let me do this with very simple
numbers just to make it

110
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,550
a little bit clear.

111
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,360
Let's imagine a world where the
entire potential working

112
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,560
adult population has
three people in it.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,810
So there's three adults.

114
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,100
   

115
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,530
People old enough to work.

116
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,780
And let's say the subset of that
adult population, that we

117
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,740
right now consider part of the
labor force, let's say there's

118
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,550
two people.

119
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,810
Obviously these are extreme
numbers, but I think it'll

120
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,760
show you how the math
can work out.

121
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,020
Now let's say, out of those two
people in the labor force,

122
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,270
one of them is unemployed.

123
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:25,320
   

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,510
Obviously if there's two people
in the labor force, one

125
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,620
is unemployed, then the other
person is employed.

126
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,150
And then there's one more adult
out there who's maybe in

127
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,840
school or is a homemaker or
maybe a retiree, but we don't

128
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,250
know exactly what they are.

129
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,610
And let's say I'm this
unemployed person right here.

130
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,510
   

131
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,100
Let's say I keep looking for a
job but at some point I've

132
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,220
gotten rejected so much, and
the news I hear is so dire,

133
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,440
that I just decide to take a
break, or take some rest, or I

134
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,430
just become depressed about my
lot in life and I just stop

135
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,440
looking for a job.

136
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,260
I become discouraged.

137
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,910
What happens, according to the
Bureau Of Labor Statistics, is

138
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,130
I am no longer part--
so this is before.

139
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,595
This is while I'm trying.

140
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,520
   

141
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,720
But if I give up.

142
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,660
Essentially, if I become so
discouraged that I stop

143
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,130
looking for work for more than
four weeks, then the new way

144
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,200
that we would have to draw that
diagram out-- our little

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,470
three person country
is, we would still

146
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,720
have the three adults.

147
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,390
   

148
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,930
But now, instead of being
unemployed since I've given

149
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,090
up, I'm now not part
of the labor force.

150
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,900
Because I'm not looking
for work.

151
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,800
So now the entire labor force
is just going to be that one

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,260
dude with the job.

153
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,860
So one person.

154
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,900
And there'll be no
unemployment.

155
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,830
Because there's no-one in
the labor force who

156
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,710
doesn't have a job.

157
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,330
I would have jumped into
this bucket right here.

158
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,080
I would now be out here.

159
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,300
This is me.

160
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,010
Well, I meant to draw that as
a set but I turned it into a

161
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,020
frowny face.

162
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,810
But this is me right here.

163
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,590
So what actually happened
over here?

164
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,000
I had a 50% unemployment rate.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,820
1 divided by 2.

166
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,680
1 divided by the entire
labor force.

167
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,310
That's 50% unemployment,
which is obviously

168
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,770
another extreme number.

169
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,410
But now, in this situation,
because I've dropped out of

170
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,970
the labor force because I was
so discouraged, I now don't

171
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,880
get counted.

172
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,780
So here you have 0%
unemployment.

173
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,420
And if you just superficially
looked at the numbers-- and

174
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,929
there are other scenarios you
can think about, where either

175
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,230
the numerator or denominator
changes because people get

176
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,640
encouraged or discouraged or
decide to be a homemaker or go

177
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,780
back to school or come
out of the military,

178
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,840
whatever it might be.

179
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,810
I just want to show you
that something very

180
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,980
non intuitive happened.

181
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,550
Because the economy was
so bad, I jumped out

182
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,700
of the labor force.

183
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,660
And because I jumped out
of the labor force, the

184
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,850
unemployment rate looks
superficially positive.

185
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,840
It went from 50%, in this
example, to 0%.

186
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,770
Obviously in the real world
you're not going to see this

187
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,920
type of extreme behavior because
you have more than

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,670
three people, you have
304 million people.

189
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,160
But what I wanted to do is show
you the nuance of how

190
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,750
this is calculated.

191
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,850
And I don't think anyone is
trying to mislead anyone, but

192
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,450
what is happening is that they
have to draw some threshold of

193
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,280
what it means to be part
of the labor force.

194
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,220
And that's this notion of
looking for a job in the past

195
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,270
four weeks.

196
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,980
Your brother-in-law who's living
in your basement, you

197
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,170
might consider him to be
unemployed, but the Bureau Of

198
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,370
Labor Statistics considers him
to be, if he hasn't looked for

199
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,270
a job in the last four weeks,
discouraged or perhaps

200
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,100
marginally attached.

201
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,243
