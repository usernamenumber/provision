1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:06,043
Regardless of your opinion of how much regulation or how much intervention the government should have

2
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:11,840
in markets and in capitalism generally, I think it's interesting to take a look at the various cycles

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,874
that have happened in the United States, both from a economic point of view and also from a regulatory

4
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:21,305
point of view. And if we start in the late 1800's and at the late 1800's we've had the Civil War, we've

5
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:26,572
had Reconstruction. You actually have a crisis -- kind of a depression after the Civil War, but then

6
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:33,287
after that depression at the end of the 1800's, the United States comes roaring back and it become a

7
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:39,150
major industrialized nation. And part of that industrializing process you have some gentlemen who become

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,219
very,very,very wealthy. You have Cornelius Vanderbilt -- his wealth was in the rail and the steamboats

9
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:54,206
-- John D. Rockefeller, known by some people as the wealthiest man in history. And that may or may not

10
00:00:54,206 --> 00:01:01,093
be the case, but he was definitely the wealthiest man in American history -- Some accounts will say he had

11
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:05,840
1.5 billion dollars -- you might say "Well Hey! I know people who have more than 1.5 billion dollars."

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,354
But if you inflation adjusted the amount of money that John D Rockefeller has

13
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,068
at the turn of century

14
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,707
and comes out to 400 billion to

15
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,102
600 billion dollars so

16
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:21,076
this is a lot of more than anyone we know of at present times

17
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:24,075
You have Andrew Carnegie in the steel business

18
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:29,159
his net worth if you look at present value basis is approximately 300 billion

19
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,185
You have people like J.P.Morgan

20
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:35,502
And although his net worth also huge huge amount

21
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:39,961
But where his powers really in, since he was kind of a in control of the financial world

22
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:41,190
at that time

23
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,386
His financial power was tremendous maybe more

24
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,895
than the type of power that these gentlemen to wield that

25
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:52,360
the amount of power that he and his associates controlled through their various holdings

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,004
Some have said was amounted to the amount of wealth and

27
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,690
all of the U.S. west of the mississippi

28
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,485
So these are hugely powerful, hugely

29
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:06,428
wealthy man. The type of power and wealthy that we actually have not seen since

30
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:14,588
And you can decide what you think of these people

31
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,571
On some level, all of these people were, I'm sure they were good entrepreneurs,

32
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,506
I'm sure they were hard-working, I'm sure they were innovated in their own way

33
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:22,434
But they were also know for, back then, you know , this is a

34
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:30,075
this might be why would have given fuel to someone like Marx would look at people like this and say

35
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:32,354
Look, these people have so much power, Labor has no power comparing to them,

36
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:34,688
Some of the employees and some of these companies,

37
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:39,035
it hard to really say that they are independent human beings,

38
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:41,456
they are almost like slave labors, they live on the campus, they have no rights

39
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:45,889
People are dying while they were working for some of these organizations

40
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:50,956
So you can decide where you will, but the reality is these people were

41
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,987
hugely hugely HUGELY wealthy HUGELY powerful

42
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:59,127
Now you fast forward to the early 1900

43
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,802
and you start having a little bit of a backlash against these,

44
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:05,191
I guess the system in which these type of people can strive

45
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:08,470
And you have Teddy Roosevelt comes to power in 1901

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,575
And one of the things, he is famous for many things,

47
00:03:14,575 --> 00:03:15,859
One of the things he is famous for is being a trust buster

48
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:19,008
And when he talks about Trust, a Trust is really a large corpotation

49
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:23,661
And the idea is that look standard oil, you have a sensory taken control of

50
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,343
the refining in the oil industry in America, you'll become a monopolist

51
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,104
you'll be broken up

52
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:31,335
This is anti competitive, Remember,

53
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:36,137
Capitalism, For the capitalism sake, is maybe not that good of an idea

54
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:38,753
What we want is competition, What we want is innovation,

55
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,570
What we want is incentive

56
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,376
In a few control everything and no one can compete

57
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,020
That's not helping anyone.

58
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,655
So Teddy Roosevelt, he, it didn't happen during his administration

59
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:51,123
But he kinda started the trust rusting porcess

60
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:54,240
And the next administration, in tax administration

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,890
You actually have standard oil being broken up

62
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,106
And get to get an idea of how big standard oil was

63
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:07,672
if you take Exxon, Mobil's, Chevron, Conical and pretty much every other major US oil company

64
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:11,721
put them together, And i not saying that is equivalent of standard oil

65
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,587
That's actually what standard oil was,

66
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:19,024
The standard oil was broken up during the tax administration

67
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,370
It was actually broken up into all of these corporations

68
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,934
And you can look into it more.

69
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,934
So you can imagine how much power someone like that would hold
