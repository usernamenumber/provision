1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,110
Welcome to the presentation
on dividing fractions.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,490
Let's get started.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,640
So before I give you the
intuition-- actually, I might

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,340
do that in a different module--
I'm just going to show you the

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,740
mechanics of how you
divide a fraction.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,740
And it turns out that
it's actually not much

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,030
more difficult than
multiplying fractions.

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,410
If I were to ask you, 1/2
divided by 1/2, whenever you

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,110
divide by a fraction, or
actually, when you divide by

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,960
any number, it's the same thing
as multiplying by its inverse.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,670
So 1/2 divided by 1/2 is
equal to 1/2 times 2/1.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:44,990
We just inverted--
inverse-- the second 1/2.

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,630
And we know from the
multiplication module, 1/2

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,110
times 2/1, well, that's
just equal to 2/2,

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,560
or it's equal to 1.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,020
And that makes sense because,
actually, any number divided

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,750
by itself is equal to 1.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,220
1/2 divided by 1/2 is 1, just
like 5 divided by 5 is 1, just

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,240
like 100 divided by 100 is 1.

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,850
And this isn't a new principal.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,970
Actually, you were
always doing it.

22
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,560
But isn't this also the
same thing as 2 times the

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,210
inverse of 2, which is 1?

24
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,950
I'll show it to you.

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,990
Actually, let me give you a
couple more examples to show

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,340
that dividing fractions really
isn't a new concept, this whole

27
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,840
notion of multiplying
by the inverse.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,540
If I were to tell you
what is 12 divided by 4?

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,650
Well, we know the answer to
this, but I'm going to show

30
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:50,640
you that this is the same
thing as 12 times 1/4.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,230
12/1 times 1/4 4 is
12/4, which is 3.

32
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,480
And 12/4 is really just another
way of writing 12 divided by 4,

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,535
so it's kind of a long way of
getting to the same point.

34
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,990
But I just wanted to show you
that what we're doing in this

35
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,970
module is nothing new than
what we've always been doing

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,320
when we divide by a number.

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,360
Division is the same thing.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,310
Dividing by a number is the
same thing as multiplying by

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,960
the inverse of that number.

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,880
And just as a review, an
inverse, if I have a number

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:28,070
A, the inverse-- inv, short
for inverse-- is 1 over A.

42
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:36,290
So the inverse of 2/3 is 3/2,
or the inverse of 5, because 5

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,670
is the same thing as 5/1,
so the inverse is 1/5.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,475
So let's do some fraction
division problems.

45
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:49,270
What is 2/3 divided by 5/6?

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:05,970
Well, we know that this is the
same thing as 2/3 times 6/5,

47
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,230
and that's equal to 12/15.

48
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,570
We can divide the numerator and
denominator by 3, that's 4/5.

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:22,900
What is 7/8 divided by 1/4?

50
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,520
Well, that's the same
thing as 7/8 times 4/1.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,820
Remember, I just
flipped this 1/4.

52
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,840
Divide by 1/4 is the same
thing as multiplying by 4/1.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,230
That's all you've got to do.

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,990
And then we could use a little
shortcut we learned in the

55
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,480
multiplication module.

56
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,950
8 divided by 4 is 2.

57
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,800
4 divided by 4 is 1.

58
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,450
So that equals 7/2.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,900
Or if you wanted to write that
as a mixed number, this is, of

60
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,200
course, an improper fraction.

61
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
Improper fractions have
a numerator larger

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,830
than the denominator.

63
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,670
If you wanted to write that as
a mixed number, 2 goes into 7

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,680
three times with a remainder
of 1, so that's 3 and a half.

65
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,440
You can write it either way.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,990
I tend to keep it this
way because it's

67
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,800
easier to deal with.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,130
Let's do a ton of more
problems, or at least as many

69
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,830
more as we can do in the
next four or five minutes.

70
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:23,850
What's negative 2/3
divided by 5/2?

71
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,110
Once again, that's the same
thing as minus 2/3-- whoops--

72
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,850
as minus 2/3 times what?

73
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,110
It's times the inverse of
5/2, which is 2/5, and

74
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,630
that equals minus 4/15.

75
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:52,300
What is 3/2 divided by 1/6?

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,850
Well, that's just the same
thing as 3/2 times 6/1,

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,280
I think you might
be getting it now.

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,950
Let's see, let's
do a couple more.

79
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,290
And, of course, you can always
pause, and look at this whole

80
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,420
presentation again, so you can
get confused all over again.

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's see, let's do minus
5/7 divided by 10/3.

82
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,880
Well, this is the same thing
as minus 5/7 times 3/10.

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,420
I just multiplied
by the inverse.

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,120
That's all I keep doing
over and over again.

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,180
Minus 5 times 3.

86
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,610
Minus 15.

87
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,350
7 times 10 is 70.

88
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,900
If we divide the numerator
and the denominator by

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,050
5, we get minus 3/14.

90
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,500
We could have also
just done it here.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,890
We could have done 5, 2,
and we would have gotten

92
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,510
minus 3/14 as well.

93
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,420
Let's do one or two
more problems.

94
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,630
I think you kind of
get it, though.

95
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,600
Let's say 1/2
divided by minus 3.

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,965
Ah-ha!

97
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,940
So what happens when you take a
fraction and you divide it by

98
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,730
a whole number or an integer?

99
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,970
Well, we know any whole number
can be written as a fraction.

100
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,010
This is the same thing as
1/2 divided by minus 3/1.

101
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,870
And dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

102
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,430
by it's inverse.

103
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,150
So the inverse of negative 3/1
is negative 1/3, and this

104
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,200
equals negative 1/6.

105
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,040
Let's do it the other way.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,880
What if I had negative
3 divided by 1/2?

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,500
Same thing.

108
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,370
Negative 3 is the same thing as
minus 3/1 divided by 1/2, which

109
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,940
is the same thing as minus 3/1
times 2/1, which is equal to

110
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,010
minus 6/1, which
equals minus 6.

111
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,810
Now, let me give you a
little bit of intuition

112
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,730
of why this works.

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,240
Let's say I said 2
divided by 1/3.

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,650
Well, we know that this
is equal to 2/1 times

115
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,120
3/1, which equals 6.

116
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,700
So how does 2, 1/3,
and 6 relate?

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,690
Well, let's look
at it this way.

118
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,930
If I had two pieces of pizza.

119
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,660
I have two pieces of pizza.

120
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,520
Here's my two pieces
of pizza right.

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,530
Two right here.

122
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,050
So I have two pieces of pizza,
and I'm going to divide

123
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,080
them into thirds.

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,600
So I'm going to divide
each pizza into a third.

125
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,860
I'll draw the little
Mercedes sign.

126
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,050
So I'm dividing each pizza
into a third, right?

127
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,210
How many pieces do I have?

128
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,925
Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

129
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:04,800
I have 6 pieces.

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,140
So you might want to sit and
ponder that for a little bit,

131
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,850
but I think it might make a
little bit of sense to you.

132
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,190
Let's do one more just
to tire your brain.

133
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:25,750
If I had negative 7/2 divided
by 4/9-- let's pick a negative

134
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,580
4/9-- well, that's the same
thing as minus 7/2 times

135
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,720
minus 9/4, right?

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,950
I just multiplied by the
inverse of negative 4/9.

137
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,220
9 times 7 is equal to--
negative 7 times negative

138
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,800
9 is positive 63,
and 2 times 4 is 8.

139
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,460
Hopefully, I think you have a
good idea of how to divide by

140
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,960
a fraction now, and you can
try out the dividing

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,310
fractions modules.

142
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,890
Have fun!
