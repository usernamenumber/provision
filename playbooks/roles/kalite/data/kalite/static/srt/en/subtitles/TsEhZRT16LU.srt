1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,620
We're asked what is the
equation of line B?

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,750
And they tell us that line A has
an equation y is equal to

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,590
2x plus 11.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,770
And they say that the
line B contains the

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,310
point 6, negative 7.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:18,520
And they tell us lines A and B
are perpendicular, so that

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,680
means that slope of
B must be negative

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,200
inverse of slope of A.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,490
So what we'll do is figure out
the slope of A, then take the

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,690
negative inverse of it.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,000
Then we'll know the slope of B,
then we can use this point

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,210
right here to fill in the
gaps and figure out B's

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,560
y-intercept.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,590
So what's the slope of A?

15
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,020
This is already in
slope-intercept form.

16
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,570
The slope of A is right there,
it's the 2, mx plus b.

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,540
So the slope here
is equal to 2.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,590
So the slope of A is 2.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,860
What is the slope of B?

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,850
So what is B's slope going
to have to be?

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,740
Well, it's perpendicular to
A, so it's going to be the

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,420
negative inverse of this.

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,040
The inverse of two is 1/2.

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,700
The negative inverse of
that is negative 1/2.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,300
So B's slope is negative 1/2.

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,520
So we know that B's equation
has to be y is equal to its

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,290
slope, m times x plus
some y-intercept.

28
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,720
We still don't know what the
y-intercept of B is, but we

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,400
can use this information
to figure it out.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,210
We know that y is equal
to negative 7 when

31
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,480
x is equal to 6.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:48,420
Negative 1/2 times
6 plus b, right?

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,730
I just know that this is on the
point, so this point must

34
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,700
satisfy the equation
of line B.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,420
So let's work out what b must
be-- or what b, the

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,380
y-intercept, this is a lowercase
b, not the line B.

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,320
So we have negative 7 is equal
to-- what's negative

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,650
1/2 half times 6?

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,840
That's not a b there,
that's a 6.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,500
What's negative 1/2 times 6?

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,050
It's negative 3, is equal
to negative 3 plus our

42
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,380
y-intercept.

43
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,880
Let's add 3 to both sides of
this equation, so if we add 3

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,150
to both sides-- I just want to
get rid of this 3 right here--

45
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,800
what do we get?

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,310
The left-hand side, negative
7 plus 3 is negative 4, and

47
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,720
that's going to be equal to--
these guys cancel out-- that's

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,170
equal to b, our y-intercept.

49
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,900
So this right here
is a negative 4.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,980
So the equation of line B is y
is equal to-- its slope is

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,160
a negative inverse of this
character-- so negative 1/2,

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,770
negative 1/2 x.

53
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:56,590
And its y-intercept we just
figured out is negative 4.

54
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,160
And we are done.
