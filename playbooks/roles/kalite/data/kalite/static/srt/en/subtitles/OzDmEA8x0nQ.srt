1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,000
   

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,070
Guglielmo Marconi's first radio transmissions in 1894

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,239
have spread into space for over 100 years

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,420
at the speed of light. They passed Sirius in 1903,

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,510
Vega in 1919, and

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,560
Regulus in 1971. That signal has already

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,570
passed over 1,000 stars. Anyone orbiting one of

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,640
those stars, with a really good receiver, could detect Marconi's

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,680
signal and know that we are here. Radio waves

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,710
are the longest, and contain the least energy, of any electromagnetic wave.

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,750
While visible light is measured in minute fractions

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,790
of an inch, radio waves vary from about 19 centimeters,

14
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,840
about the length of a water bottle, to waves the length of cars,

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,880
ships, mountains, all the way up to monstrous waves longer than

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,940
the diameter of our planet. Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,990
in 1888. The first commercial radio station

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,110
went on the air in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 2, 1920.

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,210
Then in 1932, a major discovery

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:21,270
by Karl Jansky at Bell Labs revealed that stars and other objects

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,370
in space radiated radio waves! Radio astronomy was born.

22
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,480
However, scientists need giant antennas to detect

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,610
weak, long-wavelength, radio waves from space.

24
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,800
The enormous Arecibo radio dish antenna measures

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,020
305 meters in diameter, over three football fields.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,110
Scientists can link the signals from an array of separate radio antennas to

27
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,160
focus on tiny slices of distant space. Such arrays act as

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,170
a single immense collector. This giant New Mexico array

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,190
uses 27 parabolic dish antennas shaped into a giant "Y"

30
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,210
with each arm capable of stretching for 13 miles!

31
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,210
Scientists have even spread these linked antennas across the globe.

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,220
One of the largest stretches from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,230
and acts like such a powerful telephoto lens that a baseball sitting

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,250
on the moon would fill its entire field of view.

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,260
Many of the greatest astronomical discoveries have been made using radio waves.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Pulsars, the existence of giant clouds of superheated

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,290
plasma, which are among the largest objects in the Universe,

38
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,300
and even quasars, such as this one over 10 billion light years away,

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,320
were all discovered using radio waves.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,330
Radio waves also provide more local information. Astronomical objects

41
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,360
that have a magnetic field usually produce radio waves

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,370
such as our Sun. Thus, NASA's STEREO satellite is able to

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,390
monitor bursts of radio waves from the Sun's corona.

44
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,410
WAVE sensors on the WIND spacecraft record the radio waves

45
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,420
emitted by a planet's ionosphere, such as the bursts from Jupiter whose

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,430
wavelength measures about fifteen meters. Radio waves

47
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,440
fill the space around us to bring entertainment, communications,

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,440
and key scientific information. We can't hear these radio waves.

49
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,450
When you tune your radio to your favorite station,

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,460
the radio receives these electromagnetic radio waves and then vibrates a speaker

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
to create the sound waves we hear. We may not be able to tap our

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
toes to the cosmic radio transmissions, but we certainly discovered

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,510
much about our Universe's grand cosmic dance

54
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,310
by listening to them.

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,680
our satellites, and other electronics here on Earth.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Other NASA instruments monitor the changes in other aspects

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,710
of the Earth's climate system, such as clouds, aerosol particles,

58
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,720
or surface reflectivity, and scientists are examining their many

59
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,730
interactons with the energy budget. A portion of solar radiation

60
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,750
from the Sun that is just beyond the visible spectrum is referred to

61
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,770
as near-infrared. Scientists can study how this radiation

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,780
reflects off the Earth's surface to understand changes in land cover

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
such as growth of cities or changes in vegetation. Our eyes

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,850
perceive a leaf as green because wavelengths in the green region

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,899
of the visible light spectrum are reflected while other visible wavelengths

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,940
are absorbed. Yet, the chlorophyll and the cell structure of the

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,990
leaf are also reflecting near-infrared light, light we cannot see.

68
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,080
This reflected near-infrared radiation can be

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,120
sensed by satellites, allowing scientists to study vegetation from space.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,160
Using these data, scientists can identify some

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,210
types of trees, can examine the health of forests, and can even

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,260
monitor the health of vegetation such as forests infested with pine beetles

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,320
or crops affected by drought. Studying the emission and

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,330
reflection of infrared waves helps us to understand the Earth's system

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,340
and its energy budget. Near-infrared data can also help scientists

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,340
study land cover such as changes in snow, ice,

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,350
forests, urbanization, and agriculture.

78
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Scientists are beginning to unlock the mysteries of cooler objects across

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,410
the Universe such as planets, cool stars, nebulae,

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,430
and much more using infrared waves.
