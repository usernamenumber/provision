1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
   

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,710
There's a new reality television
program, and it's

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,410
called the Blue-- I should
probably write it in blue--

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,570
but it's called the Blue
Forehead Room.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,140
   

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,480
And what they do in this reality
television program--

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,730
and you'll have to bear with me,
because the show probably

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,650
wouldn't be that interesting
to watch-- but it's

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,190
interesting to predict
what happens.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,670
What they do is, they
take a room.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,930
They'll call it the blue
forehead room.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,695
And let's see, that's kind of
a top view of the room.

13
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:37,300
And let's say there's
a door here.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,140
None of this is relevant
to the actual problem.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,880
This is the door, right there.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,050
And what they do is they get 100
perfect logicians to sit

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,220
in this room, in a circle.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:56,490
So they're all sitting in
a circle in this room.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,470
Now, before the game even
starts, before they even enter

20
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,629
the room the first time, the
logicians are told two things.

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:15,910
They're told, One: that at
least one of you has your

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,320
forehead painted blue.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:27,030
   

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,780
At least one of you has your
forehead-- And they all get

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,600
their foreheads painted, so that
obviously if you're the

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,810
only guy who has your
forehead painted.

27
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,170
But you just don't know
what color it is.

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,680
So all of them have different
color foreheads.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,760
Or, we don't know.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,230
But all they're told
is, obviously I've

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,370
painted your forehead.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,540
At least one of the people in
the room that you will enter

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,280
will have their forehead
painted blue.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,500
And then they're also told that
as soon as you deduce

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:04,980
that your forehead is blue, you
need to leave the room.

36
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,430
   

37
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,880
And what's going to happen is--
and it's very important

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,910
that I set this up properly.

39
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,680
They're all outside
of the room.

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,090
No-one's inside the room.

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,770
And let's say they're
blindfolded.

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,860
And while they're blindfolded,
they essentially have the

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,400
thing painted onto
their forehead.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,780
So they can't see the paintbrush
or anything.

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,640
So they really don't know what's
on their forehead.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,330
And then after that, they
all enter the room.

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,720
And they all sit in a circle
like this, so that they can

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,625
all look at each other.

49
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:46,000
And let's say when they enter,
the lights are off.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,180
So the lights are off, and then
the protocol is that the

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,610
lights will be turned on, and
then they can all look around

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,030
at each other.

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,540
There's no reflective
surfaces.

54
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,400
They can't look into each
other's eyes and try to see

55
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,970
the reflection.

56
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,810
No tricks like that.

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,030
There are no mirrors
in this room.

58
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,730
Nothing like that.

59
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,440
All they can do is look
at each other.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,180
So, just as an example,
let's say that

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,860
this is me right here.

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,080
As soon as the lights get turned
on the first time, I'll

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,290
be able to look at all the
other people in the room.

64
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,190
And I could see, it'll be pretty
obvious to me if anyone

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,100
has a blue forehead.

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,550
Maybe that guy has one,
that guy doesn't.

67
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,650
I don't know, right?

68
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,170
And I can see them.

69
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,160
I can't see my own forehead.

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,460
And what happens is, then they
will turn off the lights, and

71
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,090
the way they're going to do it
is you have to leave the room

72
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,290
after you have realized that
you have a blue forehead.

73
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,550
So for example, let's say I
enter into the room, and

74
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,530
because I'm a perfect logician
I see things that allow me to

75
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,890
perfectly deduce that I
have a blue forehead.

76
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,820
Then what they're going to do
is they're going to turn off

77
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,240
the lights again.

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,900
And then, if I know that I have
a blue forehead while the

79
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,080
lights are turned off, I
would leave the room.

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,030
And then when they turn the
lights back on, I'd be gone.

81
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,450
So there would be no Sal here.

82
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,450
So let's say there were 100
before, then there would be 99

83
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,960
guys sitting in the room.

84
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,200
Right?

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,090
As soon as I realize I have a
blue forehead, when the lights

86
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,740
get turned off, I leave. And
just remember these are

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,570
perfect logicians.

88
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,990
So everyone in the room.

89
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,910
And not only are they all
perfect logicians, but they

90
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,830
all know that everyone else
is a perfect logician.

91
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:33,120
So, everyone is also told, and
this is true, everyone is a

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
perfect logician.

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,285
Which means they have infallible
powers of logic.

94
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:44,310
   

95
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,620
So my question to you-- Just
remember, I have each of these

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,030
perfect logicians.

97
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,820
We set them up outside of the
room, paint their foreheads.

98
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,590
They're blindfolded.

99
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,840
They have no clue.

100
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,010
Then we have all of them walk
into a dark room, sit in a

101
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,760
circle like this.

102
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,240
And then what we tell them is,
as soon as you realize that

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,420
you have a blue forehead, as
soon as you have a blue

104
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,080
forehead, you have to
leave the room.

105
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,810
Now my question to you is, let's
say that we've actually

106
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,580
painted everybody's
forehead blue.

107
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,130
What happens?

108
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,650
So remember, this is what we've
told each of the people.

109
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:21,930
Right?

110
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,030
As soon as you realize your
forehead is blue,

111
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,400
you leave the room.

112
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,460
And now I've just asked you, the
producers like to really

113
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,740
play with these logicians.

114
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,150
They've actually painted
everybody's forehead blue.

115
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,090
So when everyone goes in the
room the first time, what's

116
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,900
going to happen?

117
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,400
Let's say I'm one of
the logicians.

118
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,690
This is me right here.

119
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,990
As soon as I open my eyes, I'm
going to see 99 other fellow

120
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,680
logicians with blue foreheads.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,550
And then, maybe I can somehow
deduce something about my own.

122
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,480
I don't think you can.

123
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,340
And the lights will go off.

124
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,950
And then if I haven't deduced
anything about my own blueness

125
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,770
of my forehead, then they'll
turn the lights back on.

126
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,980
And then maybe some other
guy will have left.

127
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,320
I don't know.

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,080
Or maybe not.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,120
And then I'll see the
same 99 guys again.

130
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,530
And that'll just keep occurring

131
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,630
until something happens.

132
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,600
And my question to you
is what happens?

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,610
When?

134
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,860
And why?

135
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,380
   

136
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,760
I'm thinking whether I should
give you a hint right now.

137
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,740
Well let me tell it
to you this way.

138
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,650
That's the problem.

139
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,800
You should be able
to solve it.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,810
And just so you know where this
came from, if I remember

141
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,740
correctly I think this was
on a computer science

142
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,150
exam I had at MIT.

143
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,040
So just so you know, this
isn't just for fun.

144
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,000
   

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,860
I don't want to go into all of
the applications that this

146
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,390
type of problem can apply to,
because that by itself would

147
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,620
be a bit of a hint.

148
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,110
So if you don't want a hint,
turn off the video

149
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,090
now or pause it.

150
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,990
If you do want a hint, I'm
about to give it to you.

151
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,440
So my hint is-- and remember
turn this off if you don't

152
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,560
want to hint-- but the hint is
what happens when there are

153
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,720
less than 100 people.

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
So I gave the situation where
we have 100 logicians.

155
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,050
But this problem is actually a
lot easier if you try it with

156
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,560
a smaller number.

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,990
Anyway I'll see you in
the solution video.

158
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,667
