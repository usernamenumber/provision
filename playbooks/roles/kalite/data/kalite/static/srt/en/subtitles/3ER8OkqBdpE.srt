1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,390
Good morning or evening or
whatever it is where you are,

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,340
wherever you're happening
to watch this movie.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,810
Anyway, I've been requested to
do a playlist on probability,

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,630
and I think that's an excellent
idea, so I will start doing

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,670
a playlist on probability.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,110
So let's do a playlist
on probability.

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,070
It's a good place to
start probability.

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,870
I don't do videos on spelling.

9
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,100
Probability: so what is it?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,870
And I think all of us
have kind of a sense of

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,560
it, very informally.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,260
And as far as I can tell there
actually isn't a formal

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,920
definition of what
a probability is.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,670
There are several almost
formal competing definitions.

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,370
So just in our everyday life,
you know if the weather man

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,810
says there's a 50% percent
chance of rain the next

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,490
day, he's essentially
giving a probability.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,650
He's saying that-- well,
there's a couple of ways

19
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,800
that you could interpret
the 50% probability.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,130
It could be that if 100% was
that he is sure there's rain

21
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,000
tomorrow and 0% is that he is
not sure that there's is rain

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,970
tomorrow, that 50% kind of
means well, he's kind of

23
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,680
neutral between those
two possibilities.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,330
So one definition could be
how strongly you believe.

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,240
   

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,150
Actually, there's a whole
school of probability where

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,510
they view probability like
this, and it's called the

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,080
Bayesian, and we'll
go into that more.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,060
Actually, when we do easy
problems, all of these things

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,330
kind of are the same thing.

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,140
But later on we'll see
what the difference is.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,390
Another way of interpreting
this and this is kind of the

33
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,360
frequentist school of thought,
is if I were to have the data

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,200
that this-- or if the weather
man had this data that he has

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,240
right now as far as where the
clouds are and what the

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,910
barometer reads and where the
moon is and all of the data.

37
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,240
Given all of the data that he
has, when he has that same

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,290
exact data hundred times,
fifty times or 50% of those

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,240
times there will be rain.

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,230
So you can almost view it as,
given the data that he has, if

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,570
you had that data a hundred
times or if you were able to

42
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,860
run this experiment a hundred
times-- although that's very

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,820
unlikely that you would have
that exact same number

44
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,760
of data points.

45
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,200
You know, whether Mars is
in the right place and the

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,610
sun is flaring and all.

47
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,840
It's very unlikely you have
those exact same-- you know,

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,650
the butterfly effect.

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,500
One butterfly can affect the
wind patterns across the ocean.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,120
So it's very unlikely that you
could perform that experiment a

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,130
hundred times, but what the
weather man could be saying is

52
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,430
well, if I did have data
identical to this, a hundred

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,410
times, 50 of those times or
50% of the time we would

54
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,700
have rain the next day.

55
00:02:48,700 --> 00:03:01,010
That's 50% of experiments with
same-- I guess you could say

56
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,650
measurable initial conditions--
I'm kind of doing this on the

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,920
fly so don't take
this as gospel.

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,670
But it I think it'll
give you the sense.

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,700
With same initial conditions,
would result in rain.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,120
   

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,360
They're almost the same thing,
but we'll see later that this

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,700
frequentist-- I tend to view
the world kind of like this,

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,310
but there are a lot of
circumstances where you

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,940
really-- it's hard to say that
you could perform that same

65
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,490
exact experiment over again.

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,470
For example, if someone said in
2003 there's a 50% chance or

67
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,660
there's an 80% chance that
Saddam Hussein has weapons of

68
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,970
mass destruction, that I think
would-- and that would

69
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,520
be a probability.

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,770
You know, you'd have these CIA
analysts who aren't being

71
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,790
influenced by their bosses
saying hey, after all the data

72
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,590
we see, we can't be sure, but
we think there's an 80% chance.

73
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,650
They would be in
this camp, right?

74
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,870
Because you really couldn't
perform that experiment

75
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,610
a hundred times.

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,870
There haven't been a hundred
times or a thousand times or a

77
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,430
large number of times where you
had that exact same set of

78
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,330
circumstances where you a guy
with the big mustache in the

79
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,710
Middle East kind of giving
the run around for

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,660
weapons inspectors.

81
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,790
Anyway, so let's move on.

82
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,770
This is very subtle, but it
gives you the difference

83
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,110
between these two things.

84
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,090
It's quite subtle, but I think
it gives you nice frame work

85
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,060
for what probability is.

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,450
So let's just do a
little bit of notation.

87
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,940
I actually looked it up on
Wikipedia and they had one

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,320
definition-- maybe it
wasn't Wikipedia, it was

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,290
maybe another website.

90
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,210
And actually, I think you
do see this definition of

91
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,490
lot where they say the
probability-- sometimes it's

92
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,090
written as probability of a.

93
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,430
Sometimes it's just
written as P of a.

94
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:54,480
So the probability of a
occurring is equal to the

95
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:06,810
events in which a is true
over total number of events.

96
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,130
And this, for the most part,
can be a good definition, but

97
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,630
I'll show you one place where
I think it's a little

98
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,450
bit more squirmy.

99
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,270
So if I told you that I'm
going to flip a coin and--

100
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,990
actually, even better.

101
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,930
Let's say, let's roll a dice.

102
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,640
And let's say I say the
probability-- I'm going

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,730
straight to more
difficult things.

104
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,670
So say the probability
of an even number.

105
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,040
Well, let's use this
definition that they gave.

106
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,630
Well, what's the probability
that this event is true?

107
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,290
Well, let's see, what are all
the numbers I could get?

108
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,110
I could get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

109
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,030
This is just a normal die, it's
not one of those Dungeons

110
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,800
and Dragon's dice.

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,850
So what are the number of
events where we get an even

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,640
number, where this is
true, where even is true?

113
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,390
Let's see.

114
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,490
2, 4, 6.

115
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,250
Those are all the situations
where we get even as true.

116
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,070
So there are 3 where
even is true.

117
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,110
And then, what is the
total number of events?

118
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,860
Well, we could get 1 of 6
numbers, so there are 6 total.

119
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,440
And that equals 1/2.

120
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,300
And that also
equals 50%, right?

121
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,770
We know how to convert
fractions to percentages.

122
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,970
And this is right, this
is completely right.

123
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,700
But the only time where you can
really apply this and most of

124
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,980
what you'll do in school and
things you can apply this, but

125
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,760
this assumes that all of the
events are equally

126
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,640
likely to occur.

127
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,400
You could have had a dice or
a die-- I forgot how to say

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,280
the plural or the singular.

129
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,410
You could have that situation
where maybe the six-sided is

130
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,340
weighted a little bit more.

131
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,220
You know, someone's handed
it down so it's more likely

132
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,340
to have a 3 or something.

133
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,780
And in that case, you wouldn't
be able to use this definition.

134
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,520
So I'm going to modify
this definition, although

135
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,830
I don't know if it's
traditionally modified.

136
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,620
This is one possible, events
in which a is true divided

137
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,210
by-- well, let's say,
equally probable.

138
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,090
Equally probable events in
which a is true divided by

139
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:11,580
equally probable total events.

140
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,300
So in order for this to hold
true each of these six

141
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,260
circumstances have to have
exact equal chance

142
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,110
of occurring.

143
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,370
And we're going to do maybe
in this video, actually

144
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,250
probably not in this, I
only have 3 minutes left.

145
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,830
But in this series I'll show
you situations where you we'll

146
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:32,160
have an unfair dice or die
or we'll have a set of

147
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,180
circumstances where all of--
each of the total number events

148
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,410
they're not equally probable.

149
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,790
So that's why I want you
become a little bit

150
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,900
weary of this situation.

151
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,800
So with that said, let's do a
couple of probability problems

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,520
that maybe give you a little
bit more intuition for--

153
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,460
whoops-- for what's going on
here in the world

154
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,900
of probability.

155
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,070
So if I'm flipping a dice and
I said, well, what's the

156
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,620
probability of heads?

157
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,300
That's pretty easy.

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,080
We could use that definition
and it's a completely

159
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
fair dice.

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,330
We could use that definition
and say, well, what are the

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,800
total number of events where
I could get heads

162
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
or tails, right?

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,190
So there's 2 total events.

164
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,490
And the probability the
getting heads, that's

165
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,105
one of the events.

166
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:14,210
So there's a 1/2 probability.

167
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,260
The way I like to think of it
so we don't have to use that

168
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,970
previous definition is, if I
were to conduct this experiment

169
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,260
a hundred times, what
percentage of those times am

170
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,410
I likely to get heads?

171
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,340
And then I would say, well,
there's 50% of the time

172
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,290
I would get heads.

173
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,020
And the reason why, you know, I
could make a symmetry argument

174
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,650
that it's just as likely to go
on heads as it is to tails.

175
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,330
There's no reason why I
would expect 51 heads or

176
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,224
49 nine tails, although
that could happen.

177
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,720
But there's no reason
I could expect it.

178
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,580
Heads and tails are
equally likely.

179
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,670
They're just different words
for different sides of a

180
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,970
coin that's equally likely
to fall on either side.

181
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,050
Anyway, let's say I'm going
to now flip a coin twice.

182
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,790
And it's the same coin.

183
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,040
So I'm going to flip it, and
then I'm going to pick it up,

184
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,050
and I'm going to flip it again.

185
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,960
And so what's the probability
that I get-- I'll

186
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,970
call it heads, heads.

187
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,950
So that's the probability that
I get heads on the first flip

188
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,550
and then heads on
the second flip.

189
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,870
Well, look at it this way.

190
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,010
If on the first flip we already
know that we have a 5% chance

191
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,210
or 1/2 chance on the
first flip, right?

192
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,300
So let's think of it of the
frequentist philosophy.

193
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,840
So if I were to do this a
hundred times, 50 of the

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,690
times I would get heads.

195
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,340
Let's call that on
the first flip.

196
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,790
Then of course, 50 of the
times I would get tails

197
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,970
on the first flip, right?

198
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,010
Now we're at this state of the
universe and now we do the

199
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,480
experiment over again.

200
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,880
So of these 50 times, what
percentage of the times is

201
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,320
the next flip going
to be heads again?

202
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,850
Well, we could say it's going
to be another 50% chance, or

203
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,780
you could say, well, in 50
tries the first one was heads,

204
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,510
and then of those 50, 50%
are going to be heads again.

205
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,270
So we get 25%.

206
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,080
I just multiplied
these two numbers.

207
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,910
And of course, to get heads and
then tails would be 25% chance.

208
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,230
Heads Heads, heads tails,
and then this is tails

209
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,546
heads, tails heads.

210
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm getting confused.

211
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,360
Tail heads is 25%.

212
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,710
And then tails tails is 25%.

213
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,365
Anyway, I'm rushing it
because I'm 25 seconds over.

214
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,660
I'll continue this
in the next video.
