1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
   

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,820
We just finished, hopefully,
getting intuition for why my

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,130
initial pressure times my
initial volume divided by my

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,290
initial temperature is going
to equal-- if I change the

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,540
volume, the pressure, the
temperature, or some

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,820
combination of all of them,
it's going to equal my new

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,780
pressure times my new volume
divided by my new temperature.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,540
And once again, just remember
all of this-- pressure times

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,750
volume is proportional to the
amount of kinetic energy in

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,660
the system, and temperature is
proportional to the amount of

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,500
kinetic energy per molecule.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,490
If we don't change the number of
molecules, the amount-- and

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,010
since by the conservation of
energy, the amount of kinetic

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,270
energy isn't going to change
unless we do some work, or get

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,120
some potential energy-- these
quantities and this

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,240
relationship won't change.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,730
Watch the last video, and
hopefully you'll get some

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,830
intuition-- if it's still
confusing, I'll make another

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,040
video for you guys.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,230
Before I apply this equation--
this is going to get you

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,860
pretty far in thermodynamics
just knowing this, and even

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,700
more just having the intuition
of what it means.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,630
I want to clarify something
about temperature-- there's a

24
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,280
lot of different ways to
measure temperature.

25
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
We know that in Fahrenheit,
what's freezing of water?

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,590
It's 32 degrees Fahrenheit
that's freezing, but that's

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,080
also 0 degrees Celsius--
actually, that's how the

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,170
Celsius scale was determined.

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,470
They said, where does water
freeze, and then where does

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,580
water boil?

31
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,970
100 degrees for Celsius
is boiling, and that's

32
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,190
how they rated it.

33
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,130
You could be colder than the
freezing of water, and you'd

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,120
have to go negative in that
situation-- Fahrenheit, I'm

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
actually not sure.

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,380
I need to look that up in
Wikipedia, or that might be

37
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,150
something for you to do, and
tell me how it came out.

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,610
I think the boiling of water in
Fahrenheit is 212 degrees,

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,710
so it's a little arbitrary.

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,790
I think Fahrenheit might be
somehow related to human body

41
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,910
temperature, but I'm
just guessing.

42
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,660
You can have different scales
in this situation, and they

43
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,230
were all kind of
a bit arbitrary

44
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,690
when they were designed.

45
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,520
They were just to have some type
of relative to scale--

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,460
you could say when things are
boiling, they're definitely

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,370
hotter because they have a
higher temperature then when

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,620
things are freezing.

49
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,440
   

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,790
You can't divide 100 by zero,
but if something is 1 degree,

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,990
is it necessarily the case that
something that is 100

52
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,160
degrees Celsius is a hundred
times hotter, or has a hundred

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,280
times the kinetic energy?

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
Actually, what we'll see is that
no, it's actually not the

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,540
case-- you don't have 100 times
the kinetic energy, so

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,440
this is a bit of an
arbitrary scale.

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,690
The actual interval is
arbitrary-- you could pick the

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,900
1 degree as being one hundredth
of the distance

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,160
between zero and 100, but where
you start-- at least in

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,540
the Celsius scale-- is
a bit arbitrary.

61
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,690
They picked the freezing
of water.

62
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,340
Later on, people figured out
that there is an absolute

63
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,390
point to start at.

64
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,430
And that absolute point to start
at is the temperature at

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,230
which a molecule or an atom has

66
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,150
absolutely no kinetic energy.

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,910
Because we said temperature is
equal to the average kinetic

68
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:15,310
energy of the system, or the
total kinetic energy of the

69
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,870
system divided by the
number of molecules.

70
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,840
Or we could also
say the average

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,390
kinetic energy per molecule.

72
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,390
   

73
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,940
The only way to really say that
the temperature is zero--

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,230
and this is proportional,
because the temperature scales

75
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,370
are still a little bit
arbitrary-- the only way to

76
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,120
get to a temperature of zero
should be when the kinetic

77
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,070
energy of each and every
molecule is zero, or the

78
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,635
average kinetic energy.

79
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:51,220
So they're not moving, they're
not vibrating, they're not

80
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,220
even blinking-- these molecules
are stationary.

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,645
The point at which that occurs
is called absolute zero.

82
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:03,090
   

83
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,330
That actually occurs-- absolute
zero, which is also

84
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:16,149
called zero Kelvin, and that is
the same thing as minus 273

85
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,579
degrees Celsius.

86
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,570
Nowhere in the universe, at
least that I'm aware of, it is

87
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,020
it colder than minus 273 degrees
Celsius-- at that

88
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,810
temperature, nothing moves,
even at the atomic scale.

89
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,940
I'm talking that the electrons
collapse into the nucleus--

90
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,230
everything is completely
stationary at zero Kelvin.

91
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,250
It's a theoretical absolute
limit-- maybe we'll do a bunch

92
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,390
of videos on how you can get
close to that, but in

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,900
laboratory environments or maybe
in deep space, it gets

94
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,270
really, really close to this.

95
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,570
   

96
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm pretty sure nowhere in the
universe do we have absolutely

97
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,280
zero Kelvin, or at least in any
place where we actually

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,560
have particles, but I might be
wrong there-- that's a little

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,910
bit out of the scope of what
we're talking about.

100
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,840
The true way to measure
temperature is in Kelvin.

101
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,460
When you're measuring in Kelvin,
if I say-- I have

102
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,360
something that is 1 kelvin
versus something that is 5

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,560
kelvin, since we nailed down the
bottom at a point at which

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,530
really do not have kinetic
energy, I can make the

105
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,410
statement that this has five
times the energy of something

106
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,600
that's at 5 Kelvin
versus 1 Kelvin.

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,300
That whole long explanation
about Kelvin, that was to just

108
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,140
to make the point that whenever
we use this formula,

109
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,440
or really any formula in
thermodynamics that involves

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,160
temperature, we should convert
to Kelvin, unless we're just

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,300
doing change in temperature.

112
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,550
Then you could you could
probably keep it Celsius, but

113
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,910
when you're doing
proportionality, or you're

114
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,400
using it for multiplying or
dividing by temperature, you

115
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,500
have to use Kelvin.

116
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,360
Hopefully, I made a little
bit clear of why that is.

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,610
Let's do an example.

118
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,570
   

119
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,690
You'd be surprised how
far this takes you.

120
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,880
Really, the main trick is
just to remember to

121
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,890
convert things to Kelvin.

122
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,780
That's the number one reason why
people miss questions on

123
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,610
thermodynamics exams-- is that
they didn't convert to Kelvin.

124
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,680
This problem is very typical of
most of what you'll see--

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,150
this is from the Barron's AP
physics B on page 226.

126
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:35,320
It says a confined gas is a
temperature of 27 degrees, so

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,520
its initial temperature
is 27 degrees Celsius.

128
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:51,640
It has a pressure of 1,000
pascals, or newtons per meter

129
00:06:51,640 --> 00:07:01,270
squared, and the volume
is 30 meters.

130
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,650
I think in one of the early
videos, I think I said newtons

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,080
per meter cubed, but it's
newtons per meter squared-- I

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,470
just want to make sure I
didn't confuse people

133
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,420
previously, so that's
the initial volume.

134
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,760
It says the volume is decreased,
so then we go to

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,650
this date, where my new
volume is going to

136
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,270
be 20 meters cubed.

137
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,610
The new temperature is
increased, and so the new

138
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,380
temperature is now 50
degrees Celsius.

139
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,555
They want to know what
is the new pressure?

140
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:35,150
   

141
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,500
Before we just substitute into
the equation, and solve for

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,890
the new pressure, remember--
if they gave it to you in

143
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,390
Celsius, convert to Kelvin.

144
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,460
If they gave it to you in
Fahrenheit, which they seldom

145
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,310
do, then convert into Celsius,
and then convert to Kelvin.

146
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,200
We already know that zero
Kelvin is equal

147
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,450
to minus 273 Celsius.

148
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:06,720
Or another way you could say it
is x Kelvin is equal to--

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,200
essentially, whatever degree you
get in Celsius, you just

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,370
add 273 to it.

151
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,560
Does that make sense?

152
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,440
Think of it this way: if
you're at zero degrees

153
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:28,480
Celsius, you're already 273
degrees above zero Kelvin.

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,720
Think about that, and hopefully
that makes sense--

155
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,650
maybe you want to draw a number
line just to make sure.

156
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,100
Whatever Celsius degree you
have, just add 273 to it, and

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,350
you'll get Kelvin.

158
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:44,000
   

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,340
Add 273 to 27 degrees Celsius,
and that's 300 Kelvin, and

160
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,510
then 50 degrees Celsius
is-- add 273 to it.

161
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:01,170
So 50 plus 273 is 323,
so now we can

162
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,330
substitute into this formula.

163
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:12,560
P1, 1,000 pascals times V1 times
30 divided by the first

164
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,630
temperature-- remember
to do it in Kelvin--

165
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,260
300, is equal to P2.

166
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,450
We don't know what that is.

167
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:29,970
P2 times V2 times 20 divided by
our new temperature, 323.

168
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,770
We can simplify this: we could
take two 0's off of here, take

169
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,450
two 0's off of here, then you
could take a 3 out of here,

170
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,620
and then take a 3 out of here,
and we're left with 100.

171
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:50,050
This is equal to 100-- that was
30,000 divided by 300, and

172
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,500
so that's 100 on the
left-hand side.

173
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:01,590
So we have 100 is equal to
P times 20 over 323.

174
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,390
I'm running out of time.

175
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:13,060
If I were to solve for it, 323
times 100 divided by 20

176
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,890
equals-- so my new pressure
is 1,615 pascals.

177
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,780
I just solved this equation,
and the hard part was

178
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,050
converting to Kelvin.

179
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,810
See you in the next video.

180
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:23,900
