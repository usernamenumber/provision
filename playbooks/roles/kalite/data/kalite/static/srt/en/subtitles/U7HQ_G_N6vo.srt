1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's learn a little bit about
the gradient, and we'll use the

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,200
same function we've been using
since we're pretty familiar

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
with it's graph and it's
partial derivatives.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:18,120
So let's say that f of x y is
equal to x squared plus x

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,840
times y plus y squared.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,730
Now we're going to take the
gradient of this, and then I'll

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,960
give you a little bit of
intuition on what

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,800
a gradient is.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,310
We're going to take the
gradient in two-dimensional

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,790
space, and you'll see what
that means in a second.

12
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,350
You can extend this
to any dimension.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,810
So the gradient that we use
this vector differential

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,820
operator-- this upside down
triangle-- the gradient of f is

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,670
equal to the partial of f in
the x direction times the unit

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,180
vector i-- which is the unit
vector in the x direction so it

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,960
gives the magnitude of the
slope and the x direction, and

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,720
then it points the vector in
that direction-- plus the

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,000
partial with respect to
y in the j direction.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,860
And obviously if there's a
function of more variables you

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,480
could keep going and you'd
multiply the magnitude of the

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,630
derivative in each of those
dimension's directions times

23
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,780
the unit vector in
that dimension.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,690
Well what does this mean?

25
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,280
And another way to view it, you
could have also written this as

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,910
the gradient of f is equal to
the partial with respect to x

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:39,830
of f of x y and then all of
that in the i direction.

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,320
This is just
different notation.

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,740
Plus the partial with respect
to y times f of x y.

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,550
Not times, operated
on f of x y.

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,870
So the partial of f of x y
with respect to y times

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,180
the j unit vector.

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,960
And because of this notation, a
lot of people view this delta

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,430
operator-- and actually it's
pretty consistent when we learn

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,080
about the divergence and the
curl-- a lot of people view

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,210
this delta operator, they
actually define it.

37
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,300
They say that is equal to the
partial with respect to x in

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,120
the i direction plus the
partial with respect to

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,940
y in the j direction.

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,200
And then if you wanted to do it
into three space-- that's not

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,190
going to apply to our problem
because we only care about

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,080
two dimensions right now.

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,700
And you'll see what I mean.

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,740
Because even though we're
applying it to a

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,210
three-dimensional surface, but
then you can do the partial

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,240
with respect to z
times the k vector.

47
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,030
And then you could extend it to
n dimensions, but it becomes

48
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,970
very hard to visualize.

49
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,920
Actually it becomes hard
to visualize beyond what

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
we're doing right now.

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,250
So what does this mean?

52
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,150
Well before I go into what it
means, let's actually calculate

53
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,170
it for this and then I'll
show you what it means.

54
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:58,700
   

55
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,620
Let's actually calculate
the gradient of f.

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,790
So the gradient of our
particular function, it's a

57
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,020
partial with respect to x.

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,850
So we figure that out.

59
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,050
That's 2x plus y, and then
that doesn't matter anymore.

60
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,160
So it's 2x plus y.

61
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,100
That's the partial of this
function with respect to x.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,195
And we multiply that in
the i direction, or

63
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:23,750
in the x direction.

64
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,705
Plus the partial with respect
to y, and this is 2y plus x.

65
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:31,540
   

66
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,450
And we calculated this in
the two videos on the

67
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,540
partial derivatives.

68
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,090
And we multiply that
in the j direction.

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,460
So what does that look like?

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,030
Well what are each of the
components of this vector?

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,110
What is 2x plus y in
the i direction?

72
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,170
What does that
vector look like?

73
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,240
What is 2y plus x in the
j direction look like?

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,645
And this I have graphed.

75
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:57,010
   

76
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,180
So this is the same surface
we've been working with, but

77
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,330
now I've plotted these
points right here.

78
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,300
These are just points that the
software has picked to actually

79
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,740
display these vectors.

80
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,880
And if you look at it,
this is the x-axis.

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,630
And I can rotate this.

82
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,130
I can pull it down
a little bit.

83
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,620
And then I can spin it around.

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,870
I think that's pretty neat.

85
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,030
But anyway.

86
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,200
This parallel to this
line is the vector in

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,640
the x-axis, right?

88
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,690
So at this point I've actually
calculated the gradient.

89
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,750
This vector says, what is the
magnitude of this vector is the

90
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,140
partial derivative of the
function, or the partial

91
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,070
derivative of the surface,
or the partial derivative

92
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,540
of z with respect to x.

93
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,790
And it's direction, it just
goes in the x direction,

94
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,950
because it's that times
the i unit vector.

95
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,775
So this vector is the partial
derivative of z with respect

96
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:54,550
to x times the i unit
vector at that point.

97
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,110
So we just calculated
the partial derivative

98
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:56,970
at that point.

99
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,800
It gave this length.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,480
And then the direction is just
the i unit vector, or in the

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,060
direction of increasing x.

102
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,490
Similarly, this vector right
here-- I hope you can see it.

103
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,950
Let me see if I can actually
zoom in a little bit.

104
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,100
That might be useful.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,590
Zoom in, there you go.

106
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,110
   

107
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,390
And I wanted to see the axes,
which you can't see now that

108
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,650
I'm zoomed in, but you took my
word this was the x direction.

109
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,040
Now this is the y direction,
or the same direction

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,580
as the j unit vector.

111
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,870
The j unit vector goes in
the same direction as y.

112
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,390
And the magnitude is determined
by the partial derivative of z

113
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,420
with respect to y
at that point.

114
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,280
And that's the magnitude.

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,130
And we saw there was some
symmetry, so the magnitude of

116
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,590
this vector is the same as the
magnitude of this vector.

117
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,660
And then when you add the
two vectors together,

118
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,280
you get this vector.

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,580
And notice that none of these
vectors have any dimensions

120
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,120
in the z dimension.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,540
They're all kind of giving you
directions in the x y plane.

122
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,930
And why is that interesting?

123
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,160
Well the gradient-- and this is
the intuition-- the gradient

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,400
tells you the direction in the
x y plane you should travel

125
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,330
in order to get the maximum
slope in the z dimension.

126
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,750
Or another way to view it.

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,990
Remember the partial derivative
with respect to x said what is

128
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,520
the slope in the x direction.

129
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,675
The partial derivative with
respect to y said what is the

130
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,710
slope in the y direction.

131
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,000
But you could take the partial
derivative with respect to any

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,420
direction, and the gradient
gives you the direction in

133
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,000
which the slope is the largest.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,940
So let me zoom out a little bit
because I want you to see the

135
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:50,970
actual axes There's the axes So
all this says if I were to

136
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,800
go in this direction, I
get the maximum slope.

137
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,620
So if I go in this direction,
my z goes up like that.

138
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,060
Let me see if I can rotate
this a little bit.

139
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,570
I don't want to
scale it anymore.

140
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,495
Let me do the rotated.

141
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:07,550
   

142
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,430
See if I can show that to you.

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:17,440
So if I go in that direction in
the x y plane, I get maximum z.

144
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,670
If I go in that direction I
get a maximum upward slope.

145
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,740
That's what the gradient tells
you, how do you get the

146
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,700
maximum upward slope.

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,920
And if you were to take any
closed line where the z is

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,410
constant-- well actually I
don't want to get into that too

149
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,085
much, but this gradient will
actually be normal to any, or

150
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,870
it'll be perpendicular to any
curve where z is constant.

151
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,820
I don't want to get too
involved with that right

152
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,750
now, so let's go back here.

153
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,880
Maybe it's more clear if we
look from below the graph.

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,020
So if you go to this point
right here, this is the

155
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,160
magnitude of this vector,
shows what is the slope

156
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
in the x direction.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,740
The magnitude of this vector
is what is the slope

158
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,770
in the y direction.

159
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,760
And then when you add them
together, you get the gradient.

160
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,220
And the gradient says, well, if
I travel in this direction in

161
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,150
the x y plane-- notice that
none of these have any z's.

162
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,270
The plane defined by all
of these vectors is all

163
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,950
flat in the z dimension.

164
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,960
But if I would have traveled
this direction in the x y

165
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,780
plane, then I will get the
maximum increase in z

166
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,950
per unit that I travel.

167
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,980
And let's actually show
you what it looks like

168
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,700
in the x y plane.

169
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,200
So if I just go head on-- so
I'm above the graph looking

170
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,580
straight down at the graph, and
then the colors just show kind

171
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,120
of you know where we are-- if I
travel in this direction in

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,750
the x y plane, I get my
maximum increase in z.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:51,160
If I'm here-- notice here the x
component of the gradient is

174
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,415
much larger than
the y component.

175
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:54,970
So I need to travel a little
bit more in the x direction,

176
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,470
and I'll get the maximum change
in z if I travel there.

177
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,320
Another way to think about it.

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,010
If I'm on a hill, the gradient
of that surface will tell you

179
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,300
at any point what direction you
need to travel in to go

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,450
up the hill fastest.

181
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,600
Or the direction which
the steepness of the

182
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,980
hill is maximum.

183
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,210
This is more of a bowl as
opposed to a hill, but anyway.

184
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,280
I'll just rotate it around.

185
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,780
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

186
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,320
And I want you to think
about it a little bit more.

187
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,840
And we'll do a few more
problems where we just

188
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,210
calculate gradients, just
because I think it's useful

189
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,280
to get the mechanics.

190
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,530
But in my opinion at least the
intuition is a little bit

191
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,765
harder to get your head around
than the actual mechanics,

192
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,130
but once you get it, it
makes a lot of sense.

193
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,950
I will see you in
the next video.

194
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,500
