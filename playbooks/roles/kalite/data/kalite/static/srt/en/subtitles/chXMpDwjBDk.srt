1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,520
Now that we know a little bit
about the formation and

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,190
enthalpy change, and what
enthalpy is, we can talk a

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,970
little bit about Hess's Law.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,520
   

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,020
And what this tells us is that
the energy change of a process

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,690
is independent of how we get
from one state to another.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,340
And really, that's a by-product
of the fact that

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,430
energy is a state variable.

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,740
Whether we're talking about
enthalpy or internal energy,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,470
they're state variables.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,180
And we've talked multiple times
that it's independent of

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,250
how many steps it takes to
get there, or what path

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,400
you happen to take.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,730
But how is that useful to us
when we're dealing with

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,495
everyday reactions?

17
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:46,990
So let me just make up some
reaction where I have A plus B

18
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,640
yields, oh, I don't know,
let's just say this

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,290
yields C plus D.

20
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,350
And I wanted to figure out
what was the change in

21
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,230
enthalpy of this reaction?

22
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,400
Or essentially, how much heat
is absorbed or released by

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:00,950
this reaction.

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,960
I don't know what it is.

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,000
I haven't measured it.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,290
And all I have are the
heats of formation.

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,630
So all I know is, how do you
go-- so I know the heat of

28
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,490
formation of A-- so let me call

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,620
that the heat of formation.

30
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,985
Remember, H isn't for heat.

31
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,180
Even though we kept calling
it heat of formation, it's

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,300
actually the change
in enthalpy.

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,670
And it's the standard
change in enthalpy.

34
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,630
But the change in enthalpy
we know as heat.

35
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,155
So it's heat, change in enthalpy
of formation was the

36
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,280
same thing as heat
of formation.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,620
This little naught sign
tells us it's a

38
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,130
standard heat the formation.

39
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,500
We can look up that in a table,
and let's say that

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,670
that's some number.

41
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,190
And then we have our heat of
formation of B-- delta heat of

42
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,460
formation, let me
call it, of B.

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,130
This Is heat of formation
of A, and it's a

44
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,750
standard heat of formation.

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,300
And we could look up in a table
that heat of formation

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,700
of C, which is change
in enthalpy.

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,870
And then the heat of
formation for D.

48
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,680
So all of these things we can
look up in a table, right?

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,330
And we'll do that in a second.

50
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,730
Now, what has Hess's law tells
us is that the change in

51
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,340
energy, the change in-- and
enthalpy is what we're

52
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,820
measuring here-- the change in
enthalpy here is independent

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,509
of what we're doing.

54
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,380
So instead of saying this
reaction, we could say hey,

55
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,365
let's go from this reaction, and
go back-- let me do it in

56
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,530
a different color.

57
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,430
Let's go back to our constituent
products, so kind

58
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,120
of the elemental
form of these.

59
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,080
So you know, if this was like
carbon dioxide, you'd be going

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,100
back to the carbon and
the oxygen molecules.

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,870
So you'd go back to the
elemental form.

62
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,000
And how much energy, or what's
the change in enthalpy, as you

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,040
go back to the elemental form?

64
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,480
The heat of formation is what
you get from the element of

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,600
form to A, or the elemental
form to B.

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,580
So to get A and B back to the
elemental form is going to be

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,920
the minus of those.

68
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
You're going to take
the reaction

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,470
in the other direction.

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,740
So this change is going to take
minus delta-- the heat

71
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,040
of, I guess, of forming A, or it
could be the minus the heat

72
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,670
of deconstructing A, you
can almost view it.

73
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,790
And it would also be minus
the same thing for B.

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,730
And then, this is just
the elemental form.

75
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,020
And now we can go from
the elemental

76
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,530
form back to the products.

77
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,010
Because we have the
same atoms here.

78
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,700
They're just rearranging
themselves into two different

79
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,300
sets of molecules.

80
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,880
So now we can go back from the
elemental form and go up here.

81
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,090
And we know what those are.

82
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,550
We know how much energy it takes
to go from the elemental

83
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,030
form to C and D.

84
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,800
That's their heats
of formation.

85
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,090
So Hess's Law tells us that
delta H of this reaction, the

86
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,840
change in enthalpy of this
reaction, is essentially going

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,780
to be the sum of what it takes
to decompose these guys, which

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,930
is the minus heat of formations
of these guys, plus

89
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,750
what it takes to reform
these guys over here.

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,270
So we can just write it as delta
H of formation for C

91
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,990
plus delta H of formation
for D.

92
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,400
So the heat of formations for
these guys minus these guys.

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,290
This is what it took you to
get to the elemental form.

94
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,630
So minus delta heat of formation
of A, minus delta

95
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,980
heat of formation of B.

96
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,720
And then you'll have the
heat of the reaction.

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,790
And if it's negative, we would
have released energy.

98
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,710
And if this number is positive,
then that means that

99
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,310
there's more energy here than on
this side, so we would have

100
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,430
to absorb energy for this
reaction to happen, and it

101
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,760
would be endothermic.

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,540
So this is all abstract and
everything, and I've told you

103
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,640
about Hess's Law.

104
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's actually apply it
to some problems.

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,740
So let's say I have this
reaction right here, where I

106
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,830
start with ammonia.

107
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,010
And it's ammonia gas.

108
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,050
And I'm going to react that with
molecular oxygen to yield

109
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,500
some nitrogen monoxide, 4 moles
of it, and some water.

110
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,790
So what's the heat of this
reaction right here?

111
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,360
So what we do, is we just look
up the heats of formation of

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,990
each of these.

113
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,440
So let's just look them up.

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's start with the ammonia.

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,420
What's the heat of formation
of ammonia?

116
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,010
And it's always given in
kilojoules per mole, so

117
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,800
they'll say to form one
mole of ammonia.

118
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,640
So to form 1 mole of ammonia--
let's look up here.

119
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,540
This is all cut and paste
from Wikipedia.

120
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,430
And am I starting in the gaseous
or the aqueous state?

121
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,540
Well, I think I just-- see, I'm

122
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,650
starting the gaseous state.

123
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,590
I've added that G there.

124
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,510
So ammonia in the gaseous state
has a heat of formation

125
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,660
of minus 45.9 per joule.

126
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,190
So what is that going--
so minus 45.9

127
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,420
kilojoules per mole.

128
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,480
   

129
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,170
That's just for one mole of

130
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,770
ammonia, the heat of formation.

131
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,240
It's in kilojoules.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,210
I'll just look them
all up right now.

133
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,725
Now what's the heat of
formation of oxygen?

134
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:55,760
And I'm not going to look it up
right now, because oxygen

135
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,680
is in its elemental form.

136
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,970
So if you see something in the
form that it just always

137
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,700
takes, before you do anything
to it, its heat of

138
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,570
formation is 0.

139
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,730
So if you see O2, its heat
of formation is 0.

140
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,970
If you see hydrogen, if you
see H2, its heat of

141
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,450
formation is 0.

142
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,940
If you see carbon by itself,
heat of formation is 0.

143
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,340
Carbon in the solid state, heat
of formation is 0, at

144
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,210
standard temperature
and pressure.

145
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,840
Now what about nitrogen
monoxide?

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,090
Let's look that up.

147
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,490
   

148
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,250
I have it right here.

149
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,680
Nitrogen monoxide.

150
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,770
Heat of formation.

151
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:36,810
It's positive, 90.29.

152
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,370
And finally, what's the heat
of formation of water?

153
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,620
Well, let me see.

154
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,890
   

155
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,910
Liquid water.

156
00:06:47,910 --> 00:07:00,000
Minus 285.83.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,430
Now you might tempted
to say, OK.

158
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,900
Hess's Law says that if if we
want the delta H for this

159
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,850
reaction, we just take this plus
this, and subtract that.

160
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,900
And you'd be almost right, but
you'd get the problem wrong.

161
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,000
Because these are the heat
of formation per mole.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,052
But we notice in this reaction,
we have 4 moles of

163
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:21,190
this, plus 5 moles of this,
yields 4 moles of this plus 6

164
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,090
moles of that.

165
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,310
So we have to multiply this
times the number of moles.

166
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,124
So here I have to multiply this
times 4, 4 here, and I

167
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:32,080
have to multiply it times 4
here, and I have to multiply

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
it times 6 here.

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,620
I don't even worry about
multiplying 0 times 5, because

170
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,970
it's just going to be 0.

171
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,090
So now we can apply Hess's Law
to figure out the delta H of

172
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,830
this reaction.

173
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,660
So the delta H of this reaction
is going to be equal

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,560
to, 4 times the heat of
formation of nitrogen

175
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,400
monoxide-- so 4 times 90.29,
plus 6 times the heat of

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,860
formation of water.

177
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:06,330
So plus, I'll switch colors,
6 times minus 285.83.

178
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,800
And just as a side note, given
that the heat of formation of

179
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,570
nitrogen monoxide is positive,
that means that you have to

180
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,320
add heat to a system to get this
to its elemental form.

181
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,650
So it has more energy than
its elemental form.

182
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,940
So it won't just happen
by itself.

183
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,460
And water, on the other hand,
it releases energy when you

184
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,230
form it from its
elemental form.

185
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,900
So in some ways, it's
more stable.

186
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,580
But anyway let me--

187
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,280
So these are the heats of
formations of the products.

188
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,590
And then we want to subtract out
the heats of formation of

189
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,470
the reactants in our reaction.

190
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,280
So here it's 4 times 45.9--
Let me make sure.

191
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,770
It's a minus 45.9.

192
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,120
Right?

193
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,220
That ammonia had a minus
45.9 heat of formation.

194
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,780
So what did we end up with?

195
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,680
Let me get the calculator out.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,522
So I have-- let me make sure
I put it over here.

197
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:04,640
I have to be able to read it.

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,840
Well, I'll just do it off the
screen, because my screen is

199
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,020
getting filled up.

200
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,610
So I have-- let me
just do it here.

201
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:28,600
4 times 90.29 plus 6 times
285.83 negative is equal to--

202
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,090
so so far, we're
at minus 1,353.

203
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,570
Does that sound about right?

204
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,370
That looks about right.

205
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,060
And now we want to subtract from
that 4 times minus 45.9.

206
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:51,710
So we want to subtract-- so
minus 4 times 45.9 negative is

207
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,870
equal to minus 1,170.

208
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,770
So our delta h of this reaction
is equal to minus

209
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:04,490
1,170 kilojoules for
this reaction.

210
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,270
And all we did is, we took the
heat of formation of the

211
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,400
products, multiply it times
the number of moles, and

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,320
subtracted out the
heat of formation

213
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,570
of the actual reactants.

214
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,120
There you go.

215
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,770
Let's do one more of these.

216
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,010
Let's say I had some propane.

217
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,440
I had some propane, and I'm
going to combust it.

218
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm going to oxidize the propane
to yield some carbon

219
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,710
dioxide in water.

220
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,830
Well, it's the same drill.

221
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,480
What's the heat of formation
of propane?

222
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,230
Look it up here.

223
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,330
It is amazing how exhaustive
these lists really are.

224
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,850
Propane is down here in
its liquid state.

225
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,976
Heat of formation minus 104.7.

226
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:41,600
So let me write that down.

227
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,470
Minus 104.7.

228
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,010
Heat of formation of oxygen
in its elemental state.

229
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,840
That's how you always
find oxygen.

230
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,000
So it's just 0.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,700
Heat of formation of carbon
dioxide-- Let's see.

232
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:04,170
Carbon dioxide, and as
a gas, minus 393.5.

233
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,800
And water.

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,900
We already figured that out.

235
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:12,960
It's minus 285.83.

236
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,120
So how much heat is formed when
we combust one mole of

237
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,750
propane right here?

238
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,850
So let's see.

239
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,120
We have to figure out the heat
of the products, the heat of

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,290
formation of the products-- so
it's going to be 3 times this.

241
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,760
Because we formed
3 moles of this.

242
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,520
For every mole, we release
this much energy.

243
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,610
And then plus 4 times
this, and then

244
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,280
subtract out 1 times this.

245
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,440
So what do we get?

246
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,900
We get 3 times 393.5
and that's a

247
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,320
negative, is equal to that.

248
00:11:48,320 --> 00:12:01,180
Plus 4 times 285.83 negative
is equal to minus 2,300

249
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,280
kilojoules, roughly.

250
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,680
And then we have to subtract
out 1 times this.

251
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,400
Or we could just add 104.7.

252
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,820
So let me just do that.

253
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:18,150
So plus 104.7 is equal
to minus 2,200.

254
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:25,450
So here my heat of this
reaction, is equal to minus

255
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:31,810
2,219 kilojoules as we
go in this direction.

256
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,050
For every mole of propane that
I combust, I will actually

257
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,630
produce this much energy
on the other side.

258
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,650
Because this right here has
roughly 2,200 less kilojoules

259
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,390
than this side right there.

260
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,860
So I could actually rewrite this
reaction where I write

261
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,140
all that, and I could
have added--

262
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,440
actually, let me do it.

263
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,870
I could rewrite this reaction
is C3H8 propane, plus 5

264
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:07,060
oxygens, yields 3 carbon
dioxides plus 4 waters plus

265
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,880
2,219 kilojoules.

266
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,160
That's actually what's released
by this reaction.

267
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,680
It's exothermic.

268
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,610
This side of the reaction has
less heat than this side, and

269
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,890
that-- it didn't
just disappear.

270
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,090
It got released.

271
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,390
And this is where
it got released.

272
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,430
Now sometimes you'll see a
question where they say, hey.

273
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,970
Fair enough.

274
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,850
You figured out the heat
of this reaction.

275
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,540
How much heat is going to be
released if I were to hand

276
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,210
you, I don't know, let's
say I were to hand

277
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,980
you 33 grams of propane?

278
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,690
Well, then you just start
thinking, oh, well, how many

279
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,960
moles of propane this is.

280
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,890
Because if I combust one
mole of propane, I

281
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,180
get this much heat.

282
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,240
So how many moles of propane
is 33 grams?

283
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,530
Well, how much does
1 mole weigh?

284
00:13:51,530 --> 00:14:02,520
The 1 mole of carbon weighs 12
grams. 1 mole of hydrogen

285
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,320
weighs 1 gram.

286
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,990
So 1 mole of propane is going to
be 3 times 12-- so times 3,

287
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,417
because we have 3 carbons there
and 8 hydrogens, so

288
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:18,870
times 8-- so it's going to
be equal to 36 plus 88.

289
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,900
So it's going to be 44.

290
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,750
So this is going to be 44
grams per mole, right?

291
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,930
This is, let me write
that down.

292
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,420
44 grams per mole.

293
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,680
Now, if I give you 33
grams, how many

294
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,050
moles am I giving you?

295
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:44,030
Well, 33 grams times, I guess we
could say, 1 over 44 moles

296
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,840
per gram-- I don't have to write
the whole gram there.

297
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,290
And then the grams cancel.

298
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm giving you 33 over
44 of a mole, or I'm

299
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,140
giving you 0.75 moles.

300
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,510
So if one mole produces this
much energy, 3/4 of a mole is

301
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,340
going to produce 3/4 of this.

302
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,960
So we just multiply
that times 0.75.

303
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,330
And you get 1,664.

304
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,990
So times 0.75 is
equal to 1,664.

305
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,710
So if I were to give you 1 mole
of propane, and I were to

306
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,020
combust it with enough oxygen,
I'll produce 2,200 kilojoules

307
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,450
that's released from
the system.

308
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,310
So this side of system has
less energy left over.

309
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,050
But if I were to only give you
33 grams, which is 3/4 of a

310
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,530
