1
00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:03,019
Where we left off in the last video

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:04,988
the north has just won the Civil War.

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:06,619
Unfortunately for Abraham Lincoln,

4
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:09,337
it was two months after he was assasinated;

5
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:11,204
but now the North was dominant and essentially

6
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:13,072
occupied the South.

7
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:14,919
And we enter a period called reconstruction

8
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,311
And reconstruction can refer to one of two things.

9
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,604
And they're somewhat related.

10
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:21,087
One is just the reconstruction from the war.

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,687
Obviously, there was a lot of damage done

12
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:24,321
to both sides.

13
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:27,120
But it's usually refered to the actual reconstruction to the south

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,501
and to some degree, kind of the reform of the south.

15
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:32,419
And I'm gonna glaze over lot of details,

16
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:33,654
like I did in the last video, and I might

17
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:36,553
ignore some major events that might have been important

18
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:37,960
but don't worry i'll get back to them

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,437
but the three big things that happened during reconstructions

20
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:45,287
other than the fact that the north were occupying the south

21
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,670
and essensially to a large degree suspending democracy in the south

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,420
and installing its own pollititions and its own law makers

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,770
is that the United States passed the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth ammendments

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,270
these are nown as the reconstructions ammendments.

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,103
and in 1865 you have the thirteenth ammendment

26
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:07,055
and this abolished slavery

27
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:09,054
ended slavery

28
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:11,137
we talked about the emancipation proclomation

29
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,054
and that was essentially Abraham Lincoln's exacutive orders

30
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,970
this was the speach he made but now it became an official law

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,204
in 1865

32
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,804
but in 1868 you have the fourteenth ammendment

33
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:28,269
which made everyone - ever person- born in the United States

34
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:31,386
a citizen and this includes the free slaves

35
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:34,420
so its kind of like the slaves are now free and they are also citizens

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,287
and in 1870 you have the fifteenth ammendment which gave all

37
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,586
free men the right to vote

38
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:46,504
and obviously now all men were free

39
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:47,936
so the right to vote

40
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:50,488
and I emphasize the MEN because even at this point

41
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:53,170
women did not have the right to vote

42
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,889
the right to vote

43
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,428
and the fourteenth ammendment also introduced the

44
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:58,878
due process which i wont go into details here,

45
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:02,311
but it essentially said "look the government has to go

46
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,581
under a due process or

47
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,111
where essentially it has its its

48
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,035
subject to its own laws when determining

49
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:13,261
whether it can take away property from or in some

50
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:19,478
way incurr, I guess, in some way infringe on rights of other people but we'll talk, we'll probably do

51
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,261
a whole video on that

52
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:23,510
but these were the real take aways so it really brought the

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,828
former slaves, at least by law, by these ammendments on equal

54
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:32,295
standing. but we know that in practice that didn't happen. And you go fastforwards to

55
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:37,096
1877 and you essentially have the Reconstruction

56
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:40,760
period formally ending, the occupation of the South formally ends and as soon

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,695
as the occupation of the South formally ends you essentially

58
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:49,246
and Democracy comes about you have a bunch of people coming to power and at this point of time the Republicans

59
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:58,060
were essentially, the North and these were the people who were kind of anti-slavery and you know, Abraham

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,829
Lincoln was Republican and the Democrats come to power in the South and we can talk about how the different

61
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,760
perceptions of the different parties change over time but at this point as soon as the occupation ended

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,597
and to a large degree and you know I put Democracy in quotes because even in this period the North had essentaily

63
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:17,766
not occupied it anymore but the elections--these were things that were heavily contested, you have both

64
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:29,918
sides of them kind of exerting force and in particular you have the Jim Crow Laws being passed in the

65
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:37,451
South and they're called "Jim Crow" based on this parody of the early 1800s. It was a practice for white

66
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:47,318
men in the South at this time were even well before this in order to parody blacks they would paint their

67
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:53,968
face black and they would act silly and all of this. Jim Crow was the name of one of these characters

68
00:03:53,968 --> 00:04:00,134
that was protrayed in the early 1800s--I think Jumping Jim Crow was the name--so that's where the laws

69
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:07,618
come from, but the Jim Crow laws essentially segregated blacks and whites in the South and even though

70
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:11,919
the idea might have been that they were equal, the reality were that the conditions for blacks--the places

71
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,367
that they were separated to--were far inferior. They had to use separate drinking fountains, they had

72
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:21,934
to use separate bathrooms, they couldn't sit in the same parts of theaters or in the same parts of buses.

73
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:27,201
And these lasted all the way until the Civil Rights Movement--all the way to the 1960s. Now, at the same

74
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:47,700
time that all of this was happening, you kinda had this post-war, this post-Civil War boom in the econom,

75
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,121
where you hadthis kind of massive building of the railroads and steam engines and you know...to some

76
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,900
degree it was the First--well, I don't want to say the first, there was kind of many- there was kind

77
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,364
of many ages of mass inovation--but all of these things tend to lead to a little bit of a bubble. And

78
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,415
then in 1873, what you have happening is a lot of the governments of the world start to go off of the

79
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:03,516
gold and silver standard and they go to the gold standard. And what that happens is that anyone left

80
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:09,848
on the silver standard or partially both, the gold and silver standard, their currency would de-value,

81
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:11,810
and back then it was known as an unbalanced negative for your currency to de-value, we can later talk

82
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:23,735
about that... and so the US decides to follow and the big, the big actor here was Germany that decided

83
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:29,586
to go off of the silver standards and go on the pure gold standard. And so the US decided to follow suit

84
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:36,785
with the Coinage Act, in 1873, but this leads to a huge--they called the Panic of 1870, theres a couple

85
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:41,550
of things here. One, it completely demolishes the price of silver, although it was happening on a normal

86
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:46,234
basis. It hurts the silver miners and the industries associated with the silver miners--but I guess more

87
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:49,872
importantly, it restricts the money supply, now I won't go into all of the economic stuff. When you restrict

88
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:58,222
the money supply, you essentially increase interest rates and it essentially pops the bubble that was

89
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:02,724
forming, due to the railroads and all of the booming business and then you essentially have the US entering

90
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:10,689
a depressionand that depression last from 1873 (when the Coinage Act and the bubble burst) all the way

91
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,872
to 1879 but lucky for the United States after that time period

92
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:22,855
After it recovered from the depression (at a super fast rate) in one of the fastest economic

93
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,522
growths in US history

94
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:28,073
You had this huge influx of immigrants

95
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:35,240
Tens of millions from Europe and by 1890 the United States was

96
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,355
now the richest country in the world on a per capita basis

97
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:42,788
which was amazing! Because only 100 years ago it was kind of this colony of Great Britain

98
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:45,271
or part of the British Empire

99
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:50,339
It was kind of this thing that the European powers did not view as having relevance to them

100
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,307
but now it was the richest country in the world

101
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:58,721
And then you fast forward to 1898 and it starts to essentially become

102
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,889
a bit of an empire

103
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,522
Until this time the United States kind of kept to itself it wasn't really interested in

104
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,722
controlling other nations or other people

105
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:15,191
But in 1898 you had this constant (Until 1898 Cuba was a Spanish colony

106
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:20,390
and there had been many revolts tried against the Spanish by the Cubans

107
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,339
and the United States was fairly sympathetic to the Cubans plight

108
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:28,907
They were another country in the New world trying to hold their own against a European power

109
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:33,472
and the Spanish were fairly infamous for cracking down on their subjects pretty hard

110
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:39,889
and so in 1898 during the revolt against the Spanish the US sent some

111
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:46,240
ships over to Havana harbour to essentially protect American interests

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,456
This might resonate a little bit to the Mexican American War where we kind of sent things close to

113
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:58,522
another country to protect our own interests and make sure that nothing outrageous occurs

114
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:07,621
While in Havana Harbour you have an American battleship called the Maine

115
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:12,239
That explodes and sinks

116
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,505
and this is an actual picture of it

117
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:17,039
This is fun because we are entering the point in history when pictures start to become relevant

118
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,356
although even in the mid eighteen sixties you had pictures

119
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:21,625
That's a picture of Abraham Lincoln

120
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:26,766
The Maine gets sunk, the people who want to declare war on Spain

121
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:32,836
say Hey Spain must have blown up the Maine (although this is still a complete mystery on the actual cause;

122
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:39,289
some say that it was a random explosion, some even cite conspiracies that would allow the US to justify

123
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:45,888
entering the war while some say that Spain did it for whatever reason

124
00:08:45,888 --> 00:08:50,289
It did not like this American fleet in Havana Harbour)

125
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:57,140
Regardless to say after it happened it made the Amercian public angry

126
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,771
The American government angry and they declared a very short lived war on Spain

127
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:03,622
They won prettyhandedly

128
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:07,852
The big takeaway from the Spanish-American War is that the US essentially became and empire

129
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,589
and started to have control of othe countries

130
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:17,823
Such as its temporary control of Cuba, it also (because it won) it got control of Guam which is right

131
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,171
over there

132
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,538
It still has control of Guam

133
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:27,622
It also got control of the Phillipines from Spain

134
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:34,455
and it maintained control of the Phillipines until the end of World War II

135
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:38,889
It also got control of Puerto Rico which is still part of the US though not as an offical state

136
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,172
it is US territory

137
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:51,855
At this point the US becomes an empire and then you fast forward ot 1914 war breaks out in Europe

138
00:09:51,855 --> 00:09:59,389
I need to do a whole series fo videos on World War One

139
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,789
But war breaks out in Europe, particularly the two strongest powers that are really at each other in

140
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,240
this time period are the British Empire and Germany

141
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,439
You have this situation where the US is trying its hardest to avoid war and sustain neutrality

142
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:19,089
Obviously the American people were predominantly of English decsent and were from English speaking countries

143
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,974
So there were some sympathies for the British Empire for Great Britain

144
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:31,839
But they wanted to stay neutral, however what happened was that the British had a blockade of the Germans

145
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,490
They had a kind of stranglehold. The Germans wanted to have a blockade of the British

146
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:45,556
As Great Britain was an island, it oculd really maybe win the war because it could somehow strangle the

147
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:49,205
island, if it could blockade the island. But unfortunately for Germany

148
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:53,105
it did not have a navy that was as strong

149
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:56,490
So you get close to 1917 actually 1915,16,17

150
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,856
Germany starts to get desperate so it sends its submarines (U-boats) into the Atlantic

151
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:08,000
So they say that if we cannot blockade Great Britain we can at least start harrasing or even blowing

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,450
ships up that are trying to trade with Great Britain in order to create fear

153
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,000
and have the equivalent of a blockade

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,967
At first Germany does some minor things.

155
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,233
As the war goes on however it becomes more and more desperate

156
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:29,816
and it starts to attack civilian ships, cruise liners, American starts dying becasue these

157
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,517
U-boats are just willy-nilly torpedoeing ships

158
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:39,750
The US doesn't tolerate this anymore and after the Zimmerman Telegram they enter the war

159
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,283
in 1917

160
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:46,533
Germany did not take the US that seriously at that point but they learned that they should have

161
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:52,483
And then you fast forward to 1918 when the US was definetly one of the major powers

162
00:11:52,483 --> 00:12:00,852
They really turned the tide and become a large power after their involvment in the war.

163
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,032
And then you fast forward to 1918 and the war ends

164
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:15,250
And the real takeaway from this is that it ended some of the nations that were on the losing end

165
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,500
Austria and Hungary no longer stayed a nation

166
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,115
The Ottoman Empire was no longer a nation in this form

167
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:27,799
As we will learn later there were huge reparations by the victors on Germany

168
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,466
That to a large degree may have lead to World War Two

169
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:40,909
The other things that started to happen at this point in 1920 you have the 18th and the 19th

170
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,651
ammendments being passed

171
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:46,017
The 18th enacted prohibition where all of a sudden you made

172
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:52,213
alcohol illegal in the US. And the irony of this is that this is when you have all of these movies

173
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:59,113
about bootleggers and this whole crime scene that develops around illegal alcohol

174
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:10,197
The 19th ammendment was a little less controversial. It finally gave women the right to vote

175
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:18,330
And one of the arguments against women having the right to vote was

176
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:25,432
only men are fighting for the country and only they have the right to vote and be soldiers

177
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:35,730
But during World War One worldwide so many men were fighting that women had to take up the slack at a

178
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,996
domestic level and in essence they had to become a big part of the war effort in terms of

179
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,390
working in the factories and producing things

180
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,581
and so that was probably one of the things that on a global scale women started to attain the right to

181
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:58,015
vote. Also during this period in the 1920's you have another post-war economic boom

182
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:03,231
that really develops into a post-war economic bubble until 1929

183
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:08,764
and then you have the stock market crash and I think some of us know that after that period

184
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,631
The Great Depression Ensues

185
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:20,808
It was a global great depression that contiues all the way until the US enters world was II
