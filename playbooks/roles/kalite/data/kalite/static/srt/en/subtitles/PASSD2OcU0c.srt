00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,010
Welcome to the presentation on more advanced ratio problems.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,230
Let's get started with some problems.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,860
So let's say that I have a class, and then-- oh the pen is

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,170
messed up --OK, so in the class the total number of

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:21,830
students is fifty-seven.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,840
And I would also tell you that the ratio of girls

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:34,450
to boys is equal to four:fifteen.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,420
So now this the interesting part, so far it

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,520
doesn't look to tough.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,450
My question is how many boys need to leave the room, so how

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:01:02,750
many boys need to leave for the ratio of girls to

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:10,940
boys to be four:eleven.

13
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,580
This is fascinating.

14
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,090
So, a good place to start is just to figure out how many

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,440
girls and how many boys there are in this classroom.

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,640
And we already learned how to do that in the introduction

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,120
to ratio problems.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,130
We know that the girls plus the boys is equal to fifty-seven, right,

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,540
because there are fifty-seven kids in the room.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,800
And we also know, just multiplying-- taking this

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,400
equation --and multiplying both sides by b, we also know that

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,020
the girls are equal to four / fifteen times the boys, right?

23
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,040
And then we can just substitute that back into this equation,

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:58,180
and then we get four / fifteenb plus b is equal to fifty-seven, is the same thing

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,100
as nineteen / fifteenb is equal to fifty-seven.

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,200
Let me clean this up a little bit.

27
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,620
That's separate, and then let me go here.

28
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:23,800
And we say b is equal to fifty-seven-- oh, woops --it's actually fifty-seven

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,920
times fifteen all of that over nineteen, right?

30
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,430
I just multiply both sides by fifteen / nineteen.

31
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,250
So fifty-seven divided by nineteen is three.

32
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,510
So b is equal to forty-five.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,230
And we know there're a total of fifty-seven kids in the class-- g plus

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,210
b is fifty-seven --so we know that there are twelve girls, right?

35
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,360
fifty-seven minus forty-five.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,110
Good.

37
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,230
So now we know that the current boys and girls

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,840
are forty-five boys and twelve girls.

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,860
So let's write that down.

40
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:07,520
So there's twelve girls and forty-five boys.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, the question says, how many boys need to leave for

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,540
the ratio of girls to boys equals four four:eleven?

43
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,680
So this is the number of girls right now, twelve,

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,150
this is the number boys.

45
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,760
Let's say x is a number of boys that need to leave the room.

46
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,940
So if x boys leave the room the new ratio will be twelve girls to

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,710
the forty-five boys minus the x boys that leave, right?

48
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,480
If that confuses you, sit and look at that for a second.

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,000
We start off with twelve girls and forty-five boys in the room.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,250
And we're saying x boys are going to leave, so the new

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,810
ratio is going to be twelve:forty-five minus x.

52
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,080
And we know from this part of the problem that that new

53
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,410
ratio is going to equal four:eleven.

54
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,110
There, we just set up a equation with one unknown

55
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,050
and we can solve for x.

56
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,120
I hope that doesn't confuse you much.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,080
All we did is we figured out how many boys, how many

58
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,370
girls are in the room now.

59
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,890
We said x is the number boys that need to leave.

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,770
And we said the new ratio is going to be girls to the new

61
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,270
number of boys, which is forty-five minus x, and that's going to

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,400
be equal to the new ratio.

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,060
So let's solve for x.

64
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:19,220
Well, twelve times eleven is what that's one hundred and thirty-two.

65
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:30,490
one hundred and thirty-two is equal to four times forty-five, one hundred and sixty, one hundred and eighty, minus fourx.

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,310
And then if you solve for x, I think you know how to do this

67
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:42,250
right now, and we can say minus fourx is equal to minus forty-eight.

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,880
x is equal to twelve.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,800
There we solved it.

70
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,950
So we say that if twelve boys left the room, the new ratio of

71
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,420
girls to boys would be four:eleven.

72
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,610
And does that make sense?

73
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,800
Well if twelve boys left the room, then the new ratio of girls to

74
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:03,430
boys would be twelve:thirty-three, right?

75
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,610
Because forty-five minus twelve is thirty-three.

76
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,860
And that's the same thing as if you divide the

77
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,010
top and bottom by three.

78
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,920
That's four:eleven.

79
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,140
So there, we got it right.

80
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,190
So what looked like a very hard problem actually wasn't so bad

81
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,930
when you just sit down and work through the algebra.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's do another problem.

83
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:35,470
Let's say --this thing sometimes malfunctions --OK,

84
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,620
let's say that the ratio of apples to bananas in a

85
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,540
basket is equal to five:nineteen.

86
00:05:46,550 --> 00:06:03,160
And when we add twenty-three bananas the ratio of apples to bananas--

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,320
and actually let's write it right now, we now have twenty-three

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:17,360
bananas more --is equal to ten:sixty-one.

89
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,810
So the question is, what is the total amount of

90
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,720
fruit in the basket?

91
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:33,000
Amount of fruit-- --ah, that's so messy --after

92
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,800
adding the bananas.

93
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,770
So I actually gave you a hint just when I wrote

94
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,690
down initial problem.

95
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,560
We're saying the ratio of a to b-- so let a equal the number

96
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,690
of apples, and b equal the number bananas --so the ratio

97
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,440
of apples to bananas equals five:nineteen.

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,060
When I add twenty-three bananas, now the new ratio's going to be the

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,440
number of apples to b plus twenty-three.

100
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,590
The new ratio is ten:sixty-one.

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,530
So how do we solve this?

102
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,070
Well, once again we have two equations and two unknowns.

103
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,620
We know that-- I guess let's take this equation first,

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:18,180
because it's a little more complicated --we know if we

105
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:32,870
cross multiply that sixty-onea is equal to tenb plus two hundred and thirty and if we

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,970
divide both sides by sixty-one, we know that a is equal to

107
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:45,820
ten / sixty-oneb plus two hundred and thirty / sixty-one.

108
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,660
Right?

109
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,060
And we could take this equation and multiply both sides by b

110
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,840
and we could say that a is equal to five / nineteenb.

111
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,800
Right?

112
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,430
Well both of these are equal to a so we could set them

113
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,790
equal to each other.

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:24,550
And you get five / nineteenb is equal to ten / sixty-oneb plus two hundred and thirty times sixty-one.

115
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,060
And we solve for b.

116
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,620
While this might seem complicated to you at first,

117
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,100
but it's just a basic linear equation.

118
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,100
And for the sake of time, because I only have two minutes

119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,960
left in this youtube.

120
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,490
I'm just going to solve for b, and you get b is equal to thirty-eight.

121
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,700
if b is equal to thirty-eight, we know that the initial ratio is five:nineteen.

122
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,610
So that's pretty easy.

123
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:53,240
We just say a is equal to five / nineteen times thirty-eight is equal to ten.

124
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,530
So the initial number of apples was ten, the initial number

125
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,830
bananas is thirty-eight, right?

126
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,410
So initially we started off with forty-eight pieces of fruit, and

127
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,160
then we're going to add twenty-three more pieces of fruit, right?

128
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,650
And forty-three plus twenty-eight, that's what, seventy-one pieces of fruit.

129
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,240
So, let me review real quick what we said.

130
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,420
We said the ratio of apples to bananas is five:nineteen.

131
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,980
That's a is the number of apples, b is the

132
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,370
number of bananas.

133
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,460
When I add twenty-three bananas, I now have b plus twenty-three bananas, the

134
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,510
new ratio of apples to total number bananas is ten:sixty-one.

135
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,690
And I just used both of these equations.

136
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,600
Two equations and two unknowns.

137
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,830
Solved for a, and then substituted, and

138
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,910
I solved for b.

139
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,730
Nothing fancy here.

140
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,110
I know there's a lot of fractions here, but if you

141
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,760
just work through this, the fractions actually work out.

142
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,740
And I was able to solve for a and b.

143
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,120
Add the twenty-three pieces and I got seventy-one total pieces of fruit.

144
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,190
I think you're now ready to try some of the more

145
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,970
difficult ratio problems.

146
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,480
Have fun!
