1
00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:04,116
Let's return to our fairly simple banking example,

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:07,471
and see if we can use it to actually understand

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:10,301
or at least get a better idea of what money is

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,635
and how it's created.

5
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:16,063
so in the original example, I said, I have this idea.

6
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:20,213
I have all of these farmers who, at the end of the season,

7
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,172
they sell all of their apples--

8
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:26,497
let's say that's the main cash crop on our island.

9
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,897
And then every year they just have this--

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:31,970
collectively they have-- I'll just make up a number--

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,718
1,000 gold pieces that they get.

12
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:38,429
Or at least this year, I'll call it 1,000 gold.

13
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,737
They have 1,000 gold coins that they get

14
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:40,698
at the end of the year.

15
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:43,182
Normally the farmers just kind of stash it under their mattresses

16
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:47,583
or dig up a hole and put it there.

17
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,758
And I said, boy, what a waste,

18
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,294
because there are actually good projects out there that people could--

19
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:57,656
maybe irrigation ditches, factories, a tool factory, anything else.

20
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,925
But there's just no money for those people

21
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,452
to build those things.

22
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:06,117
If only somehow I could take this money and use it for those projects,

23
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,492
then we would actually create wealth.

24
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,236
We'd have innovation.

25
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,471
And our entire pie would get bigger.

26
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,623
So what I do is, I start up this bank.

27
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:17,695
And I'll do it all over again, just like I did last time.

28
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:23,106
Let's say that I personally had 100 gold pieces.

29
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:25,064
I'm going to stick with gold,

30
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:27,592
because I want to show you how the money creation--

31
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:30,438
there is a small multiplier effect even when you're using gold.

32
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,481
Some people think it only happens with paper money.

33
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:36,474
This is all a byproduct of the fractional reserve system,

34
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,653
which was essentially what I showed you

35
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:39,755
in the last two videos.

36
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:41,241
Let's just go through the whole example.

37
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,179
So I take 100 gold pieces,

38
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:48,610
and I construct this nice vault looking building.

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,322
So this is real estate, or building.

40
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,680
And it's worth 100 gold.

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,575
These are my assets.

42
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,885
Assets on the left-hand side,

43
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,312
liabilities on the right-hand side.

44
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:02,187
And then I go tell all of these farmers,

45
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,943
one, your money's not safe there.

46
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:07,209
If you actually keep it as a deposit in my nice looking building

47
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,517
I will give you interest on it.

48
00:02:08,517 --> 00:02:10,058
So those farmers say, great idea.

49
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:12,633
So they all deposit their 1,000 gold pieces

50
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,545
into my bank.

51
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:16,218
So now I have this liability.

52
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:19,541
I have 1,000 gold pieces liability.

53
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,877
And why is it a liability?

54
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:22,592
Because I owe it to the farmers.

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,188
At some point in the future,

56
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,697
they're going to come back to me and say,

57
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:27,365
hey, you know that gold I gave you, I want it back.

58
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,755
So it's a liability to me.

59
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,898
But it's also an asset on my side, right?

60
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:32,328
But my whole business model is,

61
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,817
I wanted to put this to work.

62
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,043
So what I do is, I put some aside.

63
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:38,281
So essentially, I make some reserves.

64
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,859
I'll do the reserves in red,

65
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,256
because we're going to want to pay attention to them later.

66
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:46,521
Let's say I put 10% aside.

67
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:50,420
So I put 100 gold pieces aside.

68
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,500
And I do that in case any of those farmers,

69
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,596
the next day or the next week, come to me and say,

70
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:57,219
oh, you know what, I actually need my money.

71
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:02,352
My son needs a haircut, or whatever the need might be.

72
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,871
But anyway, I put 100 gold pieces aside as reserves.

73
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:11,946
And then the remainder-- this 900 gold pieces-- I lend out.

74
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:12,985
Let me do that in a different color.

75
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,407
I'll do it in green.

76
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,481
900 gold pieces I lend out.

77
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:18,939
So it's an asset.

78
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:20,390
But the gold is gone.

79
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,545
I take that gold-- remember, I had 1,000 gold pieces come in--

80
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,121
I kept 100 of it.

81
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,423
And now I'm going to lend it to someone

82
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,973
who has a really good project.

83
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,913
Normally, you would lend it to a bunch of people.

84
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,178
But for the sake of simplicity,

85
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:39,384
let's say I lend it to someone who has an irrigation project.

86
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:42,919
He's going to take that 900 gold pieces and pay a bunch of people,

87
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,568
who are probably not doing anything anymore

88
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:48,419
because the apple crop has been harvested and sold,

89
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:51,231
and they're going to build an irrigation canal

90
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:56,639
so that more land is usable to make more apples the next year. soon.

91
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,975
And I say that's a great investment

92
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:59,824
because they're going to make more apples,

93
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,470
or they're going to sell the water to the farmers.

94
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,702
And they should be able to pay some interest to me.

95
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,923
So I give my 900 gold pieces to them

96
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:11,317
to essentially dig these ditches.

97
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,851
Well, the 900 gold pieces, that then goes to the workers.

98
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,664
The borrower borrowed them,

99
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,472
and then paid it to the workers.

100
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:23,046
900 gold goes to the workers.

101
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,293
And so after the project is done,

102
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:29,429
you have a bunch of workers with 900 gold pieces.

103
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,747
Well, these workers, they're just like the farmers.

104
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,537
They say, well, I don't want to put it in my bed.

105
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,094
And I want to get interest on it.

106
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:37,503
It's not safe inside my house.

107
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,716
So, let's say that my bank is the only game in town.

108
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,736
So they go back to my bank.

109
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,095
And they say, hey, Bank of Sal,

110
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,454
I want to deposit my money with you.

111
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,671
I say, great.

112
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:50,872
So what I do is, I take their 900 gold pieces,

113
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:52,664
and I take it as a deposit.

114
00:04:52,664 --> 00:04:59,436
Let me try to draw that as a deposit.

115
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:07,155
If this is 1,000, 900 might be about that.

116
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,833
So this is the farmers' deposits.

117
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,783
That was the initial money.

118
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:16,340
So then I get the 900 gold pieces from the workers.

119
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,070
I want to make this as neat as possible.

120
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,054
I didn't want to go through the pain of having multiple banks

121
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,069
because you could do this with just one bank.

122
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:24,921
Maybe in a future video, I'll do it with multiple banks,

123
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:26,294
just to show you that all the deposits

124
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:27,824
don't have to go to one place.

125
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,020
But it's the same idea.

126
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,402
Anyway, these 900 gold pieces are essentially deposited back

127
00:05:31,402 --> 00:05:34,738
into my bank for safekeeping.

128
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:37,301
And I say, boy, I don't need to keep

129
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:42,033
all of these 900 gold pieces here.

130
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,649
I could lend it out again for some useful project.

131
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,781
So once again, I say, well, these are demand deposits,

132
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,883
which means that these farmers could demand them at any time.

133
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:53,365
So let me put a little bit aside.

134
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,623
I know statistically that no more than maybe 10% of them

135
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,028
will come to the given days.

136
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,203
So let me set aside 10% of that.

137
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:02,561
So I'll once again have 10% reserves.

138
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:08,364
So I'll set aside 90 gold pieces.

139
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:14,445
And then the other-- let me do that in the lending color--

140
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:22,567
the other 810 gold pieces I lend out.

141
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,874
And let's say I lend it out to some entrepreneur.

142
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,568
Remember, I'm getting interest on all of this.

143
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:28,210
But we're not concerned with the interest right now,

144
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,825
we're concerned with the money supply.

145
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:34,766
So I lend it out to some guy who wants to build a factory,

146
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:36,661
build a factory for cutting tools.

147
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,596
That'll help all of us become more productive

148
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,073
when we have to harvest our apples,

149
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,808
or maybe even digging the ditches.

150
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:47,438
Build factory

151
00:06:47,438 --> 00:06:52,024
So once again, this 810 gold pieces,

152
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:55,856
they're going to go to the construction workers or the contractors

153
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,200
who built the factory.

154
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,373
So let's call it factory contractors,

155
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:07,873
the people who build the factory.

156
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:11,027
Once again, now they have 810 gold pieces.

157
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,834
And they're like, I don't like keeping it in my house.

158
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,172
There's that nice fancy vault that Sal has,

159
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,641
and he gives interest on it.

160
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,974
So they take those 810 gold pieces,

161
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:29,800
and they deposit it in my bank.

162
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,582
And then, let's just say that I could just continue this process,

163
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:35,824
so forth and so on.

164
00:07:35,824 --> 00:07:38,905
And just so you know, it doesn't go infinitely.

165
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,521
Because every step of the way,

166
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,839
we' re having a little bit less.

167
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,116
I'll do the fancier math on how to figure out

168
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,690
how many steps we can do.

169
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,220
Let's just stop it there, just for the sake of brevity,

170
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,125
and just so I you don't run out of space on this.

171
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,758
So they take 810 gold pieces, and I for the most part

172
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,788
feel that I've lent enough money out there.

173
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:03,692
So I keep all of this 810 gold pieces as reserves.

174
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,780
So I don't lend that out, although I could.

175
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,600
I could just set aside 10% of it, 81 gold pieces,

176
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,567
and then lend the rest of it out.

177
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,839
But I don't do that.

178
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,201
I just keep all of those 810 gold pieces as reserve.

179
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,614
So this is my balance sheet.

180
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,163
Maybe if these transactions occur all at once,

181
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:22,559
over the course of the year,

182
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,302
this is what the Bank of Sal's balance sheet looks like.

183
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:28,261
These are my assets, and these are my liabilities.

184
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:31,260
And notice, assets are still equal to

185
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,347
liabilities plus equity.

186
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,230
This was equity.

187
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,216
This is liabilities.

188
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,728
These are deposits that I owe to people.

189
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:47,237
Deposits equal liabilities from a bank's point of view.

190
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:50,395
They're assets for those people.

191
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:51,596
And then these are my assets.

192
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:53,855
Some of them are cash money, in magenta.

193
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:58,492
This 810, this 90, this 100, these are gold coins

194
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:01,347
that are sitting in my vault, so that's definitely an asset that I have.

195
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:04,718
And then these are loans that I lent-- at least, this and this--

196
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:06,357
these are loans that I lent out to somebody.

197
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:09,782
And that's as asset, as long as they pay me back.

198
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,817
So now, we have set it all up.

199
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,987
My question to you is, how much money is there

200
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:19,177
in the system or in our economy?

201
00:09:19,177 --> 00:09:22,455
So It all depends how you define money.

202
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:23,832
So let's make a definition.

203
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:29,572
Let's say I make a definition called m0.

204
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:32,184
And this is just, how much gold is there?

205
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:36,174
How much gold in the system?

206
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,620
Well, we can go and count it.

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,733
Remember, notice, all of the gold is being held in my bank.

208
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,204
So we just have to go to this one bank

209
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:43,300
and count how much gold it has.

210
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,735
It has 100 gold here, 90 gold here, 810 gold here.

211
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:53,955
So 810 plus 90 plus 100 is equal to 1,000 gold.

212
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:56,544
So there's 1,000 gold pieces.

213
00:09:56,544 --> 00:09:58,047
And that makes sense, right,

214
00:09:58,047 --> 00:10:00,533
because we had 1,000 gold pieces to begin with.

215
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:05,661
And we didn't mine for any new gold,

216
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:09,217
or we didn't use any lodestones to turn lead into gold, or anything like that.

217
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:13,056
We just had the original 1,000 gold pieces.

218
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:14,526
And there's no way to create more.

219
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,782
They don't reproduce on their own.

220
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,204
So we still have 1,000 gold pieces.

221
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,532
And we can view that as our narrowest definition

222
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,527
of the money supply.

223
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:24,507
Let's say another definition.

224
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:27,770
Let's call this m1.

225
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,394
And I'm running out of time.

226
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:33,574
And that is, how much money do people think they have,

227
00:10:33,574 --> 00:10:37,365
in terms of their checking accounts?

228
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:40,274
Well, the farmers think that they have 1,000 gold pieces.

229
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,803
The original ditch construction workers think

230
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,566
they have 900.

231
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:48,023
And then the factory builders think they have 810.

232
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,229
So if you add them, it's 1,000 plus 900 plus 810.

233
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:59,718
Let's see, that's 1,900-- that's 2,710 gold pieces.

234
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:03,344
So if you went and surveyed everyone in the city

235
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,766
and you said, how much do you keep in your checking accounts?

236
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,448
Or how much you have on demand deposits in a bank?

237
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:15,160
If you added up all of those numbers, you would have 2,710 gold pieces,

238
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,662
if I added my numbers correctly.

239
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:19,605
This is the multiplier effect.

240
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:23,369
This happens whenever you have a fractional reserve system.

241
00:11:23,369 --> 00:11:25,501
And this is what people say

242
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,206
when they talk about the money supply.

243
00:11:28,206 --> 00:11:30,141
It depends how you measured--and this is what people talk about

244
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,586
when they talk about money being created.

245
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:36,185
We had 1,000 gold coins, but because of this multiplier effect,

246
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:41,168
people think that there are 2,710 gold pieces.

247
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,971
In the next video, I'll address the issue of

248
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,277
whether they are correct to think this.

249
00:11:45,277 --> 99:59:59,999
See you soon.
