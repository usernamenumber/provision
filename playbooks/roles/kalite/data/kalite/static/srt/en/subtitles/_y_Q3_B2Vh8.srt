1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:03,588
Now we mixed up things a little bit more:

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:07,466
on the left side of the scale,
not only do we have

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:11,487
these identical unknown masses with mass X,
these three blue things,

4
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:14,087
we also have some of the 1kg masses
over here,

5
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:16,498
actually, we have two of them.

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,588
Now, we are going to figure out wat X is.

7
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:22,687
But before we even do that, I want you to think about a mathematical equation

8
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:27,554
that can represent what is going on;
that equates what we have on the left hand,

9
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:31,620
with what we have on the right side of the scale.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,354
I will give you a few seconds to think about it...

11
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,620
So let's think about what we have on the left side:

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:46,020
we have 3 masses with mass X, so you can say
we have 3x

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,154
and then we have 2 masses of 1 kilogram,
so in total we have 2 kg. So + 2.

14
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:57,354
So one way to think about the total mass on the left-hand side is 3x + 2.

15
00:00:57,354 --> 00:01:00,848
Three masses with mass X,
plus two kilograms.

16
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,938
That is what we have on the left-hand side.

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,585
Now, let us think about what we have on the right-hand side.

18
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,154
We can simply count them:

19
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:11,855
[counts to 14]

20
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:19,220
Fourteen blocks, each has a mass of 1 kg,
so the total mass will be 14 kg.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,620
And we see that the scale is balanced, not tilting down or upwards.

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,666
So this mass over here must be equal to this total mass.

23
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,087
The scale is balanced,
so we can write an 'equal'-sign.

24
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,220
(let me do that in a white coulour,
I do not like that brown)

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,258
Now, what I want you to think about,

26
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:44,890
and you can think about it either through the symbols or through the scales, is:

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,104
how would you go about --
let us think about a few things:

28
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:54,090
how would you first go about at least getting rid of these little 1kg blocks?

29
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,557
I will give you a second to think about that...

30
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:01,107
Well, the simpelest thing is:

31
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:03,940
you can take these 1kg blocks off of the left-hand side,

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,098
but remember, if you just took these blocks off of the left-hand side,

33
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:10,357
and it was balanced before,
now the left-hand side will be lighter

34
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:13,757
and it will move up. But we want to keep it balanced so we can keep saying 'equal'.

35
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:16,107
That this mass is equal to that mass.

36
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:21,490
So, if we remove 2 block from the left-hand side,
we need to remove 2 from the right-hand side.

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,490
So, we can remove two there,
and then we can remove two over there.

38
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,340
Mathematically, what we are doing is:
we are subtracting 2 kilograms from each side.

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,157
We are subtracting 2 from this side,

40
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:38,909
So on the left-hand side we now have
3x + 2, minus 2

41
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,624
we are left with just 3x,

42
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:47,557
and on the right-hand side we had 14 and we took away 2 (let me write this:)

43
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:53,023
we took away 2, so we are going to be left with 12 blocks.

44
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:56,423
And you see that there, the ones that I have not crossed out, there are 12 left,

45
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:58,957
and here you have 3 of those X-blocks.

46
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:02,361
Since we removed the same amount from both sides,

47
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:08,357
our scale is still balanced. And our equation:
3x is now equal to 12.

48
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:12,690
Now, this turns into a problem very similar to what we saw in the last video,

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,083
so now I ask you: what can we do to isolate one x,

50
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,428
to only have one 'X' on the left-hand side of the scale,

51
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,552
while keeping the scale balanced?

52
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:30,629
The easiest way to think about it is:

53
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,154
If I want one X on this left-hand side, that is a third of the total X's here.

54
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:38,963
So what if I were to multiply the left-hand side by one-third --

55
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:43,745
-- but if I want to keep the scale balanced,
I have to multiply the right-hand side by one-third.

56
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,229
If we can do that mathematically,

57
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,563
Over here I can multiply the left-hand side by 1/3,

58
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:55,163
and if I want to keep my scale balanced I also have to multiply the right-hand side by 1/3.

59
00:03:55,163 --> 00:04:00,563
Multiplying it physically literally means: just keeping a third of what we had originally

60
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:03,896
We would get rid of two of these.

61
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:06,029
If we want to keep a third of what we had here originally,

62
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:08,896
-- there are 12 blocks left over after removing those first two --

63
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:15,429
so, 1/3 of 12: we are only going to have four of these little 1kg boxes left.

64
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:21,363
Let me remove all but four.
(so, remove those, and those...)

65
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:24,659
And I have left [counts them] 4 here.

66
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,563
And so, what you are left with,
the only thing you have left,

67
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:32,554
is this 'X' - I will shade it in to show this is the one we actually have left -

68
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:37,058
and then we have these 1 kilogram boxes.

69
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:40,866
You see it mathematically over here:
1/3 * 3x

70
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:45,763
-- or you could have said 3x divided by 3 --
either way, that gives us

71
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:49,736
-- these threes cancel out, so that would give you an 'X'

72
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:56,633
and on the right-hand side: 12 * 1/3 - which is the same as 12/3, is equal to 4.

73
00:04:56,633 --> 00:05:02,600
And, since we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,894
So you see that the mass of this thing must be the same as the mass of these 4 left-over blocks.

75
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,829
x must be equal to 4 kilograms.
