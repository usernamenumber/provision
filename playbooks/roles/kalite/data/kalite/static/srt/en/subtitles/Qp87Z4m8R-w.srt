1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,670
All of the phase changes we've
been doing so far have been

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,980
under constant pressure
conditions, and, in

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,940
particular, with the problems
that I've been doing with

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,480
water phase changes in the last
couple of videos, it was

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,330
at atmospheric pressure, at
least at sea level atmospheric

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,860
pressure, or at 1 atmosphere.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,290
So it was done-- well,
I'll explain this

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,450
diagram in a second.

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,140
But we all know that in the
universe, pressure isn't

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,190
always constant and it
definitely isn't always

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,460
constant at 1 atmosphere.

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,060
1 atmosphere was defined
as the pressure at

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,080
sea level on Earth.

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,320
Obviously, pressure will vary
wildly if you go to smaller

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,460
planets or larger planets, or
have thicker atmospheres, or

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,640
if we're just doing different
types of applications dealing

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,660
with gases and liquids
and solids.

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,460
So what I've drawn here
is a phase diagram.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,710
Let me write that down.

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,480
   

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,930
And there are many forms of
phase diagrams. This is the

23
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,480
most common form that you might
see in your chemistry

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,200
class or on some standardized
test, but what it captures is

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,240
the different states of matter
and when they transition

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,590
according to temperature
and pressure.

27
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,010
This is the phase diagram
for water.

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,870
So just to understand what's
going on here, is that on this

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,485
axis, I have pressure.

30
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,520
   

31
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,630
On the x-axis, I have
temperature, and at any given

32
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,650
point, this diagram will tell
you whether you're dealing

33
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,690
with a solid, so solid will
be here, a liquid will

34
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:34,160
be here, or a gas.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:42,160
For example, if I told you that
I was at 0 degrees, let's

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,340
say 0 degrees is right there,
if I'm at 0 degrees Celsius

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,820
and 1 atmosphere, where am I?

38
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,400
So 0 degrees, 1 atmosphere,
I'm right at

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,710
that point right there.

40
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,000
So I'm at a boundary point
between solids and liquids at

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,770
1 atmosphere of pressure,
right?

42
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,550
This is when we're at 1
atmosphere of pressure.

43
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,350
So this coincides with our
traditional notion of when ice

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,979
freezes or when it melts
at 0 degrees.

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,290
If we made the pressure
higher, what happens?

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,340
Well, then ice starts melting at
a lower temperature, right?

47
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,990
So this is pressure going up,
so pressure going up, let's

48
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,400
say-- I don't know
what this is.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,290
This is maybe 10 atmospheres,
ten times Earth's atmospheric

50
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,550
pressure at sea level, then
all of a sudden, the

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,670
temperature at which solid
turns into liquid-- this

52
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,750
transition is solid to liquid
--the temperature at which

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,790
that happens will go down.

54
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,480
Likewise, if we lower the
pressure, if we go to Denver

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,820
and it's a mile high, pressure
is lower because we have less

56
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,080
of the atmosphere above us,
then all of a sudden, the

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,990
freezing point increases, so
the freezing point will be

58
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,020
something above 1 degree.

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,520
This isn't drawn completely to
scale, but the idea is your

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,610
ice would actually freeze a
little bit faster and would

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,740
freeze at a higher temperature
in Denver than it would at the

62
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,840
bottom of the Dead Sea or in
Death Valley at some below sea

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,210
level point on the planet.

64
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,550
Now, this transition is
the transition between

65
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,230
anything and gas.

66
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,820
And we're very familiar,
this is 1 atmosphere.

67
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,790
And remember, this is water
we're dealing with.

68
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,520
This is the diagram for water,
so at 1 atmosphere, this is

69
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,530
kind of the stuff that
we're used to seeing.

70
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,910
Let me draw a line here.

71
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:41,430
So at 1 atmosphere, 0 degrees is
where solid, or ice, turns

72
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,780
into liquid water.

73
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,670
And then we go up here, so we
keep going at a higher,

74
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,680
higher, higher temperature, and
then here, this would be,

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,550
since we're at 1 atmosphere,
this is 100 degrees Celsius

76
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,480
right there.

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,500
And that's the point at 1
atmosphere of pressure where

78
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,850
liquid turns into gas,
or water vaporizes,

79
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,030
or the liquid boils.

80
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,020
All of those are acceptable
ways to think about that.

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,760
But what happens when we
go to low pressure?

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Once again, let's take our
little trip to Denver.

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,740
So that's Denver right there.

84
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,970
It's not that drastic.

85
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm just doing that for
education purposes.

86
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,030
Or even better, let's say Mount
Everest. Mount Everest,

87
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,400
very low pressure there.

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,120
Then our freezing point, we
already said that goes up when

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
you lower the pressure, and your
boiling point goes down,

90
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,040
so it's much easier to boil
something on the top of Mount

91
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,870
Everest than it is to boil it at
the bottom or at the lowest

92
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,740
point in Death Valley
or the Dead Sea.

93
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,750
The intuition behind that is if
I have a liquid, a bunch of

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,770
molecules in liquid form, and
they're touching each other,

95
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,320
but they have enough kinetic
energy to move past each

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,660
other, so they're flowing past
each other, they're kind of

97
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,170
rubbing up against each other,
one of the reasons why they

98
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,620
don't just evaporate, why this
guy doesn't just jump up

99
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,910
there, is that there's
air above him.

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,500
There's air pressure.

101
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,570
And air pressure, we've
learned about this

102
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,980
when we did PV nRT.

103
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,430
That's a bunch of gas molecules,
and the pressure

104
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,130
they're creating is essentially
caused by their

105
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,660
temperature and their
kinetic energy.

106
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,290
And they sit there, and they
bounce, and they essentially

107
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,570
keep these heavier molecules
from going up.

108
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,260
They keep them from essentially
separating from

109
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,610
each other and turning
into a gas.

110
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,380
So the more pressure you have,
the harder it is for these

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,250
guys to escape.

112
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,280
On the other hand, if we're in
a vacuum, if we're doing this

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,120
on the surface of the moon and
there's none of these guys

114
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,890
there, then just a little
slight bump.

115
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,710
Even though this guy's still a
little bit attracted to over

116
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,750
here, they're still attracted
to each other.

117
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,980
But just a little bit of bump,
since there's no pressure up

118
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,260
here on the surface of the moon,
might allow this guy to

119
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,840
escape and go straight
to a gas.

120
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,670
So when you lower the pressure,
it's just that much

121
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,190
easier to go from liquid to gas
or even from solid to gas.

122
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,670
And you might say, Sal,
that's a bizarre

123
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,960
concept, solid to gas.

124
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,260
It turns out, if you get to low
enough pressures here, I

125
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,650
mean, let's say this is--
Actually, there's probably not

126
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,020
stuff here.

127
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,980
This is probably close to
a vacuum right here.

128
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,000
You could go from ice-- So if
you took ice and you were on

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,120
the moon and you were at the
right temperature-- this is

130
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,800
maybe some negative degrees
Celsius temperature; I don't

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,210
know what the exact temperature
is --your ice on

132
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,280
the moon would go directly
from ice to a gas.

133
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,850
Because there's this huge
vacuum here, so these

134
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,520
molecules would say, hey,
there's all this space to fill

135
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,290
and if they just get bumped a
little bit, they're just going

136
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,230
to escape and turn into a gas.

137
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,880
You might say, oh, Sal, that's
a strange phenomenon.

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,380
It only exists on the moon.

139
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,450
And to rebut that comment, I've
drawn the phase diagram

140
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,700
for carbon dioxide.

141
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,260
   

142
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,150
It's all around you.

143
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,590
You're exhaling it
as we speak.

144
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,950
Your plants in the room are
hopefully inhaling it, but

145
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,900
carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere
has a very different behavior

146
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,930
than water.

147
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,600
This is carbon dioxide
at 1 atmosphere.

148
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,050
Just so you know, this
scale is definitely

149
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,020
not drawn to scale.

150
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,230
The difference between 1
atmosphere and 5 atmospheres

151
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,170
is not the same as between
5 atmospheres and 73.

152
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,530
Likewise, this is not
drawn to scale here.

153
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,680
This is a much larger
distance than this.

154
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,650
If I had to really draw it to
scale, I'd have to stretch

155
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,180
this chart out or do a

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,100
logarithmic chart or something.

157
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,030
But anyway, I was talking
about carbon dioxide.

158
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,340
So this is carbon dioxide solid,
and this is gas, and

159
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,880
this is liquid carbon dioxide.

160
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,120
So at 1 atmosphere, let's say
you live at sea level, like

161
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,605
you're in New Orleans, I guess
that's a little bit below sea

162
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:51,390
level-- that's where I grew up
--if you were able to get your

163
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,560
fridge down to minus 80 degrees
Celsius, the carbon

164
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,530
dioxide would actually freeze.

165
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,820
And you're actually not too
unfamiliar with that, or at

166
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,320
least you haven't been if you've
gone to some-- I don't

167
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,870
know if they still use it for
smoke machines or for visual

168
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,730
effects on stage, but
this is dry ice.

169
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,820
It's frozen carbon dioxide.

170
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,180
If you're at sea level
atmospheric pressure, as soon

171
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,890
as you get above this minus 78
and 1/2 degrees Celsius, it

172
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,990
sublimates to gas.

173
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,560
So that process, where you go
straight from a solid to a

174
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,810
gas, is sublimation.

175
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,260
   

176
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,929
And that's why dry ice, when
you see it, you don't see

177
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,000
liquid dry ice or you don't see
it at standard pressures.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,110
I've never seen liquid
carbon dioxide.

179
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,590
In fact, to get liquid carbon
dioxide, you have to get above

180
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,030
5 atmospheres so you have to get
above five times the sea

181
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,900
level pressure on Earth, and
you're really not going to see

182
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,670
that in natural conditions
on Earth.

183
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,740
You might see that on Jupiter
or Saturn where you have

184
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,330
tremendous pressures because of
the gravity and all of the

185
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,710
atmosphere above you.

186
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,680
Liquid carbon dioxide, you might
see-- I don't know if

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,630
Jupiter actually has carbon, but
you'll probably see it on

188
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,960
other huge massive planets
that are gas giants.

189
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,380
But on Earth, this process is
just called sublimation.

190
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,250
It's just a neat word.

191
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,740
Or it's sublimating.

192
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,460
It's going straight from solid
to gas and it's something

193
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,920
you've seen with dry ice.

194
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,820
Now, there's a couple other
interesting points here and

195
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,920
you're probably already
noticing them.

196
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,000
This right here is called the
triple point, because right

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,480
here at this-- Well, in the case
of carbon dioxide, at 5

198
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,130
atmospheres and minus 56 degrees
Celsius, the carbon

199
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,960
dioxide is in a state of
equilibrium between the ice,

200
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,540
the liquid and the gas.

201
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,330
It's a little bit of
all of the three.

202
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,030
And if you just nudge it in one
direction or another by

203
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,550
nudging the pressure
or the temperature,

204
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,450
it'll go in that direction.

205
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,600
Similarly, water's triple
point is right here.

206
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,380
It's at a much lower
pressure than we're

207
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,270
used to dealing with.

208
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:01,040
This is 0.611 kilopascals, or
just 611 pascals, which is

209
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,500
5/1000 of an atmosphere.

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,430
So if you go down to 5/1000 of
an atmosphere and you go a

211
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,750
little bit above 0 degrees
Celsius, you're at the triple

212
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,700
point of water.

213
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,210
where water can take on any of
these states if you just nudge

214
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,790
it in one direction
or another.

215
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,730
Now, the other interesting
point on these

216
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,680
charts is up here.

217
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,710
This is the critical point.

218
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,390
Sounds very important.

219
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,440
Critical point.

220
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,730
And that's the point at which
if you increase the

221
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,190
temperature beyond that or the
pressure beyond that, you're

222
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,140
dealing with a supercritical
fluid.

223
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,030
It sounds very exciting.

224
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:41,600
So above here, you have
a supercritical fluid.

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
So very high temperature,
very high pressure.

226
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,290
It's so high temperature that
it wants to be a gas, but

227
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,930
you're putting so much pressure
on it that it wants

228
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,060
to be a fluid, so it's
a little bit of both.

229
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,270
And actually, in the case of
water, supercritical water is

230
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,930
actually used as a solvent.

231
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,800
Because you can imagine, it's
kind of like liquid water in

232
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,210
that things can dissolve
in it, but it's so high

233
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,300
temperature and it can diffuse
into solids that it's really

234
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,440
good at just getting whatever
you want out of whatever

235
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,490
you're trying to clean or
somehow get into or get salt

236
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,850
put into the water.

237
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,450
So this is supercritical
fluid and it's a fun

238
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,190
thing to think about.

239
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,150
But anyway, I just wanted to
expose you to these phase

240
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,230
diagrams. Everything I've done
so far was at a constant

241
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,140
pressure and I changed the
temperature, but you can also

242
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,320
read them the other way.

243
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,530
If I'm at 100 degrees, and I go
from-- Well, let's say I'm

244
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,730
at 110 degrees, where at sea
level is comfortably in the

245
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,590
gaseous phase for-- So this
is 110 degrees for water.

246
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,650
It's water vapor.

247
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,890
But if I were to increase the
pressure and I keep increasing

248
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,730
the pressure and maybe I dig a
hole or something or I go into

249
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,120
the ocean, then it's going to
condense into water or it's

250
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,260
going to condense
into a liquid.

251
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:06,550
If I did that experiment here,
when I increase the pressure,

252
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm going to reverse
sublimate.

253
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,710
And I think I wrote down a
word for what that is.

254
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,980
Let me see if I wrote
it down someplace.

255
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,840
Oh, no, I didn't.

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,980
I didn't write it down.

257
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,210
But essentially it's something
like condense, but the word is

258
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,480
escaping me at the second.

259
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,770
It's something on the word of

260
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,520
condensing or falling together.

261
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,290
Anyway, I forget the word, but
it'll go straight from a gas

262
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,270
to a solid.

263
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,110
So these are pretty neat
diagrams. They actually tell a

264
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,830
lot about different substances
and then tell you what happens

265
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,450
when the pressure or the
temperature changes.
