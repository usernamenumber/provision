1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
All right, we are on problem number 17.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,330
I think my pen is too thick. There you go.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,030
We were on problem 17, and I think I did a good job of

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,680
confusing you at the end of the last video.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,680
So I'm going to, to some degree, start from scratch.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,070
So I've left what I drew last time where we had this graph

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,060
that they did on problem 17.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,080
And they said that this is the graph of y equals f of x.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,030
And they said, which of the following could be used to get

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,000
the graph of y is equal to f of x plus 2?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,140
So they want us to graph, essentially,

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,040
y is equal to f of x plus 2.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,540
And just so we don't get confused with the y's and stuff,

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,050
I'm going to define a new function called g of x.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,730
Hopefully this will not confuse you

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,050
and just simplify some things.

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,480
And I'll call it g of x is equal to f of x plus 2.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,050
And I did that because I didn't want 2 y's here.

19
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,040
I want you to realize that this is a different function,

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,580
and these aren't the same function or the same y.

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,910
So I'm going to define a new function called g of x

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
is equal to f of x plus 2.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,830
So first let's just write a little table that

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,620
maybe we can understand a little bit about f of x.

25
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,450
We know a couple things.

26
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,020
When x is 0, f of x is 1.

27
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,590
When x is 1, f of x is 0. We know that, right?

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:26,040
So let's do another table for g of x.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,020
So let's do x, g of x.

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,510
So now let's think about it in a slightly different,

31
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,090
almost in a reverse way.

32
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,000
We know a couple of values.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,030
We know what f of 0 is, right?

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,000
We know f of 0, and we know f of 1, right?

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,330
We're given it right here. We know f of 0 is equal to 1,

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,030
and we know f of 1 is equal to 0.

37
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,480
Now what value do I have to stick into g of x for

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,090
x to get f of 0?

39
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,080
Well I said g of x is equal to f of x plus 2, right?

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,030
So to get f of 0, I need to put a negative 2 in here.

41
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,850
g of negative 2 is equal to f of minus 2 plus two,

42
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,000
which equals f of 0, right?

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,010
So this is g of minus 2.

44
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,020
It's the same thing as f of 0.

45
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,570
And so x is just minus 2.

46
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,030
So when x is minus 2, g of x is equal to 1, right?

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,010
x is minus 2. g of minus 2 is the same thing as f of 0

48
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,060
because you get the minus 2 plus 2, and that equals one.

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,080
So there we go, g of minus 2 is equal to 1.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,060
Then what value do I have to put into g to get f of 1?

51
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,850
So what do I have to put here for this expression

52
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,350
right here to be equal to 1?

53
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:05,040
Well it has to equal negative 1, g of negative 1.

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,030
If you put negative 1 into g, you get negative 1 plus 2,

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,030
which is 1.

56
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,010
That's the same thing as f of 1, so that equals 0.

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,090
So when x is at negative 1, g of negative 1 is 0.

58
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,030
So let's draw g.

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,190
When x is equal to-- I'll draw it in this color--

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,560
when x is negative 2-- so this is negative 2--

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,790
we have g of x is equal to 1.

62
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,010
So this right here is a point.

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,020
So this is at negative 2, 0.

64
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,010
And then we also have the point negative 1, 0.

65
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,000
So we also have this point, negative 1, 0.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,020
Negative 1, 0 is that point.

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,690
And so we see what happened is,

68
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,520
is that g of x is actually a shift to the left by 2.

69
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,050
So g of x is going to look something like this.

70
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,990
It's going to look like the other graph,

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,010
just shifted to the left.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,440
Esstentially, we just took the other graph

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,010
and we shifted it to the left.

74
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,030
And we didn't do it with all the points.

75
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:16,990
We could have done it with more points,

76
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,140
but we did it with the two points

77
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,040
that we know definitely are defined for f of x, right?

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,030
And those two points definitely were shifted to the left.

79
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,010
This is actually a little bit complicated.

80
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,910
And a very simple way of thinking about this problem is,

81
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:38,010
in general, if I have f of x, then f of x plus anything--

82
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,420
f of x plus 2 in this case--

83
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,660
is going to be the same graph of f of x,

84
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,040
except I'm shifting it to the left.

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,990
And it's a little unintuitive that I'm adding 2,

86
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,380
but I'm shifting to the left.

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:58,040
And the intuition behind that is, whatever value f of 0 was,

88
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,020
now that's going to happen when I put a negative 2 in.

89
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,090
So that's the intuition why you're shifting to the left.

90
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,080
The old 0 is now the new negative 2.

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,430
Similarly, f of x minus 2, if I wanted to draw that,

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,080
would look something like this.

93
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,000
It would go like this.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,490
And it would come down, and it would go like this.

95
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,060
So that would be shifting to the right by 2.

96
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,040
And shifting up and down is actually much easier.

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,790
If we have f of x and we want to shift it up, say by 2,

98
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,010
then we'd have f of x plus 2.

99
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,000
We just change the y intercept.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,990
Or if we wanted to shift it down,

101
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,060
we'd have f of x minus 2.

102
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,010
Hopefully I didn't confuse you with all this jargon.

103
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,860
And the easy way to think about it is really just

104
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
what I told you, you know, this rule.

105
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,570
But I don't want you to just have the rule.

106
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,390
I want you to, hopefully,

107
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,050
have a little bit of intuition on how the shifting works.

108
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,050
Let's move on to the next problem.

109
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,050
Oh, I didn't tell you which choice that was.

110
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,320
Well if you just shift it to the left two,

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,060
it looks like choice number C.

112
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,000
All right, we're at number 18.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,030
And they have this figure.

114
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:20,000
This is a triangle.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,030
It's like that.

116
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:28,040
And then within that, there's another triangle.

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,020
It looks like that.

118
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:43,030
And then we have A, B, C, D, E, F.

119
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,010
It says, in the figure above, AB is equal to BC.

120
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,060
So AB, so this big triangle.

121
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,030
Maybe I'll draw it in this color.

122
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,000
So this side, AB, is equal to BC.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,580
So both sides are equal.

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,010
Now what does that immediately tell us?

125
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,610
If we have 2 sides equal,

126
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,090
that means that the base angles are equal.

127
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,870
That means that this angle is going to

128
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,020
be equal to this angle.

129
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,090
What else do we know?

130
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,070
And DE is equal to EF is equal to DF.

131
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,770
So we also know-- I'll switch colors--

132
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,020
that DE is equal to EF is equal to DF.

133
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,150
And that immediately tells us

134
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,020
this is an equilateral triangle.

135
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,240
All the sides are the same,

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,030
so all the angles have to be the same.

137
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,320
So this angle has to be equal to this angle,

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,010
which has to be equal to this angle.

139
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,070
And they're all going to be 60 degrees.

140
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,040
They're all going to be equal to 60 degrees.

141
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,090
OK. Now what else are they telling us?

142
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:48,460
If the measure of angle ABC-- so this angle is 30 degrees,

143
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,740
that's what they're telling us--

144
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:02,050
and the measure of BDE is 50 degrees, so this is 50 degrees.

145
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,040
They want to know what DFA is.

146
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,050
So we want to figure out this angle right here.

147
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,010
So this is the angle game again.

148
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,660
So a couple of things. If this angle up here is 30,

149
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,020
what are these base angles going to be?

150
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,070
Well they're going to have to add up, all of them combined,

151
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,060
add up to 180, right?

152
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,000
So that means that these two are going to add up to 150--

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,590
because you know 180 minus 30-- and they're the same.

154
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,010
So they're the same and they add up to 150.

155
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,090
They're both going to have to be 75 degrees.

156
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,070
So that's 75 degrees, and that is 75 degrees, right?

157
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,060
And then what else do we know?

158
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,510
Well we know if this angle is 50, if this angle is 60,

159
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,050
what is this angle right here going to be?

160
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,240
Well these three angles are going to

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,060
have to add up to 180 as well, right?

162
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,030
So 180 minus 50 is 130 minus 60 is 70.

163
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,060
So this angle is 70 degrees.

164
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,720
And now if I were to draw this a little bit bigger,

165
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,270
it'd look something like this where

166
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,070
this is A, this is D, this is F.

167
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm just drawing this triangle right here.

168
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,590
And so this is 75, this is 70, and so what's this?

169
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:23,010
Well 180 minus 70 minus 75 is what?

170
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,060
That's 180 minus 180 minus 145.

171
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:34,030
And so that should be 35 degrees, and that is choice B.

172
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,010
I will see you in the next video.

173
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,250
And the important thing to realize,

174
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,040
this is just the angle game, which I've made videos on.

175
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,940
And you just have to keep saying oh,

176
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,360
the angles of the triangle add up to 180,

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,820
or there's supplementaries to that after 180,

178
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,730
or you just have to remember that if the sides are equal,

179
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,040
then the base angles are equal.

180
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
And then you can figure them out

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,020
because you know what the third angle is.

182
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,020
I'll see you in the next video.
