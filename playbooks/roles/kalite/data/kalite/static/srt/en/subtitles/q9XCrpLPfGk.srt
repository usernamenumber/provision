00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:08,600
The perimeter of a rectangular fence measures 0.72 kilometers. The length of the fenced area is

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:17,867
160 meters. What is its width? Now the first thing that jumps out is that they're giving us different units.

3
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:23,067
They're giving us the perimeter in terms of kilometers and the length in terms of meters.

4
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:28,933
I am assuming that they want the width in meters because that's what they're giving us the length in.

5
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:41,667
Convert the perimeter into meters. So we have the perimeter P is equal to 0.72 kilometers which I'll write km for short. Kilometers.

6
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:45,800
1000 meters. That's what the prefix "kilo" means.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,267
And so we can say that for every 1 kilometer we have a 1000 meters.

8
00:00:54,652 --> 00:01:00,733
And you might say so how do you know to multiply it by a 1000 instead of divide by a 1000?

9
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,333
One way to think about it and this is probably the best way to think about it is

10
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:11,200
a kilometer is a huge bunch of meters, its actually 1000 meters. So if I am converting kilometers into meters

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,467
I should have a much larger number whatever my number is in kilometers it should be a much larger number in meters.

12
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:27,733
And also if you care about Dimensional Analysis, the dimensions cancel out here too. We have km in the numerator, km in the denominator.

13
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:34,667
So you multiply it, you have 0.72 times a 1000 m and to multiply anything times a 1000 or

14
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:42,000
any power of 10 if I multiply it by 10 I'll move the decimal to the right one space

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,133
that would be multiplying it by 10 , it would be 7.2,

16
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,000
multiplying it by a 100 would give us 72.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,319
If we are multiplying by a 1000 that would give us 720.

18
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:04,845
So this is going to be equal to 720 m. So that is the perimeter.

19
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:16,789
Now let's remind ourselves what the perimeter even is then hopefully we can figure out the width.

20
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:22,269
And they tell us that the length is 160 m. So let's say that that's this dimension over here.

21
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:30,867
The length (l) is 160 m. Its a rectangle so these sides are both the same length.

22
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:36,467
And our width is what we need to solve for so that's our width (w) and this is also our width.

23
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:41,667
And the perimeter is the measure going around it. So the perimeter is going to be

24
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:47,267
this length plus this width plus that same length again plus that width over there.

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:03:03,800
Or the perimeter (P) is equal to the length (l) plus the width (w) plus the length (l) plus the width (w)

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,400
We know what the length is so then the perimeter would be equal to

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:23,662
160 m plus w plus 160 m plus w. And then we know what the perimeter is. That's actually 720 m.

28
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:37,130
So 720 m is equal to 160 m plus w plus 160 m plus w. Now there's a bunch of different ways to solve for w.

29
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:44,421
One way is to just add the width plus the length once, that's going to add up to half of the perimeter.

30
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:51,155
So if I just go half way around the rectangle that's going to add up to half the perimeter.

31
00:03:51,155 --> 00:04:08,067
So w plus 160 m should be equal to one half of the perimeter which is one half times 720 m.

32
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:30,025
Or w plus 160 m is equal to 720 divided by 2 which is 360 m. And so now you have w plus 160 m is 360 m.

33
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:42,800
So we could now subtract 160 from both sides to solve for it. Something plus 160 is 360,

34
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,576
you could in your head say, well, that something must be 200. 200 plus 160 is 360.

35
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:57,703
The width (w) is 200 m. Or if you want to do it a little bit more formally you subtract 160 m

36
00:04:57,703 --> 00:05:09,081
from both sides of this equation and you are left with the width (w) is equal to 200 m.

37
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:13,353
We've solved the problem. The other way is you could actually go straight from this equation.

38
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:30,667
So we get 720 is 160 plus 160 (320) and width (w) plus width (w) or 2 times the width (2w).

39
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:37,781
Anything plus itself is just 2 times that anything. Now if this plus 320 is equal to 720,

40
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:46,001
what plus 320 is 720? Well this thing must be equal to 400. Or, formally,

41
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:57,936
subtract 320 from both sides of this. And you would get 400 is equal to 2w.

42
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:04,344
So if 2 times something is equal to 400 that something must be 200.

43
00:06:04,344 --> 99:59:59,999
Or you can divide both sides of this equation by 2. Either way you will get the width is equal to 200 m.
