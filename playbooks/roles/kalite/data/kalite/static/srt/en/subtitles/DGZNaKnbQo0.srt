1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this chart right here were given out scores on midterm and final exams

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were the vertical axis is the scoring points

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and each of this pairs of bar charts give us for an individual

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the blue bars for example how he show
dead on the midterm

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the yellow is how you on the final for emily the blues how they she did on the
midterm yellows how she did on the final

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have a bunch of interesting questions here

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the first question what was the median. What was the median score for the final exam?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is a review medium literally means what was the middle score.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
really we should list all the scores for the final exam and sort them in order and and figure out what the middle score actually was

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
soul so they're all the scores on final exam, so scores

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
scores on the final exam so you have a hundred here is shawn got a hundred on the final exam remember this yellow bars the final exam

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so there's a hundred emily also got a hundred on the final exam looks like it wasn't easy final exam

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
daniels about a hundred on the final exam

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then what's the jessica alot section got a seven five

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
seventy-five and william got an eighty

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so for a sword these in order to assume it is an increasing order you could be could rival the loan score was a seventy five

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then you have any eighty and then you have three hundreds, one hundred another hundred and another hundred

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so there's five scores right over here so you will have a middle look at any given number than you would take the mean of the two center of the two center values

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but here you have one center value when you when you order like this it's pretty clear that your center value your middle value is one hundred

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the median score for the final exam is one hundred and that's because you had so many hundreds here that the media in the middle score was still a hundred

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what is the main arrange the mid range of the midterm scorers

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
alluded blue one honor of the color of the bars for the midterm

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the main range is the media your highest and lowest scores

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was collected this was going to the mid range

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the mid range if you can view it as the arithmetic mean or the average of your highest and lowest scores so the mid range of midterms

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of made

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's see the highest midterm score looking at the blue the highest one is right here

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so i've just got a hundred on the midterm so that's your high school work

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your lowest score on the midterm looks like this one out of your daniel got a sixty

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
got a sixty and so the mid range is going to be the mean the arithmetic mean of these two numbers so you add a hundred plus sixty divide by two you get one sixty over to or eighty

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this right over here it is going to be

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what was the average student score for the final exam

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pool for that we just have to add up the scores on the final exams and divide by the number of scores we have

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we might be able to that in our heads footsie close wicked magistrate of first years we have one hundred

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus one hundred plus one hundred plus seventy five plus eighty

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so all of that divided by

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all of that divided by five they'll give us our average someone told you have written about getting more information the probly talking about the arithmetic mean

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is going to be three hundred plus, let's see three hundred plus, uh... another hundred fifty-five system before fifty-five over five this issue coating for fifty five over five

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and c_-five this is going to be equal to
five goes in let me write down here this is equal to five goes into forty-five or four hundred fifteen ninety times and two five once this is going to be equal to ninety one

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the average score for the final exam is aiding ninety one

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what was the motive for the final exam scores

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the mode is the most common score so once again we've listed all of them it's pretty clear that the most common score years a hundred a hundred shows up three times all seventy five alicia someone's an a<u>t</u>t_ only shows at once

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you're the most common score is a hundred chills three-time

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what does the range of the midterm scores

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the rangers literally the difference between the highest score and to the lowest score

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the high score we are a figured out and this is for the midterm the midterm so the highest score is a hundred

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're gonna subtract from that the low score which was a sixty

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the range is equal to forty the mid range was the average of these two things the range is just the difference between the two

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the range of the midterm scores is forty and were done.
