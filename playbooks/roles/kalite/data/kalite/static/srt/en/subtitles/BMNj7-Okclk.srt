1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:04,796
What I've done here is list a bunch of events that might occur in a given period

2
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:08,316
And what I'm going to think about in this video is how if at all

3
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:13,928
they might be accounted for in GDP, especially in this expenditure view of GDP

4
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,567
I encourage you to pause this video and try it out yourself

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,513
to see how each of these events happen in a period for which we're trying

6
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:24,999
to calculate the GDP what how they will be accounted for

7
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:29,443
according to the buckets we've talked about, the compositions of the expenditure view of GDP

8
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:32,313
so now I'm assuming that you've unfold try

9
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:35,472
so let's try to go through it. Kahn academy is

10
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:39,040
Kahn Academy is A-frm it's not for profit firm, none really owns Kahn Academy, it goes to society

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,009
society owns Kahn Academy, but it is a firm. So Kahn Academy employs

12
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,503
a software engeneers and pays them a 100,000 USD

13
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:51,335
well this is A-firm making the expenditure and arguably

14
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:54,639
in even conceptually this also is an investment because it's

15
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:58,168
100,000 USD is going to be used to develop called as future benefit

16
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:02,982
so this is going to be the investment category

17
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:05,221
mark it with the same colours so I - i

18
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:10,766
"I" - investment is going to get plus 100,000 USD

19
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:16,927
in general the spending by firm goes into investment, now look at the second scenery

20
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:20,037
Accenture which is another firm this is A-for profit firm

21
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:25,090
earns 10 M USD we'll just say it's 10 M USD in revenue

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,789
10 M in revenue just to be clear what are we talking about

23
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:34,063
gets 10 M in revenue by building a new

24
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:37,462
IT system for California. An importand thing about

25
00:01:37,462 --> 00:01:42,555
this is OK Acceture is a firm, but California is clearly the government

26
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:45,534
is clearly the government, so how do you account for this?

27
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:49,839
the expenditure view of GDP so in this situation

28
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:53,806
California is spending 10 M USD

29
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:57,940
10 M USD in a period for a new IT system

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,637
so this is going to be government. The goverment cathegory

31
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:04,267
is going to increased by 10 M because of this expenditure

32
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:07,242
Now next one:

33
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:10,147
my mother sells our house in a New Orleans to a Swedish woman

34
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:13,410
for 200 thousand USD once againg: our house is being sold

35
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,838
from someone in the country to someone who is foreign what we do

36
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:23,050
but an important thing to realise is that this is not a new house, this is a transfer of

37
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,055
of an existing house, nothing was produced here, so

38
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:29,971
this has no contribution. this has no contribution to GDP

39
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:35,009
doesn't matter that this is a Swedish woman or anything like that the house has existed before and just changed hands

40
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,782
a new house do not get produced so nothing happpens to GDP

41
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:42,430
here. next one: I and

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,932
I'm assuming that i'm here sitting here California American citizen I buy a Japanese

43
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:51,203
made lawnmover for 200 USD. Now that one is interesting

44
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:55,420
this one is interesting because if you think about theoretically nothing

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,168
was produced in US so nothing should be add

46
00:02:58,168 --> 00:03:01,346
to GDP on net-net basis and so we'll see that's actually the case

47
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:05,197
but it's going to show up by adding to consumption and taking away from

48
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:11,316
that exports, so two things are going to happen here we'll say OK Sal in an American consumer

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,313
if we just looked how much more he spent he spent

50
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:18,755
200 USD more so it's going to be added there but we're going to take it out

51
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:21,497
of net exports so

52
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:24,138
net exports we'll do it at the same green colour

53
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:29,577
net exports - everything else is neutral so

54
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:35,934
in this thing right over here there is no foreign purchases but there is me buying a foreing product

55
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:39,204
at let me subtract it out so i'm going to subtract it out

56
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:43,764
200 USD right over there so net exports will be lower

57
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:46,738
by 200 USD and that

58
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:51,130
it was essentially this was a 200 USD's import and that completelly cancels out 200 USD increase in consumption

59
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,666
and so this will have zero net effect on GDP

60
00:03:54,666 --> 00:04:00,081
this two term will cancel out. now I buy a new home in California

61
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:02,088
for 500,000 USD

62
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:07,443
now household spending for the most part is considered C except

63
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:11,096
when you're buing a new home so even

64
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:15,337
though that I'm not a firm because I'm buying a house

65
00:04:15,337 --> 00:04:19,164
a new house this will go into investment so

66
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:24,405
investment will go up by 500,000 USD and than

67
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:27,886
finally American Airlines buys a new airbus-jet

68
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:31,980
airbus jet are made in Europe so what is going to happen here

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,501
so once again: net-net nothing was produced in the US

70
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,321
US so on a net base that shoud not contribute to GDP

71
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:44,326
and we''ll see that on net basis it will break out will be neutral but it will be like

72
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,314
this situation: there is an American firm that make A-purchase

73
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:52,171
actually I'm going to put it out here so let's say there is a 100 M USD

74
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,098
I think i buy

75
00:04:55,098 --> 00:05:00,269
for 100 M USD so the way it is accounted for investment

76
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:03,913
would go up by 100 M USD you have an American

77
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:07,931
firm making a purchase 100 M USD is going to

78
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,774
also provide future goods and services

79
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:15,755
your transportation to people it's going to be netted out because

80
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:20,739
you have in net import so this

81
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:24,270
it's going to do a net export on this side of it

82
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,850
100 M USD because it was an import negative

83
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,616
taken from an export point of view and you have no corresponding

84
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:36,236
posivitve export so you're going to have net exports

85
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:40,098
net exports is going to go down 100 M USD

86
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:45,048
this was A- net import of a hundred M so it makes sense that net exports will go down

87
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:48,067
will be negative net export and these two once againg

88
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:52,143
are going to cancel out with other so you have no net GDP

89
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,355
which makes sense because this plane was not produced in the US.
