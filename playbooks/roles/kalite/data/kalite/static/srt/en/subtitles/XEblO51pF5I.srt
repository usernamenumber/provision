1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome to the second
presentation on functions.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,370
So let's take off where
we left off before.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,510
I still apologize -- in
retrospect that that

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,770
whole Sal food example.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,460
Well maybe it was helpful, so
I'm going to leave it there.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,050
Let's do some more problems.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,050
I think the best thing is to
keep doing problems with you

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,050
and I think you'll see the
example, and hopefully

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,960
you'll actually see that
functions are kind of fun.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,230
Let's do some more problems.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,840
Let's start off with an
example, not too different

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,630
than what we saw before.

13
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:47,210
Let's say that g of x is
equal to 1 if x is even, and

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:56,030
it equals 0 if x is odd.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:15,595
And let's say f of x is equal
to x plus 3 times g of x.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,860
And let's say -- I'm going to
make it really complicated --

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,130
well, actually I'm not going
to make it any more

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,990
complicated now.

19
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,680
So let's try some problems.

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,800
So let's give an example.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,080
What is f of 5.

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,180
Well, it's really pretty
straightforward.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,560
We take this 5 and we replace
it for x in the function f.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:49,890
So f of 5 is equal to 5 plus
3 times g of 5, right?

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,190
We just literally took this
5 and replace it everywhere

26
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,360
where we see an x.

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,070
If instead of a 5, I had like a
dog here, it would be f of dog

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,590
would equal dog plus
3 times g of dog.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,700
Not that that would necessarily
make any sense, but

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,970
you get the idea.

31
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,530
So f of 5 equals 5
plus 3 times g of 5.

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,290
But what does that equal?

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,000
So the 5 stays the same, plus 3
times -- well what's g of 5?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,750
Well, if we put 5 here,
if 5 is even we do 1,

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,730
if five is odd we do 0.

36
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,480
Well 5 is odd so it's a 0.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,270
So g of 5 is equal to 0.

38
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,700
So this is 3 times 0.

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,550
So this equals just 5,
right, because 3 times

40
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,400
0 is equal to 5.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,050
Well what would be f of 6?

42
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:42,090
Well, f of 6 would equal
6 plus 3 times g of 6.

43
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,540
And once again, that equals 6
plus -- well, this time g of

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,560
6 is, well, 6 is even, so 1.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,370
So g of 6 is equal to 1.

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,300
So this equals 6
plus 3 times 1.

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,080
So this equals 6 plus
3 which equals 9.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,820
I think you might be
getting the idea now.

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,140
At first when you see a problem
with a lot of these functions,

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,770
it seems very confusing.

51
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,910
But if you just keep taking
what's inside of the

52
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,960
parentheses and replacing that
for x and just keep moving

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,690
along that way, you make a lot
of progress on these problems.

54
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,260
Let's try a harder one.

55
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:27,370
Let's say I said that f of x
is equal to x squared plus 1.

56
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:45,440
Let's say that g of x is equal
to 2x plus f of x minus 3.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:53,325
And h of x is equal to 5x.

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,440
Now I'm going to give
you a tough problem.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,620
What is h of g of x?

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,500
No.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,660
What is h of g of -- let's
pick a number -- let's say 3?

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,130
h of g of 3.

63
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,310
Actually, we'll do examples in
the future where we actually

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,520
could leave the x there
and we'll solve for it.

65
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,810
But let's say this particular
example, what is h of g of 3?

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,050
At first you might say wow,
this is crazy, Sal, I don't

67
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,650
know how to even start here.

68
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,200
But you just take
it step-by-step.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,170
What can we figure out?

70
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,350
Can we figure out
what g of 3 is?

71
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,540
Well sure.

72
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,220
We could take the 3 and put
it into the function g and

73
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,000
see what it spits out.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,460
So let's work on g of 3 first.

75
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:46,400
So, g of 3 equals -- well it's
2 times 3, right, we're just

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,450
replacing wherever we
see an x with a 3.

77
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:56,970
So it's 2 times 3, so that's
6, plus f of -- what, we'll

78
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,640
just replace the x again.

79
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,140
3 minus 3, right?

80
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,560
So this g of 3 is equal
to 6 plus f of what?

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,500
3 minus 3 is 0.

82
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,200
Now we have to figure
out f of 0 is.

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,030
We have a definition here for
f, so we just figure it out.

84
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:24,040
f of 0 is equal to -- well,
you replace the 0 here.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,810
So you get 0 squared,
which is 0 plus 1.

86
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,130
So it's f of 0 is 1.

87
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,910
So you take that and you
replace it for f of 0.

88
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,360
So you get g of 3 is
equal to 6 plus 1.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,820
So g of 3 is equal to 7, right?

90
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,490
Now we know what g
of 3 is equal to.

91
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,470
We can substitute
that back here.

92
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,430
So that's the same thing -- we
know g of 3 is equal to 7,

93
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,920
so that's the same
thing as h of 7.

94
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,360
And h of 7 is just equal
to 5 times 7 equals 35.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,060
So I think you're probably a
little confused here, and I

96
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,270
would have been if I
was in your shoes.

97
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,610
But the important thing is when
you first see this problem

98
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,730
you're like what can
I tackle first?

99
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,640
h of g of 3, it seems
very confusing.

100
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,390
Well, g of 3, can
I tackle that?

101
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,610
Sure.

102
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,295
I have a definition of what
the function g does when

103
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:24,280
it's given an x, or in
this case, was given a 3.

104
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,190
And that's what we did.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,990
We figured out what
g of 3 was first.

106
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,410
And g of 3, we just substituted
the 3, and we said well that's

107
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,850
6 plus f of 3 minus 3, right?

108
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,240
Because we just replaced
that x with that 3.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,630
And we just kept solving.

110
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,070
We figured out what
f of 0 is up here.

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,050
And we got g of 3 equals 7.

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,290
Then we substituted that
back in right here.

113
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,200
We got h of 7 is equal to 35
because it was 5 times 7.

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,700
Let's do some more problems.

115
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,670
Actually, let's do another
example with the same

116
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,880
set of functions.

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,980
I don't want to keep confusing
you with new functions.

118
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,260
Let me it erase this
as fast as I can.

119
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,925
I think I'm getting faster
at this erasing business.

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,210
You can sit and think a little
bit about what we just

121
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,110
did while I erase.

122
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,530
So let's do another problem.

123
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:56,530
What is f of h of 10?

124
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,080
Well, first we want to figure
out what h of 10 is, right?

125
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,510
Well, we could do it
in a different way

126
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,170
as we'll see later.

127
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,100
But we can figure out what
h of 10 is pretty easily.

128
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,460
We take the 10,
substitute it in for x.

129
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,830
h of 10 is equal to 5 times x.

130
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,910
In this case x is 10
so it equals 50.

131
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,910
So we know h of 10 equals 50.

132
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,010
So we know h of 10 equals
50, so we substitute

133
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,820
that back in here.

134
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,080
So we say f of h of 10 is
the same thing as f of 50.

135
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,890
And then f of 50 is, I think
pretty straightforward

136
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,660
at this point.

137
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,110
You just take that 50 and
replace it back here.

138
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,150
Well, it's 50 squared plus 1.

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,690
Well, 50 squared
is 2,500 plus 1.

140
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,410
That equals 2,501.

141
00:08:49,410 --> 00:09:01,930
What is g of h of 1?

142
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,920
Well, we take h of 1, h of 1 is
5, so this is equal to g of 5.

143
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,840
And g of 5, we just replace the
5 here, so g of 5 is equal to 2

144
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,810
times 5 plus f of 5 minus 3.

145
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,230
We just take wherever we saw
an x and replace it with a 5.

146
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:25,520
Well, that's equal to 2 times
5 is 10, plus f of 5 minus 3.

147
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,730
Well 5 minus 3 is 2.

148
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,950
Plus f of 2.

149
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,470
What's f of 2?

150
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,902
Well, 2 squared plus 1 is
5, right? f of 2 is 5

151
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,630
-- 2 squared plus 1.

152
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,400
So that equals 10 plus
5 which equals 15.

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,340
If you're still
confused, don't worry.

154
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,990
I'm about to record some more
problems that will give you

155
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,780
even more examples of
function problems.

156
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,680
See you in the next
presentation.

157
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,980
Bye.
