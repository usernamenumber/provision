1
00:00:00,572 --> 00:00:04,446
y is directly proportional to x.

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:09,798
If y = 30 when x = 6, find the value of x when y = 45.

3
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:12,526
So let's just take this each statement at a time.

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:14,979
"y is directly proportional to x":

5
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:20,369
that's literally just saying that y is equal to some constant times x

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,185
This statement can literally be translated to y= some constant [writes k] * x.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,322
y is directly proportional to x.

8
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:32,664
Now they tell us if y = 30 when x = 6

9
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:36,708
so y is 30 when x is 6 [writes 30 = <space> 6]

10
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,975
And we have this constant of proportionality

11
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:40,956
This second statement right over here [adds k in space]

12
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,577
allows us to solve for this constant -

13
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:45,169
when x is 6 it tells us y is 30

14
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:47,054
so we can figure out what this constant is.

15
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:51,238
And we can divide both sides by 6 - divide both sides by 6 -

16
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,479
and we get, we get - this left hand side is 5, 30/6 = 5 -

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,774
5 = k or k=5

18
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:04,071
so the second sentence tells us - this gives us the information

19
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:10,228
that y is not just k<i>x, it tells us that y = 5</i>x.

20
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:12,559
y is 30 when x is 6.

21
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:17,867
And then finally, they say find the value of x when y= 45.

22
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:24,918
So when y is 45, we have 45 is equal to - so this, we're just putting 45 in for y -

23
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,280
45 = 5x

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,164
Divide both sides by 5, to solve for x

25
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:36,510
We get 45/5 is 9. And 5x/5 is just x.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,280
So x is, x = 9 when y=45.
