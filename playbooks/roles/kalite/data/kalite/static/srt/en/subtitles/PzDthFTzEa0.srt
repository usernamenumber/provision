1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:11,862
We've spoken a lot about monopolies and we've spoken a lot about perfect competition.

2
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:19,093
And we kind of view them as polar opposites. Over here you have exactly one player, here you have many players.

3
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:24,147
In a monopoly you get to set the price of the quantity, here you have to be a price taker.

4
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:29,105
In a monopoly, there's huge barriers to entry, in perfect competition there's no barriers to entry.

5
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:35,440
What I want to think about in this video is are there other situations, or especially are there terms for other situations, that are in between?

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,153
To think about that, I'm going to draw a spectrum. I'm going to do a two dimensional spectrum.

7
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:44,382
I could probably think of more variables where there's nuance between these terms, but these are the two big ones.

8
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:48,361
So in one dimension, I'm going to think about the number of competitors that there are.

9
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:54,869
This is a number of competitors.

10
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,171
Competitors. Number of competitors.

11
00:00:56,171 --> 00:01:03,309
Now, obviously a monopoly is one competitor; perfect competition you've got a bunch of competitors.

12
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,627
So I'll put one right over here and a bunch of competitors.

13
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:11,610
If this were zero there wouldn't even be a market to speak of; no one is participating there.

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,404
In this axis, in the vertical axis, I want to think about how differentiated

15
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:24,225
the competitors in the market are. How different are their products or their brands?

16
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:28,701
Differentiation in the market.

17
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:33,524
And this was low differentiation and this is high differentiation.

18
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:36,841
So let's think of a bunch of industries and think about where they sit here

19
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:43,053
and then I'll introduce you to two new words other than just a monopoly or perfect competition.

20
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:49,034
So, let's just say that we live in a world where there's fifty producers of screws

21
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,848
and all those screws are completely identical.

22
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:56,103
And so, if one producer charges even a penny more no one's going to want to go to them

23
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:59,747
because they can get the exact same thing from one of the many other producers.

24
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:05,966
That would be a case right over here - low differentiation, all the screws are the same and there are a bunch of competitors.

25
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:09,286
So, that's about as perfect as a perfect competition can get in the real world.

26
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:18,677
So, bunch of identical screw manufacturers.

27
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:21,105
I'm not sure if the actual screw market has a bunch of competitors,

28
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:24,643
but let's just assume if it did you would be sitting right over here,

29
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:28,632
pretty close in the world of perfect competition.

30
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,214
In the other spectrum you imagine you are a utilities,

31
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:35,460
and most places in the U.S. and probably the world, there is only one utility,

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,666
one entity that's managing the power lines.

33
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,260
A lot of times it's actually run by the government,

34
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,732
but in most of the U.S. it's a regulated private company.

35
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,482
And so here you have one player, and you could debate whether

36
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:53,362
it's low differentiation or so high differentiation that it's the only player.

37
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,694
But, let's just stick it right over there, low differentiation.

38
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:00,014
This right over here might be a utility.

39
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:06,578
That's about as close to a monopoly, or that actually is a monopoly - they are the only player there.

40
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:12,811
Mono, mono comes from one. Poly comes from seller. One seller that would be a utility.

41
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:16,351
Now there are things that would be in-between.

42
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:21,584
So, for example, if you thought about your, say the telephone providers in your area.

43
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:26,393
There are more than a few people who can provide phone service, especially with the age of internet telephony,

44
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:29,896
now the cable companies are starting to provide phone service and the telephone companies

45
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:32,952
are starting to provide internet and cable service.

46
00:03:32,952 --> 00:03:34,548
So, we could think of that market.

47
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,166
Let's put this market right over here.

48
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:42,020
So, the number of competitors is low, so it's going to be here, and they are somewhat differentiated,

49
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,499
they might give you a different cable box, or they might offer you slightly

50
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:47,381
different levels of bandwidth or whatever else.

51
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,551
So, they're somewhat differentiated right over here.

52
00:03:49,551 --> 00:04:03,397
So, I'll call that the cable internet telephone providers right over there.

53
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:12,550
Then you can think of markets where there's a bunch of competitors, but they are somewhat differentiated.

54
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,200
I can think of fine dining.

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,341
So, here there's a bunch of restaurants in any place that sells, you know, nice food

56
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:23,666
and they really define themselves by the quality of the food that they produce.

57
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:29,644
So, they're highly differentiated. Each restaurant is unique, the chef's have specialties and all the rest.

58
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,641
But, there's a bunch of them.

59
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:38,913
So, right over here I will put fine dining.

60
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:42,336
You could also imagine, you know, name brand clothing.

61
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:48,798
They're very differentiated, certain designers, certain materials and all those type of things, but there's a bunch of them.

62
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:56,604
Name brand clothing. It's not quite perfect competition;

63
00:04:56,604 --> 00:05:01,918
it's very competitive, there's a bunch of players there, but they're not selling the same product.

64
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,068
They are very, very differentiated.

65
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:07,237
To some degree, you almost feel like even though there's all this competition,

66
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:10,402
they have a monopoly on their own product.

67
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:15,539
Another one could be, you could imagine something like, high-end laptops, or high-end computers,

68
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:21,361
or nice computers. Maybe I'll just say computers in general.

69
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:31,636
Some people might want to go for an Apple, that's what they have associated with, and some people might want to go for a Sony.

70
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:42,687
So, maybe I'll put branded computers up here. But, then you could also have something like the

71
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:48,814
unbranded PC market, and that might be something closer to here where you might have these random manufacturers,

72
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,244
you don't even care, some manufacturer from overseas, you don't even care

73
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:54,276
but they are saying that they're using the same processor, the same memory chip,

74
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:57,478
they're using all the same things. So, they're much less differentiated.

75
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:05,098
So, this might be over here, unbranded, and that tends to happen with the personal computer industry.

76
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,418
It's usually like, well, they're using the same chip, the same memory, they're all running Windows,

77
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:15,445
whatever else. There's not a lot of difference between them, so those actually start getting closer to perfect competition.

78
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:23,000
So, the whole reason that I've introduced these ideas to you is that there are names for these things

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,997
that aren't quite perfect competition, because they're highly differentiated,

80
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:31,168
and there are names for these things that aren't quite monopolies because they have a few providers.

81
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:37,304
These right over here, so, we can put other things around here, so I'll circle this general area.

82
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:47,500
We would call these oligopolies. Oli, this comes from this part right over here,

83
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,835
and I'm not an expert in Greek, but this comes from few.

84
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:53,481
And, obviously, the poly, once again, just as with monopolies, comes from sellers.

85
00:06:53,481 --> 00:07:00,859
So, this means few sellers. In oligopolies, and we're going to study this in much more detail,

86
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:03,933
they're not quite monopolies, they can't set the price and the quantity, and they can,

87
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:09,324
depending on the oligopoly, depending on the market, they might start acting more like a monopoly.

88
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:13,350
The players could coordinate with each other, to their mutual benefit,

89
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,782
or they might become fiercely competitve. Even if there's only a few providers.

90
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:21,536
So, oligopolies can kind of, in their personality characteristics,

91
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:27,016
can either look more like monopolies, or they can look like very competitive industries.

92
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:30,907
And these things up here, where these are quite competitive industries,

93
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:35,707
they are highly differentiated. To some degree you could say that,

94
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:40,402
for example, in branded computers Apple has a monopoly on selling Apple computers.

95
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:44,947
It doesn't have a monopoly on computers. Obviously there are many, many people that can

96
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:49,497
provide computers, but they have a brand; if someone wants an Apple computer,

97
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:55,088
you have to go to Apple. It's a self-evident statement. But, they're highly differentiated,

98
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:59,502
highly branded, so they have a monopoly on their product,

99
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:05,285
but there are many, many other competitors who are out there who won't let them just set price

100
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,779
because they sell products that serve the same purpose,

101
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,653
but they're differentiated in some way.

102
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:14,810
So, these players up over here, we would call these, or these markets,

103
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:23,886
these are monopolistic competition.

104
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:28,673
And when you first hear that it sounds more because the first word you hear in monopolistic.

105
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:33,167
But, this is more, at least in my mind, closer to perfect competition

106
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:36,512
than it is to a monopoly. This is, at least the way I view it in my mind,

107
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,156
monopoly is completely, completely uncompetitive.

108
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:45,383
While this is still highly competitive; it's still not quite as highly competitive as perfect competition,

109
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:48,517
but it's close. You have a monopoly in just your product,

110
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:59,145
but there are are not too similar products on the market who's prices affect your price.

111
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:03,607
There are other alternatives, I should say, in the market that will affect people's demand

112
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:08,676
for your product. And the best give away between a monopolistic competitor

113
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:14,788
and perfect competition is that there is some differentiation between the products

114
00:09:14,788 --> 99:59:59,999
over here, there is some branding here, maybe some quality difference between the products.
