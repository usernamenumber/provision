00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Problem number six

2
00:00:01,987 --> 00:00:05,800
Let f of x is equal to the sine of x-squared plus cosine of x

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:12,067
The graph of y is equal to the absolute value of the fifth derivative of f at x is shown above

4
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:15,533
and I haven't shown it here just so we have some space. I'll show it when we need to show it

5
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,333
I think we have to show it in part D.

6
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,323
So first let's do part A right over here.

7
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:24,427
Write the first four nonzero terms of the Taylor series for sin of x

8
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:30,533
about x=0, and write the first four nonzero terms of the Taylor series for the sin of x-squared

9
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,533
about x equals zero. So let's do this first part.

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,270
And just as a reminder, a Taylor series is a polynomial approximation

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,937
of a function. So just to give us a quick reminder--we go into much more detail

12
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:44,533
in this on the videos about Taylor series.

13
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:49,200
But if you have a function that looks like this, and you wanted to approximate it with a Taylor series

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,800
around zero, you could, if you only have one term in your Taylor series, you would just literally

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,200
it would just be a constant, just like that. If you have two terms in your Taylor series

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,867
it would be a line that looks like that.

17
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:05,271
If you have three terms in your Taylor series, you'd get to a second-degree term.

18
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,000
You'd start approximating it something like that.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you get to the third degree term, it might start looking like that

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,092
And as you add more and more terms, you get a better and better approximation of your function

21
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:19,273
and if you add an infinite number, it might actually converge to your function.

22
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:23,533
So let's just remind ourselves. If I had a function, if I have f of x

23
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,667
its Taylor series: I can approximate it with a Taylor series.

24
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,667
And if we want to center that approximation around zero,

25
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:37,106
it'll be equal to f of zero plus f-prime of zero (the derivative at zero) times x

26
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:42,867
plus the second derivative at zero times x-squared over 2 factorial.

27
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:46,400
(You could have divided this term right here by 1 factorial, which is just 1)

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
2 factorial is just 2.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,733
And then plus the third derivative of f at zero times x to the third over 3 factorial

30
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,800
plus the fourth derivative . . . I think you get the idea here.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,867
the fourth derivative at zero times x to the fourth divided by four factorial

32
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,084
and so on and so forth.

33
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,400
So what they want us to do is to find the first four non-zero terms of the

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Taylor series for sine of x

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,467
And some of you might already know this. We actually covered this

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:19,800
in the video where we show Euler's identity, but we'll do it again right over here.

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,867
So if we just take, I'll call it g(x), because they already

38
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,133
defined f(x) up here. So let's say that g(x)

39
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,837
And let's put this in a new color, just to ease the monotony

40
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:38,800
Let's say that g of x is equal to sin of x. Then we know that g of zero

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,133
is going to be equal to zero.

42
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,667
And then if we take the derivative, g-prime of x is going

43
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,763
to be equal to negative, no it's going to be positive cosine of x

44
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:54,733
Positive cosine of x. g-prime of zero is now going to be equal to 1

45
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:58,097
cosine of zero is one. Then if you take the second derivative.

46
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:02,091
The derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x

47
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:06,733
And the second derivative at zero, once again, is going

48
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,000
to be equal to zero. Sine of zero is zero.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,082
And now let's take the third derivative

50
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:16,071
The third derivative of our function, g, the derivative of

51
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,209
negative sine of x is negative cosine of x.

52
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,600
And the third derivative at zero is now going to be

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,000
equal to negative one. And we could keep going.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,800
You can already guess where this might lead to.

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,133
But I'll just keep going, just in case.

56
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:37,400
The fourth derivative is once again going to be equal to sine of x

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,684
is now going to be equal to sine of x. And then the

58
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:45,067
fourth derivative at zero, because it's the same thing as the function

59
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,347
is now going to be zero as well.

60
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:51,933
So this is going to be equal to g the fourth at zero.

61
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,133
And then we could keep going. This is going to be the same thing

62
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,533
as g to the fifth because we start cycling

63
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,800
as we take more and more derivatives. So this is going to be

64
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,867
the same thing as the fifth derivative at zero

65
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:07,933
This is going to be the same thing as the sixth derivative at zero

66
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:13,423
And this is going to be the same--this is an equals sign right here

67
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:15,400
equals one. And this is going to be the same thing as the seventh

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,200
derivative at zero. So if you want the first four

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,800
non-zero terms. Let's just work through it.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,200
So first of all, f of zero--I'll do this in a new color

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,351
if we want to approximate g of x

72
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,733
if we want to approximate sine of x

73
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,933
so we'll say sine of x is going to be approximately equal to

74
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,867
so this first term right over here

75
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,268
that is sine of 0, that's g of zero

76
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:41,101
that's going to be zero, so we don't even have to write it

77
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:43,867
then we go to this term right over here. Well the first derivative

78
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:47,400
f prime at zero, or in this case g prime of zero

79
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
is going to be equal to one

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,177
So it's going to be one times x. So you're going to have an x there

81
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:57,680
And the next term is going to be zero, we see that over there

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,200
because the second derivative of our function evaluated at zero is zero

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,014
our third derivative of our function evaluated at zero is 1

84
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:09,533
so that term's going to show up again

85
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,800
Actually, that term is negative one--I don't want to make a mistake here

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,604
that is negative one. It was negative cosine of x

87
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:19,867
if you evaluate negative cosine of x at zero you get negative one

88
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,086
right over here.

89
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:24,400
So the third derivative, this thing right over here, is negative one

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,352
So then we have minus x to the third over 3 factorial

91
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:31,929
The fourth derivative, once again, is zero

92
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:36,016
The fifth derivative evaluated at zero is one. So then

93
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:41,267
you're going to have plus 1 times x to the fifth over five factorial

94
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,400
Then the sixth derivative is zero, so that term is going to disappear

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,867
I didn't even write it up here.

96
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,933
And then the seventh term, the coefficient is negative one

97
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,933
Or, the seventh derivative evaluated at zero is negative one

98
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:57,200
So you have negative one times x to the seventh over seven factorial

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,350
And we had to go all the way to the seventh degree term to find

100
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,800
the first four non-zero terms for our Taylor series

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,467
And so, we're done with at least the first part.

102
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,937
We found the first four non-zero terms of sine of x.

103
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,267
So now what about sine squared of x

104
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,800
Or sine of x-squared. We have to be careful here. Because

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,133
you might just say, okay, let me just apply this formula

106
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,600
And you're going to find very quickly

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,733
when you start taking the second and third derivatives

108
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,682
of this thing right over here, it's going to get really messy

109
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:30,769
but what you can say is look, sine of x is approximately this thing over here

110
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,867
What happens if I just replace the x with x-squared?

111
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:39,533
Then I get sine of x-squared is approximately equal to

112
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,467
instead of an x here, I'm going to put the x-squared

113
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:48,509
instead of an x to the third, I'm going to put x-squared to the third over here, over three factorial

114
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,200
Instead of an x to the fifth, I can put an x-squared to the fifth power

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,933
over five factorial

116
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:58,516
and instead of an x to the seventh, I can put an x-squared to the seventh

117
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,867
power over seven factorial

118
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,184
So this is a very important thing to realize.

119
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:08,083
Because, if you had started to directly take the Taylor series around zero

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,335
of this thing right here, you'd have taken up all your time

121
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,425
to take the derivatives, and you probably wouldn't have been able

122
00:07:12,425 --> 00:07:14,467
to do it anyways, because it would have gotten really messy.

123
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,933
And the key here is just to realize that if you just substitute

124
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:22,200
x-squared for x, you're then going to get your approximation for

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,942
sine of x-squared.

126
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,000
And we can simplify this a little bit

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
This is going to be approximately equal to

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,605
x-squared minus x to the sixth over three factorial

129
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:34,600
plus x to the tenth over five factorial

130
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,685
minus x to the fourteenth over seven factorial

131
00:07:39,715 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's our second part of the problem.
