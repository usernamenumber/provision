00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,635
Lets say you are an Ancient Philosopher who was building up mathematics who was building mathematics from the ground up

2
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:13,783
And you already have a reasonable of what a negative number could or should represent and you know how to add and subtract negative numbers

3
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:15,767
But now you are faced with a conundrum

4
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:18,501
What happens when you multiply negative numbers?

5
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:21,233
Either when you multiply a positive number times a negative number

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,900
Or when you multiply two negative numbers

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,167
So, for example

8
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:32,502
You aren't quite sure what should happen if you were to multiply (and im just picking two numbers where one is positive and one is negative)

9
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:37,081
What would happen if you were to multiply 5 times negative 3

10
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,773
You're not quite sure about this just yet

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,702
You're also not quite sure what would happen if you multiply two negative numbers.

12
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:48,669
So lets say negative two times negative 6

13
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,835
This is also unclear to you

14
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:56,569
What you do know, because you are a mathematician, is however you define this or whatever this should be

15
00:00:56,569 --> 00:01:02,410
It should hopefully be consistant with all of the other properties of mathematics that you already know

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,233
And preferably all of the other properties of multiplication

17
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,233
That would make you feel comfortable that you are getting this right.

18
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,233
and later we can think about other ways to get the intitution

19
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,608
of what these might be allowed you to actually make sense

20
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:18,034
but to make this make consistent with the rest of mathematics

21
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:21,300
that you know, you go into a little bit of a thought experiment

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,700
you say, well, what should five times

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,524
three plus negative three equal

24
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:32,681
well you already have a philosophy of adding negative numbers

25
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:35,551
or adding positive numbers to negative numbers, you know negative three is

26
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,298
the opposite of three, but you add three to negative three

27
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:42,423
you're going to get zero, so this is going to be equal to

28
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:45,520
five times zero

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,102
based on how you already thought about adding a negative number

30
00:01:52,102 --> 00:01:54,369
to a positive, and anything times zero is going to be

31
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,900
zero, so this expression right over here should be zero

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,283
but you see, I want to multiply positive and negative

33
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:04,697
numbers to be consistent with this distributive property so

34
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:07,367
I should should be able to distribute this five

35
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:12,943
and for math to be consistent, and math should be consistent, I should

36
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,548
get the exact same answer, so let's distribute this five so

37
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:18,103
we get five times three

38
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:23,417
is going to write out as five times three

39
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:27,020
let me write this multiplication sign, not this dot

40
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,434
five times three, so i distributed there

41
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:35,925
plus five times negative three

42
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:39,358
i'll do that in yellow, five times negative three

43
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:45,843
and this whole thing we just said should be equal to zero

44
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:50,700
it should be equal to zero, well five times three

45
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,843
those are two positive numbers, we should know what should should be, that is going to be fifteen

46
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:57,825
now we get this thing, fifteen plus

47
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:01,506
times whatever five times negative three is

48
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:09,433
needs to be equal to zero in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics

49
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:12,806
that we know, well what plus fifteen is going to

50
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:16,498
be equal to zero, well the opposite of fifteen in order for this

51
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:20,000
to be true, in order for this to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,588
this right over here needs to be equal to

53
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:27,690
negative fifteen until you say five times negative three

54
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,170
in order to be consistent with all other mathematics we know, needs to

55
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,433
be equal to negative fifteen. That's also consistent

56
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:38,251
with the intuition of adding negative three repeatedly

57
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,302
five times, now look above above us

58
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:44,769
slightly higher so you can see ideas of multiplying

59
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,272
two negatives, but we can do the exact same product experiment.

60
00:03:48,272 --> 00:03:52,033
We want whatever this answer to be consistent with the rest of mathematics

61
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:53,769
that we know so we can

62
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,347
do the same product experiment. What would negative two times

63
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:02,035
six plus negative six to be equal to.

64
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:05,012
Well, six plus negative six is going to be zero.

65
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:09,145
Negative two times zero, anything times zero, needs to be equal to

66
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:12,367
zero, but then once again, we can distribute

67
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:16,300
negative two times six so we get

68
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:23,621
negative two times six, then plus negative two times

69
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,102
negative six plus negative two

70
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:30,767
times negative six, then once again all of this is going to be

71
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:34,634
equal to zero, now based on the five experiment we just

72
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:37,569
did, we said "well this needs to be equal to negative twelve"

73
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,415
or we can view this as going to the six twice

74
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,501
left direction on the number line which gets us to negative twelve

75
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:48,433
or you could say repeatedly adding negative twos

76
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,003
times six would also get you to negative twelve and now

77
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:55,147
we also saw over here we want to multiply a positive and a negative

78
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:58,769
we got the negative so

79
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:02,501
this could be, you know, going to be equal to negative twelve

80
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,648
so we have negative twelve plus

81
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:08,234
whatever this business is

82
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:13,833
going to have to be equal to zero (repeated)

83
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:17,369
in order to be consistent with all the other mathematics that we know

84
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:21,621
and so what plus negative twelve is going to equal to be zero

85
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,101
Well, positive twelve plus negative twelve is going to equal to zero

86
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,835
so this needs to be equal to positive twelve in

87
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:31,564
order to be consistent with all the other mathematics we know

88
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:35,609
so there we get the idea that this is going positive

89
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:39,153
twelve. I'll leave you there and I'll see

90
00:05:39,153 --> 00:05:42,569
if I can make a few other videos that can also give you a conceptual understanding

91
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,569
of why these are true
