1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:08,067
Let's add something moving with a constant velocity of 5 m/s

2
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,512
and we're assuming it's moving to the right

3
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,533
just to give us a direction, because this is a vector quantity

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,022
so it's moving in that direction, right over there

5
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,506
And let me plot its velocity against time

6
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:24,133
so this is my velocity

7
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,759
I'm actually going to only plot the magnitude of velocity

8
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,544
and you can specify that like this: ||v||

9
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:33,333
so this is the magnitude of the velocity

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:39,600
And then, on this axis, I am going to plot time

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
So we have a constant velocity of 5 m/s

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,533
so its magnitude is 5 m/s, and it's constant, it's not changing

13
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,753
as the seconds ticks away, the velocity does not change

14
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:58,421
So it's just moving 5 m/s

15
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:05,533
Now, my question to you is: how far does this thing travel after 5 seconds?

16
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:12,200
So after 5 seconds, so this is 1s...2s...3s...4s...5s...right over here

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,400
So how far did this thing travel after 5 seconds

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,346
Well we can think about it two ways

19
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:30,024
1) We know that velocity is equal to displacement over change in time

20
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:33,920
and displacement is just change in position

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,867
so this is change in position over change in time

22
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:40,667
or 2) another way to think about it, if you multiply both sides by change in time

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:48,133
you get velocity times change in time, is equal to displacement

24
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,843
So what was the displacement over here?

25
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:55,425
Well I know what the velocity is, it's 5 m/s

26
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:59,892
5 m/s, that is the velocity (let me color-code this)

27
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:05,533
And we know what the change in time here is, it is 5 seconds

28
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,000
and so you get...the seconds cancel out with seconds...

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,533
you get 5 *5 = 25 meters

30
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,252
And that's pretty straight forward

31
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,898
but the slightly more interesting thing is

32
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:24,428
is that's exactly the area under this rectangle right over here

33
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:26,267
And what I want to show you in this video

34
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:30,600
that is in general, if you plot velocity, the magnitude of velocity

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,933
...so you could say speed versus time...

36
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,133
or let me just stay with the *magnitude of the velocity* versus <i>time</i>

37
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:41,773
the area under that curve is going to be the distance traveled (or the displacement)

38
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:46,696
because displacement is just the velocity times the change in time

39
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,691
so if you just take out a rectangle right over there

40
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,687
So let me draw a slightly different one where velocity is changing

41
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:55,933
so let me draw a different situation where you have a constant acceleration

42
00:02:55,933 --> 00:03:03,333
the acceleration over here is going to be 1 m/s/s, so 1 m/s^2

43
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,482
and let me draw the same type of graph

44
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:08,000
(although it's going to look a little different now)

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,625
So this is my velocity axis

46
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,867
(I'll give myself a little bit more space)

47
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,812
So this is my velocity axis

48
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,320
I'm just going to draw the magnitude of the velocity

49
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,800
and this right over here is my time axis

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,147
so this is time, let me mark some stuff off here

51
00:03:26,147 --> 00:03:31,575
so...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10

52
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:37,467
and...1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10

53
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,843
and the magnitude of the velocity is going to be measured in m/s

54
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:47,822
and the time is going to be measured in seconds

55
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,533
So what's going to happen here?

56
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,400
Assuming that we start with...

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,221
so my initial velocity, or I could say the magnitude of my initial velocity

58
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:02,951
so just my initial speed, you could say, this is just a fancy way of saying my initial speed...

59
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,206
...is zero

60
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:06,783
So my initial speed is 0

61
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,533
so after 1 second, what's going to happen?

62
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,467
After 1 second, I'm going 1 m/s faster

63
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,800
so now I'm going 1 m/s. After 2 seconds what's happened?

64
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,067
Well now I'm going another 1 m/s faster than that

65
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:22,133
After another second, if I go forward in time

66
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:25,667
if change in time is 1 second, then I'm going a second faster than that

67
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:30,348
And if you remember the idea of <i>slope</i> from your Algebra 1 class

68
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:34,841
that's exactly what <i>acceleration</i> is, in this diagram right over here

69
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:46,488
We know that acceleration is equal to...change in velocity over change in time

70
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:49,400
over here change in time is along the x-axis

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,333
so this right over here is a change in time

72
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,867
and this right over here is a change in velocity

73
00:04:55,867 --> 00:05:01,333
When we plot velocity (or the magnitude of velocity) relative to time

74
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:05,180
the slope of that line is the acceleration

75
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,200
and since we're assuming the acceleration is constant

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,933
we have a constant slope

77
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,867
so we have just a line here, we don't have a curve

78
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,590
Now what I want to do is think about a situation

79
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,775
let's say that we accelerate at 1 m/s^2...and we do it for

80
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:28,098
so the change in time is going to be 5 seconds

81
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,349
and my question to you is: how far have we traveled?

82
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,667
Which is a slightly more interesting question than what we've been asking so far

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,600
So we start off with an initial velocity of 0

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,169
and then for 5 seconds, we accelerate at 1 m/s^2

85
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,733
so 1...2...3...4...5...so this is where we are

86
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,147
so after 5 seconds, we know our velocity

87
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:53,071
our velocity is now 5 m/s

88
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,400
But how far have we traveled?

89
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
So we can think about it a little bit visually

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,556
we could say, look, we could try to draw rectangles over here

91
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:06,133
we were at, maybe right over here we had a velocity of 1 m/s

92
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:10,941
so if I say 1 m/s times a second, that'll give me a little bit of distance...

93
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,267
and the next one I have a little bit more of distance...

94
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,139
calculated the same way. I could keep drawing these rectangles here

95
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,135
But then you're like...Wait! Those rectangles are missing...

96
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,000
because I wasn't...for the whole second...I wasn't only going 1 m/s...

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,843
I <i>kept</i> accelerating, so actually maybe I should split up the rectangles

98
00:06:27,843 --> 00:06:30,415
I could split up the rectangles even more

99
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:32,165
So maybe I go, every half-second

100
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:34,733
so on this half-second, I was going at this velocity

101
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,733
and I go at that velocity for half a second

102
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,400
velocity times the time will give me the displacement

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,467
and then I do it for the next half second

104
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,333
same exact idea here, it'll give me the displacement

105
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,600
so on and so forth

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,133
I think what you see is your getting...

107
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:53,467
is the smaller the rectangles you try to make here

108
00:06:53,467 --> 00:07:00,662
the closer you're going to get to the area under this curve

109
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:09,556
And just like the situation here, this area under the curve is going to be the distance traveled

110
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:13,533
and lucky for us, this is just going to be a triangle

111
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,713
and we know how to figure out the area for a triangle

112
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:24,579
so the area of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height

113
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,000
which hopefully makes sense to you

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,133
because if you just multiply base * height

115
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,000
you get the area for the entire rectangle, and the triangle is exactly half of that

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,667
So the distance traveled in this situation

117
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,733
or I should say the displacement

118
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,080
just because we want to make sure we're focused on vectors

119
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,147
the displacement here is going to be

120
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:45,667
(or I should say the magnitude of the displacement...which is the same thing as the distance)

121
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:55,293
is going to be 1/2 times the base...which is 5 seconds

122
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:59,008
times the height...which is 5 meters per second

123
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:07,385
...times 5 m/s (let me do that in another color)

124
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,361
the seconds cancel out with seconds

125
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:13,400
and we're left with (1/2) * 5 * 5 meters

126
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,200
so it's (1/2) * 25, which is equal to 12.5 meters

127
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,110
and so there's an interesting thing here

128
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,908
there's a couple of interesting things

129
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:26,733
hopefully you realize that if you're plotting velocity versus time

130
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:32,267
1) the area under the curve, given a certain amount of time, tells you how far you have traveled

131
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:36,621
2) the other interesting thing is that the slope of the curve tells you your acceleration

132
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,362
What's the slope over here (left)?

133
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:41,200
Well, it's completely flat, and that's because the velocity isn't changing

134
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,579
so in this situation, we have a constant acceleration

135
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,695
the magnitude of that acceleration is exactly zero

136
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,762
our velocity is not changing

137
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:54,000
here (right) we have an acceleration of 1 m/s^2

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,356
and that's why the slope of this line right over here is 1

139
00:08:57,356 --> 00:09:00,933
the other interesting thing, is that even if you have constant acceleration

140
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:05,733
you can still figure out the distance by just taking the area under the curve...like this

141
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:09,133
so we were able to figure out...we were able to get 12.5 meters

142
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,862
The last thing I want to introduce you to...

143
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:13,400
(actually let me just do it in the next video)

144
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,979
and I'll introduce to you the idea of *average velocity*

145
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:18,486
now that we feel comfortable with the idea that

146
00:09:18,486 --> 99:59:59,999
the distance you traveled is the area under this velocity versus time curve
