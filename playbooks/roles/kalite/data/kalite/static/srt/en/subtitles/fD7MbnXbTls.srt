1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,290
Let's say we have the
indefinite integral of 1

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:15,300
over 36 plus x squared d x.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,910
Now, as you can imagine, this
is not an easy integral to

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,830
solve without trigonometry.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,130
I can't do u substitution, I
don't have the derivative of

7
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,480
this thing sitting someplace.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,340
This would be easy if I
had a 2x sitting there.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,910
Than I would say, oh the
derivative of this is 2x,

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,470
I could do u substitution
and I'd be set.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,880
But there is no 2x there,
so how do I do it?

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,640
Well, I resort to our
trigonometric identities.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,100
Let's see what trig
identity we can get here.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,840
The first thing I always do,
this is just the way my brain

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,920
works, I always like it-- I can
see this is a constant plus

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,350
something squared, which
tells me I should use a

17
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,300
trigonometric identity.

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,600
But I always like it in terms
of 1 plus something squared.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,210
I'm just going to rewrite my
integral as being equal to,

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,720
let me write the dx
in the numerator.

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,870
This is just times dx.

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,430
Let me write a nicer
integral than that.

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:07,370
This is equal to the integral
of d x over 36 times 1

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,800
plus x squared over 36.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,130
1 plus x squared over 36,
that's another way to

26
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,420
write my integral.

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,110
Let's see if any of our trig
identities can somehow be

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,400
substituted in here for
that that would somehow

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
simplify the problem.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,190
So the one that springs to
mind, and if you don't know

31
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,430
this already, I'll write it
down right here, is 1 plus

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,630
tangent squared of theta.

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,390
   

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,900
Let's prove this one.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,790
Tangent squared of theta, this
is equal to 1 plus just the

36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,210
definition of tangent sine
squared of theta over

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,160
cosine squared of theta.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Now 1 is just cosine squared
over cosine squared.

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,250
So I can rewrite this as equal
to cosine squared of theta over

40
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,990
cosine squared of theta, that's
1, plus sine squared theta over

41
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,860
cosine squared of theta,
now that we have a

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,320
common denominator.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,490
Now what's cosine squared
plus sine squared?

44
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,970
Definition of the unit circle.

45
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,210
That equals 1 over cosine
squared of theta.

46
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,600
Or we could say that that
equals 1 over cosine squared.

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,540
One over cosine is secant.

48
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,090
So this is equal to the
secant squared of theta.

49
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,270
If we make the substitution, if
we say let's make this thing

50
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,340
right here equal to tangent of
theta, or tangent

51
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,590
squared of theta.

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,310
Then this expression will be 1
plus tangent squared of theta.

53
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,700
Which is equal to
secant squared.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,860
Maybe that'll help simplify
this equation a bit.

55
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,080
We're going to say that x
squared over 36 is equal to

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,710
tangent squared of theta.

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,440
Let's take the square root of
both sides of this equation and

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:04,090
you get x over 6 is equal to
the tangent of theta, or that x

59
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,540
is equal to 6 tangent of theta.

60
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,950
If we take the derivative of
both sides of this with respect

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,140
to theta we get d x d theta is
equal to-- what's the

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,610
derivative of the
tangent of theta?

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,120
I could show it to you just
by going from these basic

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,070
principles right here.

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,670
Actually let me do it
for you just in case.

66
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,000
So the derivative of tangent
theta-- never hurts to do it

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,140
on the side, let me
do it right here.

68
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,470
It's going to be 6 times the
derivative with respect to

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,490
theta of tangent of theta.

70
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,050
Which we need to figure,
so let's figure it out.

71
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,040
The derivative of tangent of
theta, that's the same thing

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,030
as d d theta of sine of
theta over cosine of theta.

73
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,270
That's just the
derivative of tangent.

74
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,380
Or this is just the same thing
as the derivative with respect

75
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,520
to theta, let me scroll to
the right a little bit.

76
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,650
Because I never remember the
quotient rule, I've told you in

77
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,090
the past that it's somewhat
lame, of sine of theta times

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,560
cosine of theta to
the minus 1 power.

79
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,860
What is this equal to?

80
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,090
We could say it's equal to,
well the derivative of the

81
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,520
first expression or the first
function we could say, which

82
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,050
is just cosine of theta.

83
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,760
This is equal to cosine of
theta, that's just the

84
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,050
derivative of sine of theta
times our second expression.

85
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,660
Times cosine of theta
to the minus 1.

86
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,810
I've put these parentheses, and
put the minus 1 out there

87
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,610
because I didn't want to put
the minus 1 here and make you

88
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,590
think that I'm talking about an
inverse cosine or an arccosine.

89
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,680
So that's the derivative of
sine times cosine and now I

90
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,690
want to take plus the
derivative of cosine.

91
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,720
   

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,770
Not just cosine, the derivative
if cosine to the minus 1.

93
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:57,710
So that is minus 1 times cosine
to the minus 2 power of theta.

94
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,466
That's the derivative of
the outside times the

95
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:03,110
derivative of the inside.

96
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,060
Let me scroll over more.

97
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,620
So that's the derivative
of the outside.

98
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,160
If the cosine theta was just an
x, you would say x to the minus

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,360
1 derivative is minus
1 x to the minus 2.

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Now times the derivative
of the inside.

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,230
Of cosine of theta with
respect to theta.

102
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,180
So that's times minus
sine of theta.

103
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,350
I'm going to multiply all of
that times sine of theta.

104
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,690
The derivative of this thing,
which is the stuff in green,

105
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,550
times the first expression.

106
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,520
So what does this equal?

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,890
These cosine of theta
divided by cosine of

108
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,960
theta, that is equal to 1.

109
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
And then I have a minus 1 and
I have a minus sine of theta.

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,670
That's plus plus.

111
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,190
What do I have?

112
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,910
I have sine squared, sine of
theta time sine of theta

113
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,980
over cosine squared.

114
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,430
So plus sine squares of theta
over cosine squared of theta.

115
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,570
Which is equal to 1 plus
tangent squared of theta.

116
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,290
What's 1 plus tangent
squared of theta?

117
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:00,980
I just showed you that.

118
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,720
That's equal to secant
squared of theta.

119
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,100
So the derivative of tangent
of theta is equal to

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,410
secant squared of theta.

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,940
All that work to get us
fairly something-- it's nice

122
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,490
when it comes out simple.

123
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,440
So d x d theta, this is
just equal to secant

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,780
squared of theta.

125
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,440
If we want to figure out what d
x is equal to, d x is equal to

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,510
just both sides times d theta.

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,680
So it's 6 times secant
squared theta d theta.

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,290
That's our d x.

129
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,330
Of course, in the future
we're going to have to back

130
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,780
substitute, so we want
to solve for theta.

131
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,000
That's fairly straightforward.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Just take the arctangent of
both sides of this equation.

133
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,270
You get that the arctangent of
x over 6 is equal to the theta.

134
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,600
We'll save this for later.

135
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,640
So what is our
integral reduced to?

136
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,020
Our integral now becomes
the integral of d x?

137
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,210
What's d x?

138
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:06,430
It is 6 secant squared
theta d theta.

139
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,860
All of that over this
denominator, which is 36

140
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:19,380
times 1 plus tangent
squared of theta.

141
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,600
We know that this right there
is secant squared of theta.

142
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,420
I've shown you that
multiple times.

143
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,470
So this is secant squared of
theta in the denominator.

144
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,370
We have a secant squared on the
numerator, they cancel out.

145
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,990
So those cancel out.

146
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,400
So are integral reduces to,
lucky for us, 6/36 which

147
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,910
is just 1/6 d theta.

148
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,760
Which is equal to
1/6 theta plus c.

149
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,650
Now we back substitute
using this result.

150
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,240
Theta is equal to
arctangent x over 6.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,710
The anti-derivative 1 over
36 plus x squared is

152
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,220
equal to 1/6 times theta.

153
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:06,210
Theta's just equal to the
arctangent x over 6 plus c.

154
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,000
And we're done.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,770
So that one wasn't too bad.

156
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,144
