1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so here's a table that summarizes SN1 and SN2 Reactions

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the first thing that you should do is look at the structure of the akyl halides

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if its a primary alkyl halide its always going to proceed E and SN2 mechanisms

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
SN2 mechanisms require decreased steric hindrance in order for the nucleophile to function properly

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so primary alkyl halides have the-- are the least sterically hindered

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a primary alkyl halide would not react in an SN1 mechanism becuase

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an SN1 mechanism produces carbocations and a primary carbocation is

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not very stable, at all.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, for all these reasons, primary alkyl halides will be SN2.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Secondary alkyl halides are a little bit harder to figure out because

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it could be either SN2 or SN1

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so to break that pie, you have to also look at your nucleophile and your solvent.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you have a strong nucleophile and a polar aprotic solvent

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the last video we saw a polar aprotic solvent favor SN2 mechanisms

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you have a relatively weak nucleophile and a polar protic solvent

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thats going to favor an SN1 mechanism becuase the polar protic solvent

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will stabilize the resulting carbocation.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tertiary alkyl halides are always going to be SN1 because

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tertiary alkyl halides produce tertiary carbocations which are very stable

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
SN2 mechanisms wouldn't really happen for a tertiary alkyl halide

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because there'd be too much steric hindrance - too much stuff in the way.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay, so let's do a bunch of examples and see how to use this chart we've created here

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I start with this as my alkyl halide

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and im going to react an alkyl halide with water

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to heat up the reaciton like that

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the first thing you do - structure of your alkyl halide

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right this carbon is the one that's bonded to that bromine

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its connected to one other carbon therefore this is a primary alkyl halide

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
primary alkyl halides are always SN2, right so this is

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to proceed via an SN2 mechanism which we

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
know is a concerted mechanism. what is the nucleophile?

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well water is the nucleophile in this reaction.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
water is also the solvent making this a solvolysis reaction

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that might confuse some people because they say

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
oh wait this is a relatively weak nucleophile

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and its polar protic so why is it

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
proceeding via an SN2 mechanism

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the structure of your alkyl halide

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
always wins, so this is a polar protic solvent

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which does favor SN1 but since this is a pimary alkyl halide

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is only going to react via an SN2 mechanism although this reaction does occur

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rather slowly.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we know that the first still is our nucleophile

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to attack our partially positive carbon here

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at the same time these electrons kick off onto our leaving group

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so what will that give u s?

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is all a concerted SN2 mechanism so

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the water molecule is going to add the same time that the bromine leavues

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so our water molecule has now added to our original molecule

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here and lets see its going to have an extra lone pair of electrons

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and its going to have a positive one formal charge like that

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so what else is going to happen? alright well

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another water molecule is going to come along and instead of

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
functioning as a nucleophile, this time its going to function as

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a base, it needs to get rid of that +1 formal charge on the oxygen.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this lone pair of electrons is going to take that proton

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these electrons are going to kick in here on this oxygen and

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we would end up with ethanol as our products right

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two lone pairs of electrons on that oxygen and a hydrogen

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're lucky that we don't have to worry about stereochemistry for this reaction right

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there are no chirality centers created.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so ethanol is the only product in this reaction, so

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the approach is, first look at your alkyl halide and figure out what type of mechanism you're going to use

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then go to the problem with the mechnism thinking about possibilities for stereochemistry

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then you'll finally end up with your product

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so there's a lot of work involved in these but if you go through these problems with those steps in mind

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it'll make them much easier. let's look at another exmaple

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have this as our alkyl halide, so a bromine right here

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
notice stereochemistry is involved and

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're going to react that alkyl halide with sodium cyanide

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so Na plus, CN minus, and our solvent will be DMF

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we look at the structure of our alkyl halide first right

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the carbon connected to our halogen

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that carbon is connected to

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two other carbons making this a

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
secondary alkyl halide, we know that secondaryy alkyl halides

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can proceed via SN1 OR SN2 mechanisms

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we need to look at this nucleophile and solvent

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the nucleophile is cyanide anion which happens to be a relatively strong nucleophile

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our solvent is DMF and we saw in the last video that's a polar

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
aprotic solvent.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so polar aprotic solvent strong nucleophile

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is an SN2 mechanism

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is going to proceed via an SN2 mechanism

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that means as the nucleophile attacks

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know our halogen is going to leave

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so as this negatively charged carbon is going to attack

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this carbon right

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this happens at the same time the bromine leaves

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the bromine is on one side of the molecule

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the cyanide has to the attack from the opposite side of the molecule

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the steric hindrance part to an SN2 mechanism.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so when you draw your products, right when you show the Cyanide

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
substituting with the halogen there

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're goingt o show your CN going away from you in space

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
okay, because it has to attack from the opposite side of where the Br is

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
leaving

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you get inversion of configuration right

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
via your SN2 mechanism

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this will be the only product of this reaction

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets look at another one

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets actually start with the same alkyl halide, okay so here;s

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our sae alkyl halide

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this time we're reacting that with

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
acetic acid, so lets go ahead and draw acetic acid in here

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
alright so once again I

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so once again its the same alkyl halide I know its secondary

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the secondary alkyl halide, this time i have a somewhat weak nucleophile

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my nucleophile would be this oxygen here

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it has lone pairs of electrons on it like that

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it doesnt really have a negative one formal charge

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its not really that strong of a nucleophile- its also protic

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this would be the protic part of our solvent

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its going to function as our nucleophile and solvent

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we go back up here and we find polar protic solvent

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relatively weak nucleophile we'll proceed via an SN1 mechanism

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so an SN1 mechanism right you know the first step in an SN1 mechanism

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is formation of our carbocation so these electrons have to kick off onto our

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bromine right to form our carbocation

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this carbon right here ends up

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at a positive one formal charge that is a secondary carbocation

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so secondary carbocations have the possibility of rearranging but in this case

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
theres nothing that could happen

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to rearrange to make this one more stable tertiary carbocation

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so its going to stay as a secondary carbocation

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but always think about rearrangements being possible via SN1 mechanism

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a secondary carbocation, this is where

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our nucleophile is going to attack right so

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lone pair of electrons is going to attack right here

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to go ahead and jump to the product heres

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we're going to lose a proton after that attacks and we're going to get our products

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're going to add on the oxygen and this is an SN1

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mechanism, right the oxygen is going to attack from either above or below

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this planar sp2 hybridized carbocation here

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right so you're going to get a mixture of inversion of configuration and

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
retention of configuration as we saw in our SN1 video

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right so when this oxygen attacks it can attack from above or below

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if it attacks from this side right the oxygen is going to add onto here

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then let's see the rest of the molecule will look like that

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I already took the proton off in the mechanism just to save time

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's one possile product the other possible product

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
instead of the oxygen adding on as a wedge it can add on as a dash right
