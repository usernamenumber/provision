1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:09,200
Compare 156.378 to 156.348

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,800
so i assume they are asking which of these are greater

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,400
So let me write this 156.378 we want to

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,400
compare that with 156.348

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,200
I will go through it step by step even if you know it

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:39,800
Lets go to the hundreds place first

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,000
The 1 in the hundreds place represents this many hundreds

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We have 1 in the hundreds place in both the numbers

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lets go to the tens place, we have 5 tens which is 50

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,200
In both the numbers we have 5 tens which is equal

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Lets go to the ones place. we have 6 ones in both

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
the numbers which is equal again

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Lets go to the tenths place, 3 tenths in both the numbers

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,200
lets go to the hundreths place. We have 7 hundreths

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,400
in one number and 4 hundreths in the other number, which

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,800
has lesser hundreths.Lets go to the thousandths place

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,800
It is equal and does not matter if they are different

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,200
as in the hundreths place it is different.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,400
7 > 4 , so 7 hundreths is greater than 4 hundreths.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 99:59:59,999
So 156.378 > 156.348
