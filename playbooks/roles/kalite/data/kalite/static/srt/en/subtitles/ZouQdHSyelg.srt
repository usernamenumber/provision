1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,280
We're now going to take the
California Standards Test,

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,960
Algebra I released questions.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,480
In the last series, I had
done the Algebra II.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
I guess I'm going in
reverse order.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,110
Let me copy and paste this first
question because I think

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,905
it's good to see the
whole thing.

8
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:20,860
So let me see, I
have copied it.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,800
Let me move this pointer
all the way up, and

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,370
then, there we go.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,880
All right.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,060
And they're asking us is the
equation 3 times 2x minus 4

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,960
equal to minus 18 equivalent to
6x minus 12 is equal to 18?

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,770
So let's think about this.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,490
If we just distribute this
3, what do we get?

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,820
3 times 2x is 6x.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,770
3 times minus 4 is minus 12.

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,480
And that, of course, is
equal to minus 18.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,890
So sure, they're
the same thing.

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,290
If you just distribute the 3
over the 2x minus 4, you get

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,950
6x minus 12.

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,270
So the answer is
definitely yes.

23
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,140
It's not the no one down here.

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,540
And it says yes, the equations
are equivalent by the

25
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,080
associative?

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,340
No.

27
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,959
Communicative?

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,249
No.

29
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:09,033
The equations are equivalent by
the distributive property?

30
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:09,800
[FIRE TRUCK SIREN]

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,480
There's some type of a fire
truck going on outside.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,260
Let's see.

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,540
Where was I?

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,770
Oh, yes.

35
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,050
Yes, the equations are
equivalent by the distributive

36
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,760
property of multiplication
over addition.

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,470
Right, that's that.

38
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,400
We distributed this 3
over the 2x minus 4.

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,950
And they say over addition
because you could view this as

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,460
a plus minus 4.

41
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,540
Addition and subtraction is
really the same thing when you

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,180
think of the distributive
property.

43
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,740
Anyway, let's do the
next problem.

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,650
The next problem I can
just write out.

45
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,770
This is problem number 2.

46
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,550
They say the square root of
16 plus the cube root

47
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,120
of 8 is equal to?

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,975
Well, what's the square
root of 16?

49
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,680
And when you just have a square
root there, you might

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,830
say, maybe it's plus or minus 4,
but when they write it this

51
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,680
way is means the principal root,
so it's just plus 4.

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,590
They would write a plus or minus
out front if they wanted

53
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,520
you to get the negative
square root.

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,430
So it's 4 plus-- now, what to
the third power is equal to 8?

55
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,539
Well, 2 to the third power
is equal to 8, right?

56
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,950
So we could write 2 to the
third is equal to 8.

57
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,510
That's the same thing as saying
the cube root of 8 is

58
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,170
equal to 2.

59
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,570
You could also view this
as 8 to the 1/3 power.

60
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,490
Anyway, the cube root of 8 is
then 2, so 4 plus 2 is equal

61
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,140
to 6, and that is choice B.

62
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,390
Problem 3.

63
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,900
   

64
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,590
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,070
OK, and they want to know--
I could copy and

66
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,510
paste the whole thing.

67
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,200
   

68
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,910
There we go.

69
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,010
And they want to know which
expression is equivalent to x

70
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,790
to the sixth times x squared?

71
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,400
So x to the sixth times
x squared, they

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,390
have the same base.

73
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,470
When you're multiplying both of
these expressions, we can

74
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,390
add the exponents.

75
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,750
So that is equal to x to
the-- 6 plus 2 is 8.

76
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,640
That's not one of the choices
here, so we have to say, which

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,740
of these also are the same
thing as x to the eighth?

78
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,570
And so which two exponents when
I add them is equal to 8?

79
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,895
4 plus 3 is equal to 7.

80
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:20,330
5 plus 3, this is equal to
x to the eighth as well.

81
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,320
So that is choice B.

82
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,130
Next problem, problem 4.

83
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,740
All right, let me-- this is
another one where I'll copy

84
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,990
and paste it.

85
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,520
   

86
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,470
All right.

87
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,940
They want to know which number
does not have a reciprocal?

88
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,900
So the reciprocal of negative 1,
that's just 1 over negative

89
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,930
1, which is equal
to negative 1.

90
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,220
The reciprocal of
0, that's what?

91
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,700
1/0, which is not defined.

92
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,660
So the choice is B.

93
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,100
0.

94
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,500
We don't know what 1/0 is.

95
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,040
Maybe that's a project
for you to think of

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,290
what it should mean.

97
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,000
And, of course, these
have reciprocals.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,180
1 over 1/1,000 is just equal to
1 times 1,000 over 1, which

99
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,590
is equal to 1,000.

100
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,080
And the reciprocal of 3
is, of course, 1/3.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,330
Next problem.

102
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,480
   

103
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,140
They say-- so there's a lot of
terminology here, but I guess

104
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,040
that's good.

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,870
So they want to know--
let me just copy.

106
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,210
Maybe I'll do the
next one, too.

107
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,870
   

108
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,260
OK.

109
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,080
I could probably just
do it up here.

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,810
   

111
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,410
All right.

112
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,510
They want to know, what is the
multiplicative inverse of 1/2?

113
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,840
So essentially, what can
I multiply 1/2 by

114
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,325
and then get 1?

115
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:49,480
   

116
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,630
It's the same thing as saying
what's the inverse of 1/2.

117
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,630
So if I multiply by 1/2 by--
well, the inverse of 1/2, I'd

118
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,060
say 1 over 1/2.

119
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,760
That's the same thing
as 1 times 2/1,

120
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,230
which is equal to 2.

121
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:05,140
Or another way to think of it is
2 times 1/2 is equal to 1.

122
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,080
So the multiplicative inverse
of 1/2 is just 2.

123
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,460
That's choice D.

124
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,420
Problem 6.

125
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,160
What is the solution
for this equation?

126
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,070
All right, sometimes these
absolute value signs can

127
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,360
appear daunting, but
you just have to

128
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,650
think it through logically.

129
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,880
If the absolute value of 2x
minus 3 is equal to 5, that

130
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,730
tells us what?

131
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,210
That means that 2x minus
3 is equal to 5, right?

132
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,370
Because inside the absolute
value is equal to 5, then the

133
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,920
absolute value of
5 is equal to 5.

134
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,110
So that's fair enough.

135
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,190
But what could 2x minus
3 also be equal to?

136
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,680
What happens if 2x minus 3
within the absolute value sign

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
is equal to minus 5?

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,470
Well, then you would take the
absolute value of that and you

139
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,490
would get 5, right?

140
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:58,800
So 2x minus 3 could also
be equal to minus 5.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
When you see this absolute
value sign, you say, OK,

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,150
whatever's inside the absolute
value is either 5 or negative

143
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,960
5 because we're taking the
absolute value of it to get 5.

144
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,680
So we just solve both
of these equations.

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,390
If you add 3 to both sides
of this one, you get

146
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,200
2x is equal to 8.

147
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,570
x is equal to 4.

148
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,030
On the second one, you
add 3 to both sides.

149
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,306
You get 2x is equal to-- minus
5 plus 3 is minus 2.

150
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:30,645
x is equal to minus 2 divided
by 2 is negative 1.

151
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:35,450
So x could be equal to 4 or x
could be equal to negative 1.

152
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:42,160
And that is choice C, x is
negative 1 or x is equal to 4.

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,060
Next problem.

154
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,240
The Algebra I ones go faster
than the Algebra II problems.

155
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,110
Those tend to be hairier.

156
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,360
Let me clear all of this.

157
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,790
   

158
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,880
I'll just write this one down.

159
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,100
They say what is the solution
set for the inequality 5 minus

160
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,530
the absolute value of x
plus 4 is less than or

161
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,660
equal to minus 3?

162
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,730
So at first, this is
really daunting.

163
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,210
I can't even do that logic that
I did last time because I

164
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,040
have that 5 out there.

165
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,520
But let's think of
it this way.

166
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
Let's try to simplify it, so
we have just the absolute

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,410
value of something is
less than or equal

168
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,200
to something else.

169
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,540
So one thing we can do is, if we
want to get rid of this 5,

170
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,770
remember, what we do to both
sides of an equation or

171
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,340
inequality-- whatever we do to
one side of an equation or an

172
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,540
inequality, we do
to both sides.

173
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,690
So let's subtract 5 from both
sides of this equation.

174
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,940
If you subtract 5 from the left
side, this 5 disappears.

175
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm just going to do minus--
let me write that out.

176
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,750
Minus 5 plus, and I'm going
to do a minus 5 there.

177
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,690
   

178
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,240
That's a plus.

179
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,020
So minus 5 plus 5 is 0, so I'm
just left with minus absolute

180
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,690
value of x plus 4 is less than
or equal to-- now, what's

181
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,140
minus 3 minus 5?

182
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,850
That's minus 8.

183
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,290
All right, now this next step,
this is something-- maybe it

184
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,510
wasn't obvious for you and
putting the inequality there--

185
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,050
you know, if this was an
inequality, you would just

186
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,970
say, OK, I'm going to multiply
or divide both sides by

187
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,340
negative 1 to get rid of
the negative signs.

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,260
But one thing you have to
remember, whenever you

189
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,800
multiply or divide both sides of
an inequality by a negative

190
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,910
number, you have to switch
the inequality.

191
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,850
So if this is true, then if I'm
multiplying both sides of

192
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:38,950
this by negative 1, so negative
1 times negative x

193
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,840
plus 4, I'm going to switch
the inequality, so that's

194
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,210
going to become greater than
or equal to negative 8.

195
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,100
And I did the negative 1 on
this side, so I have to

196
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,480
multiply it times negative
1 on that side.

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,800
And so this negative cancels
out that negative, so we're

198
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,140
just left with x plus 4 is
greater than or equal to--

199
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,150
negative 8 times a negative
1 is equal to 8.

200
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,330
Now we can just use the
logic that we had

201
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,520
from that last problem.

202
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,530
This tells us what?

203
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,510
This tells us that the magnitude
of x plus 4 is

204
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,320
greater than or equal to 8.

205
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,110
Let me draw a number line here
because I really want you to

206
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,350
get the intuition of what
magnitude means.

207
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,680
So if that's the number line and
you can view magnitude as

208
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,150
kind of the distance from, or
the absolute value, you can

209
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,930
kind of view it as the distance
from 0, right?

210
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:40,500
So if this is 0 right here and
this is positive 8 and this is

211
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,540
minus 8, the absolute value of
whatever this quantity was is

212
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,780
greater than 8.

213
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,820
That means its distance from
0 has to be greater than 8.

214
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,490
You can just say distance from
0 of this number has to be

215
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,570
greater than 8, greater
than or equal to 8.

216
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,970
That means that this number is
definitely going to be greater

217
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,070
than or equal to positive 8.

218
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,880
On the number line,
it would be all of

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,340
those numbers, right?

220
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,620
Or, remember, we're saying the
magnitude, so we don't care

221
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,850
about the direction.

222
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,360
The magnitude has to be greater
than positive 8, so it

223
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,150
also includes the negative
numbers less than negative 8.

224
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,100
And why does that make sense?

225
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,160
Well, take negative 9.

226
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,580
What's the absolute value
of negative 9?

227
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:29,440
The absolute value of negative
9 is greater than 8 because 9

228
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,340
is greater than 8, so any number
to the left of negative

229
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,380
8 or to the right
of positive 8.

230
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,540
So what does that tell us
about this equation?

231
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,890
So that means that-- well, the
easy one is x plus 4 could be

232
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,235
greater than or equal to 8.

233
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:44,140
So let's write that down.

234
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,710
Let me write it here.

235
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,775
x plus 4 greater than
or equal to 8.

236
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:51,010
And that takes into
consideration that the

237
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,670
magnitude is greater than
or equal to 8 there.

238
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:00,160
Or x plus 4 less than
or equal to minus 8.

239
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,060
That's the magnitude
to the left of this

240
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,610
negative 8 right there.

241
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,570
And now we solve it.

242
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,050
And it's very important to think
of absolute value in

243
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,450
these terms. Otherwise, it can
become very confusing and you

244
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,250
start testing numbers.

245
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,630
But if you really just visualize
the number line and

246
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,000
you think of absolute value as
distance from 0, magnitude of

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,150
the distance from 0, you say,
oh, the distance from 0 has to

248
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,330
be greater than or equal to 8,
so that means my number has to

249
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,310
be-- this thing has to be less
than or equal to minus 8 or it

250
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,150
has to be greater than or
equal to positive 8.

251
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,420
So let's solve.

252
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,000
x plus 4 is greater than
or equal to 8.

253
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,250
Subtract 4 from both sides, so
you get x is greater than or

254
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,480
equal to 4.

255
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,440
I just subtracted 4
from both sides.

256
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,920
Subtract 4 from both sides here,
you get x is less than

257
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,570
or equal to minus 12.

258
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,700
So the solution here is x is
greater than or equal to 4 or

259
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,510
x is less than or equal
to minus 12, and

260
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,860
that is choice D.

261
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,420
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

262
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,400
