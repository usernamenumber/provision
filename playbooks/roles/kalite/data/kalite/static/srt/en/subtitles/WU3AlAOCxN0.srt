99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i used to exist in a simple world

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of right and wrong, positive and negative

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i grew out of an ordered world

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Before i came along and belonged nowhere

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i cannot be compared

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Neither greater nor less

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Nor equal to nothing

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now you see it’s plain

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i made the world complex

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i changed the rules

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
People said it couldn’t be done

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But i said, why not

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So many of you don’t bother to understand

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You’re dismissive

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Judging based of a name

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or a first impression

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That i must be fake, useless, false

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As if i were less real than anything else

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or worse, you mechanically embrace

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That which you don’t understand

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But you don’t care whether you understand

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As long as you can use, use, use

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The i that you imagine isn’t real, isn’t true

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All the pain when you finally come

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To that existentially horrific epiphany

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That nothing you understand is real

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually exists

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That your whole world of truth

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is some mega structure

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Resting atop the shoulders of tenuous assumptions

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How it hurts when you realize

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That what you thought you knew, and loved

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That simple, blind dependence

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How it hurts when you realize

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That the safety, and surity, of knowing everything is right

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is something you will never feel again

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How it hurts when you realize

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i can never be truly known
