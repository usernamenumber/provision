1
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:06,529
There is a classic story out there 
that has a character named Jack.

2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,186
You may have heard this story,

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:11,716
but I'm sure that there's a part of that story 
that you have not heard.

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:15,068
And so I'm actually gonna try to fill in those parts so that

5
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,847
you get a complete a idea of what happened.

6
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:25,340
Now, Jack came across, a long time ago, 
a famous, now famous, beanstalk.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,199
So this beanstalk has been growing and growing 
and have these huge leaves.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,567
And actually Jack used these leaves 
to make his way up this beanstalk.

9
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,568
So, this is how this beanstalk became very famous

10
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:43,833
because it basically allowed Jack to use it like a ladder.

11
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:46,214
Now, the part that we don't hear about is,

12
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,670
what was going on between Jack and the beanstalk?

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,998
He was exercising, right?

14
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:53,382
He was actually making a lot of carbon dioxide.

15
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:58,112
He is making a lot of this gas, this carbon dioxide gas,

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:03,258
as kind of a waste product, as he was running, 
scampering up the beanstalk.

17
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,665
And the beanstalk was helping him physically,

18
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:11,060
but also actually providing him with a very precious oxygen.

19
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:15,041
In fact, if the beanstalk didn't do that, 
he may not have even made it.

20
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:20,062
And we also... We don't know for sure but we think that perhaps

21
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:23,329
some of the story may have taken place during the day.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,309
And in fact, we know that sunlight is quite important 
for this process and we think that

23
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:34,540
this process... the name that we give it, 
for the beanstalk anyway, is photosynthesis.

24
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:40,339
And so, what is really happening? 
I'm actually kind of gonna write it out here,

25
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:45,598
between Jack and the bean stock? And really, 
between all plants and animals?

26
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,366
What is this process between them?

27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,708
We know that on the one hand, 
you have beanstalk doing photosynthesis,

28
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:56,750
and on the other hand, you have folks like Jack 
doing cellular respiration, right?

29
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,145
This is really kind of interesting simbiosis.

30
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:04,738
And by that, I just mean that the two 
are kind of relying on each other

31
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:09,151
to really work, right? So you kind of need 
both of them to work well.

32
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:12,486
And so, let's actually take a moment to write out

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,461
these processes that are happening 
between Jack and the beanstalk.

34
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:20,440
So let's start with the process of photosynthesis, the beanstalk.

35
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:27,097
So on the one hand, you've got water, 
'cause of course the beanstalk needs water.

36
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:30,940
And you've got carbon dioxide.

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,035
I'm gonna do carbon dioxide in orange.

38
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,430
So it's taking in water and carbon dioxide.

39
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:43,088
And it's going to put out, it's going to take these ingredients,

40
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:45,299
if you want to think of it as it's kind of cooking,

41
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:53,556
it's gonna take these ingredients and 
it's gonna put out oxygen and glucose.

42
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:58,520
I'll put glucose at top and oxygen down below.

43
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:03,647
So these are the inputs and outputs of photosynthesis, right?

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,408
And on the other side, you've got something very similar.

45
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:11,742
You've got inputs, you've got glucose and oxygen going in.

46
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,715
You're gonna see some serious similarities here.

47
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:18,109
You've got glucose and oxygen going in.

48
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:20,972
So, Jack is taking in those two things.

49
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:24,918
And he's again, of course, processing them.

50
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:31,439
And he's putting out water and carbon dioxide.

51
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:36,219
So, this looks really really nice, it looks perfect actually because

52
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:40,714
everything is nice and balance, and you can see 
how it makes perfect sense that

53
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:44,252
not only did Jack need the beanstalk, 
but actually it sounds like the beanstalk

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,182
needed Jack, based on how I've drawn it.

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,877
Now remember, none of this would even happen

56
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,389
if there was no sunlight. So we actually need light energy.

57
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:55,501
In fact, that's the whole purpose of this, right? Getting energy.

58
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,898
So you have to have some light energy.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,869
I'm gonna put a big plus sign, I might even circle it because

60
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,079
it's so important, I don't you lose track of it.

61
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:08,111
And on the other side, of course, 
Jack is getting something as well.

62
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:09,869
He's getting chemical energy.

63
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:13,702
In fact, he's using the chemical energy

64
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:15,845
to help him climb the beanstalk.

65
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:20,586
And so the chemical energy comes in 
the form of what we call ATP,

66
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,178
which is just a molecule of high energy.

67
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,529
And so, Jack is basically,

68
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:31,318
or Jack is actually going from light energy to chemical energy,

69
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,055
using these two equations. Now here's the part that 
people don't always appreciate.

70
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:39,258
And I'm actually gonna take just a moment to show you

71
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:43,930
that this isn't the full story, there's actually 
something else going on as well.

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,886
And that is that, there is actually 
some cellular respiration happening

73
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,926
on the plant side. So remember,

74
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,189
not only does the human or Jack need energy,

75
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,622
but so does the plant, right, the plant 
needs energy as well, and in fact,

76
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:04,462
if it takes in light energy right here, 
it needs to find a way to

77
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:07,540
eventually get some chemical energy itself

78
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,946
so that it can do all the things it needs to do.

79
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:13,471
You know, it doesn't need to run because 
plants don't move in that sense,

80
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,721
but it might need to make new roots, it might need to

81
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,543
make a flower and all these things take energy.

82
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:25,350
So actually, photosynthesis is happening during the day,

83
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:32,953
but at all times, plants are also capable of doing cellular respiration,

84
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:37,061
just like humans are, so humans and plants have actually

85
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,933
more in common than you might think.

86
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:41,467
So, this brings up an obvious question:

87
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,502
Why in the world would a plant sends

88
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:51,657
its glucose and oxygen this way where it needs it itself?

89
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,468
You know, why would it actually get rid of it?

90
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:57,171
Well the truth is that, the glucose ends up often times in

91
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:01,740
fruits and vegetables that we can eat, 
but as far as the oxygen goes,

92
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:06,285
it makes an excess of oxygen, 
so there is actually enough oxygen

93
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,894
to go both to us or to Jack,

94
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:14,660
and to be used by itself, so it actually has 
an excess of oxygen that it's making.

95
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:17,207
So that's actually kind of interesting, good to know.

96
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,495
Now if you think about it, if I was to...

97
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,606
Let's say sketch out a planet.

98
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,521
Let's draw a little, a planet over here.

99
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:28,586
And ask you the question, you know, 
if this was your planet Earth,

100
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,333
and you've got thousands, instead of just one Jack.

101
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,473
Let's say now you have thousands of Jacks 
and thousands of beanstalks.

102
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,873
In fact, not even thousands, let's say, billions,

103
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:41,195
because really, that's what we have, right?

104
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,284
We have a planet full of humans,

105
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,687
and full of other animals and full of plants.

106
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:49,364
What would the atmosphere look like? This is the atmosphere.

107
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:53,417
What would the atmosphere look like? Well, you guess,

108
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,878
that the atmosphere is, you know, gas.

109
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,547
What would those gases be?

110
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,752
???

111
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:06,809
It looks like I've got lots of oxygen and lots of carbon dioxide. So well,

112
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:12,291
I guess there must be, I don't know, 
maybe 50-50 carbon dioxide and oxygen,

113
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,049
based on what we know so far.

114
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:17,171
And the truth is, that's actually not true.

115
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,615
If you actually look at air,

116
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:23,183
you actually kind of break down the atmosphere or air.

117
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:26,745
I'm gonna write "air" here, you actually break it down.

118
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:30,829
It turns out that the ratio is actually 
a little different, so for example,

119
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,084
oxygen makes up about 21% of our air.

120
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:38,894
This is our air breakdown. Air.

121
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,660
And carbon dioxide makes up about less than 1%.

122
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:48,140
So, that leaves you wondering 
what the heck is making up all that other

123
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:51,375
parts of the air? What does it made of?

124
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,097
And it turns out about 78% is nitrogen.

125
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:00,845
Now you know, you've got nitrogen in your protein,

126
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:05,103
we've got nitrogen in our DNA; so nitrogen is part of us,

127
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:07,635
part of, you know, many many living things.

128
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:13,021
But nitrogen gas specifically is actually N2.

129
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:18,382
And N2, this nitrogen gas, really, it's not too reactive.

130
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,214
It kinds of just hangs out by itself.

131
00:08:20,214 --> 00:08:22,030
It does not like to react with things.

132
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:26,641
So, looking at our little atmosphere graph, 
you'll now think about it,

133
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,861
knowing that we've got very little carbon dioxide and

134
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,687
you know, about 21% oxygen. You could think of

135
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:35,188
oxgyen kind of being, let's say something like that,

136
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:38,385
well then, relative to that, nitrogen would be

137
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:44,154
you know, much more, right? You have 
much more nitrogen hanging out.

138
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:47,637
And so, this is really what our atmosphere looks like.

139
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:51,532
It looks more filled with nitrogen than anything else.

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,700
And, it turns out that carbon dioxide, it's just got a little ???

141
00:08:56,918 --> 00:09:00,690
maybe right there, that could be carbon dioxide, 
maybe even less than that.

142
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,743
So, this is really what our atmosphere looks like visually.

143
00:09:03,988 --> 00:09:07,551
And the nitrogen again, it's making up the majority.

144
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:10,488
And if you actually kind of wonder 
where all that nitrogen is coming from.

145
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,483
'Cause it's not mentioned in any of the equations, right?

146
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,103
Most of the nitrogen has been around...

147
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,042
Scientists think since the beginning of... 
When Earth even had an atmosphere.

148
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:24,385
And that nitrogen was just kind of 
carrying with us at all times and

149
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:26,906
that's why it just kind of remains at 78%.

150
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,511
It will probably remain there for many many years to come.
