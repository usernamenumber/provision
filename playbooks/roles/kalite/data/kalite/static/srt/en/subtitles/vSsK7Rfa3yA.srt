1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
   

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,000
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,050
Now let's do some more
mechanical advantage problems.

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,410
And in this video, we'll focus
on pulleys, which is another

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,260
form of a simple machine.

6
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,105
And we've done some pulley
problems in the past, but now

7
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,200
we'll actually understand what
the mechanical advantage

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,350
inherent in these
machines are.

9
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,370
So let me start with a
very simple pulley.

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,190
So this is the ceiling
up here.

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,000
   

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,780
I don't know what they call
that part of the pulley.

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,540
I should learn my actual
terminology.

14
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,840
But let's say I have that little
disk where the rope

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,170
goes over and it rolls so that
the rope can go over it and

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,120
move without having
a lot of friction.

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
And let's say I have a rope
going over that pulley.

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,600
   

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,610
That's my rope.

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,740
And at this end, let's say I
have a weight, a 10-Newton

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,730
weight, and I'm going to pull
down on this end to make the

22
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,160
weight to go up.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,410
So my question to you is what is
the mechanical advantage of

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,480
this system?

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,740
What is the force that I have to
pull down in order to lift

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,770
this weight, this 10-Newton
weight in order to produce 10

27
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,620
Newtons of force upwards?

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,985
Well, in any pulley situation--
and I don't know

29
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:17,380
if textbooks cover it this way,
but this is how I think

30
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,610
about it, because you don't
have to memorize formulas.

31
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,920
I just think about, well,
what happens to

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,150
the lengths of rope?

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,760
Or what is the total distance
that the object you're trying

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,000
to move travels?

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,310
And if you know the distance
that it travels versus the

36
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,040
distance that you have
to pull, you know

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,590
the mechanical advantage.

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,880
So in this situation, if I were
to hold the rope at that

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,670
point, and if I were to pull
it down 10 feet or some

40
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,350
arbitrary distance, what
happens over here?

41
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,300
Well, this weight is
going to move up

42
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,560
exactly the same amount.

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,250
Whatever I pull, if I pull a
foot down here, this weight

44
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,360
will move up by a foot, so the
distance that I pull here is

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,130
equivalent to the distance
that it pulls up here.

46
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,880
And since we know that the work
in has to equal the work

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,670
out, we know that the force I'm
pulling down has to be the

48
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,080
same as the force or the tension
that the rope is

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,530
pulling up here.

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,920
And we could have done that when
we learned about tension,

51
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,740
that the tension in the
rope is constant.

52
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,850
I'm producing tension in the
rope when I pull here and

53
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,480
that's the same pulling force of
the tension on the weight.

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,180
So this isn't too interesting
of a machine.

55
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,920
All it's doing is I pull down
with a force of 10 Newtons and

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,480
it will pull up with a force
of 10 Newtons, and so the

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,550
mechanical advantage is 1, no
real mechanical advantage,

58
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,940
although this could be useful.

59
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,590
Maybe it's easier for
me to pull down than

60
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,880
for me to pull up.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,810
Or at some point, maybe I can't
reach up here, so it's

62
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,930
nice for me to pull down here
where I can reach and the

63
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,260
object will keep going up
like in a flag pole or

64
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,160
something like that.

65
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,820
So this could still be useful
even though its mechanical

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,220
advantage is only 1.

67
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,270
So let's see if we can construct
a pulley situation

68
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,170
where the mechanical advantage
is more than 1.

69
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,810
So let's say over here at the
top, I still have the same

70
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,080
pulley that's attached to the
ceiling, but I'm going to add

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,766
slight variation here.

72
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,700
I have another pulley here.

73
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:32,315
And now let me do the other
pulley down here.

74
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:36,790
   

75
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,470
And then let me see if I can
draw my rope in a good way.

76
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,010
So my rope starts up going up
like that, then it comes back

77
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,820
down, comes around the second
pulley, and now this is

78
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,330
attached to the ceiling
up here.

79
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,280
The second pulley is
actually where the

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,660
weight is attached to.

81
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,750
And let's just call it a
10-Newton weight again,

82
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,610
although it doesn't really
matter what the weight is.

83
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,030
Let's figure out what the
mechanical advantage is.

84
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,430
So the same question.

85
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,930
And this is really the question
you always have to

86
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,850
ask yourself.

87
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,150
If I were take a point on this
rope and if I were to pull it

88
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,399
2 feet down, so let's see I take
this point and I move it

89
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,970
2 feet down, what essentially
happens to the rope?

90
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,480
Well, every point on the
rope's going to move

91
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,720
2 feet to the right.

92
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,640
I guess you can view it this way
if you view that motion is

93
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,330
to the right.

94
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,780
But if this length of rope is
getting 2 feet shorter, what

95
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,740
is this length of
rope getting?

96
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,410
Well, this entire length of rope
is also going to get 2

97
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,530
feet shorter, this entire length
of rope right here.

98
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,940
But this entire length of rope
is split between this side--

99
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,882
let me do it in different
color-- between this

100
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:58,050
side and this side.

101
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,420
So if I make this side of the
rope shorter-- I mean, the

102
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,660
rope goes through the whole
thing, but if I take this side

103
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,080
of the rope and I pull
down by 2 feet,

104
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
what is going to happen?

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,590
Well, this is going to
get 1 foot shorter.

106
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,840
This rope is going to
get 1 foot shorter.

107
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,960
This is going to go 1 foot
shorter and this length of the

108
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,590
rope is going to get
1 foot shorter.

109
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,440
And how do I know that?

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,070
Well, this is all
the same rope.

111
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,070
And if this is getting 1 foot
shorter, and this is one

112
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,950
getting 1 foot shorter, it makes
sense this whole thing

113
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,510
is getting 2 feet shorter.

114
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,520
But the important thing to
realize, if each of these are

115
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,200
getting 1 foot shorter,
then this weight is

116
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,110
only moving up 1 foot.

117
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,050
   

118
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,440
So when I pull the rope down 2
feet here, this weight only

119
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,850
moves up 1 foot.

120
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,320
So what is the work
that I'm doing?

121
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
Well, the work in is the same
as the work out, and we know

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
what the work out is.

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,100
The work out is going to
be the force that this

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,530
contraption or this machine is
pulling upwards with, and

125
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,070
that's 10 Newtons, so the
workout is equal to 10 Newtons

126
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,255
times the distance
that the force is

127
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:05,730
pulling in, times 1 foot.

128
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, why did I do feet?

129
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,000
I should do meters.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,920
   

131
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,565
That's not a good thing
for me to do.

132
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:15,170
That should be meters.

133
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,360
I shouldn't mix English
and metric system.

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,840
So 10 Newtons times 1 meter,
so it equals 10 joules.

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,310
And this has to be the
work that I've put

136
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,330
into it, too, right?

137
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,350
So the work in also has
to be 10 joules.

138
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,890
Well, I know the distance
that I pulled down.

139
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,280
I know I pulled down 2 meters.

140
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,100
So I pulled down 2 meters, so
this has to equal the force

141
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,890
times the distance.

142
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,360
So the force, which I don't
know, times the distance,

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,420
which is 2 meters, is
equal to 10 joules.

144
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,090
So divide both sides by 2, so
the force that I pulled down

145
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,270
with is 5 Newtons.

146
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,940
So I pulled down 5 Newtons for
2 meters, and it pulls up a

147
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
10-Newton weight for 1 meter.

148
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,780
Force times distance is equal
to force times distance.

149
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,800
So what was the input force?

150
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,050
The input force is equal to 5
Newtons and the output force

151
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,280
of this machine is equal
to 10 Newtons.

152
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,650
Mechanical advantage is the
output over the input, so the

153
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,110
mechanical advantage is equal
to the force output by the

154
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,400
force input, which equals
10/5, which equals 2.

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,970
And that makes sense, because
I have to pull twice as much

156
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:32,280
for this thing to move up
half of that distance.

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,520
Let's see if we can do another
mechanical advantage problem.

158
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,410
Actually, let's do a really
simple one that we've really

159
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,690
been working with a long time.

160
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,050
Let's say that I have a wedge.

161
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,760
A wedge is actually considered
a machine, which it took me a

162
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,220
little while to get my
mind around that, but

163
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,940
a wedge is a machine.

164
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,200
And why is a wedge a machine?

165
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,670
Because it gives you mechanical
advantage.

166
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,770
So if I have this wedge here.

167
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,580
And this is a 30-degree angle,
if this distance up here,

168
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,260
let's call this distance
D, what is this

169
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,630
distance going to be?

170
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,530
Well, it's going to
be D sine of 30.

171
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,540
And we know that the sine of 30
degrees, hopefully by this

172
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,520
point, is 1/2, so this
is going to be 1/2D.

173
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,190
You might want to review the
trigonometry a little bit if

174
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,800
that doesn't completely
ring a bell for you.

175
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,020
So if I take an object, if I
take a box-- and let's assume

176
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,280
it has no friction.

177
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,970
We're not going to go into
the whole normal

178
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,240
force and all that.

179
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,200
If I take a box, and I push it
with some force all the way up

180
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,200
here, what is the mechanical
advantage of this system?

181
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,670
Well, when the box is up
here, we know what its

182
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,220
potential energy is.

183
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,820
Its potential energy is going
to be the weight of the box.

184
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,510
So let's say this is
a 10-Newton box.

185
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,790
The potential energy at this
point is going to be 10

186
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,750
Newtons times its height.

187
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,540
So potential energy at this
point has to equal 10 Newtons

188
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,870
times the height, which is
going to be 5 joules.

189
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,380
And that's also the amount of
work one has to put into the

190
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,530
system in order to get it into
this state, in order to get it

191
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,380
this high in the air.

192
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,090
So we know that we would have
to put 5 joules of work in

193
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,260
order to get the box
up to this point.

194
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,490
So what is the force that
we had to apply?

195
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,490
Well, it's that force, that
input force, times this

196
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,310
distance has to equal
5 joules.

197
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,850
   

198
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,810
So this input force-- oh, sorry,
this is going to be--

199
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,610
sorry, this isn't 5 joules.

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,700
It's 10 times 1/2 times
the distance.

201
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,820
It's 5D joules.

202
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,480
This isn't some kind of units.

203
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,720
It's 10 Newtons times the
distance that we're up, and

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,610
that's 1/2D, so it's
5D joules.

205
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,860
Sorry for confusing you.

206
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,510
   

207
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,030
And so the force I'm pushing
here times this distance has

208
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,220
to also equal to 5D joules.

209
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,500
I just remembered, I
just used D as a

210
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,820
variable the whole time.

211
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,710
Dividing both sides by
D, what do I get?

212
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,780
The input force had to be
equal to 5 Newtons.

213
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,370
I'm dividing both sides
by D meters.

214
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,650
So I inputted 5 Newtons of force
and I was able to lift

215
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,370
essentially a 10-Newton
object.

216
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,410
So what is the mechanical
advantage?

217
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,390
Well, it's the force output,
10 Newtons, divided by the

218
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,195
force input, 5 Newtons.

219
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:34,120
The mechanical advantage is 2.
