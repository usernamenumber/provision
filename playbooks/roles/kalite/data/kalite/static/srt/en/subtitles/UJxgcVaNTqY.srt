1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's take a little bit of a
hiatus from our more rigorous

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,570
math where we're building the
mathematics of vector algebra

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,310
and just think a little bit
about something that you'll

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,080
probably encounter if you ever
have to have to write a

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,230
three-dimensional computer
program or have to do any

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,300
mathematics dealing with
three dimensions.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:26,880
And that's the idea of just the
equation of a plane in R3.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,120
And you know what a plane is.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,880
I mean we live in a
three-dimensional world and we

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,200
see planes all around us.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,580
The surface of your monitor, of
your computer monitor is a

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,910
plane, regardless of what
angle you hold it at.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,750
And I can draw here in
three dimensions.

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,400
   

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,840
Let me do a little bit
better job than that.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,220
So let's say that that
is the x-axis.

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,850
This is my y-axis.

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,110
And then that's my z-axis.

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,820
And we know what a
plane looks like.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,840
it looks something like that.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,950
I'm just drawing it at an
arbitrary angle and it goes

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,980
off in every direction.

24
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,870
Now, the equation of a
plane-- and you've

25
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,430
probably seen this before.

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,390
It's a linear function
of x, y and z.

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:18,450
So it's ax plus by plus
cz is equal to d.

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,720
If this is the graph on that
plane, then that means that

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,090
every point on this plane, every
x, y and z on this plane

30
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,085
satisfies this equation.

31
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:34,150
Now another way, just as valid
a way to specify a point or

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,480
specify a plane is to give you
an actual point on the plane.

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,670
So we'll say, look, that's
the point on the plane.

34
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,800
Let's say that this is the
point x0, y0, and z0.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,420
It could be one of the instances
of this point right

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,800
here, but I'm just saying
this is another point

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,260
that's on the plane.

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,940
That obviously by itself isn't
going to specify the plane.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,030
You could pivot the plane
around that point in an

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,470
infinite number of ways.

41
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,090
But if you specify that point
and you specify a vector

42
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,240
that's perpendicular to the
plane-- and I can draw that

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,460
starting from here, but I can
shift a vector wherever.

44
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,950
But let me just draw
it right there.

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,210
So if I also specify a normal
vector to the plane.

46
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,400
And I just used a word that I
haven't defined for you yet.

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,280
But when I say a normal
vector, so

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,280
n is a normal vector.

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,100
   

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,990
Or which just means that it's
perpendicular to the plane.

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,450
It's perpendicular to everything
on the plane.

52
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,680
It's perpendicular to every
vector on the plane.

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,270
Perpendicular to, I guess the
best way to say it, I'll just

54
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,850
say it in very imprecise
terms--

55
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,570
everything on the plane.

56
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,730
So if you have some vectors
lying on the plane, if I have

57
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,050
some vector here, let's say
that's lying on the plane.

58
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,960
If you imagine the plane as
a piece of cardboard, that

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,450
yellow arrow I just drew-- I
would've actually drawn that

60
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,240
on the cardboard.

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,670
It's sitting on the plane.

62
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,280
If this yellow vector, let me
call it vector a, then if this

63
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,970
is just some arbitrary vector
sitting on the plane and this

64
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,810
is the normal vector through
the plane, we know from our

65
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,810
definition of vector angles that
this is perpendicular to

66
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:23,090
this if and only if, n dot a--
only if the dot product of

67
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,350
these two things
are equal to 0.

68
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,050
And that's true for any vector
that we pick that actually

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,680
lies on the plane.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,470
So let's see if we can use this
definition of a plane, if

71
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,870
we can use the-- I'll call it
the normal or let me call it

72
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,700
the n plus-- let me
do it this way.

73
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:54,390
The n plus some x0,
y0, z0 definition.

74
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,950
And if I can go from that to
just the standard linear

75
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:07,010
equation definition, ax plus
by plus cz is equal to 0.

76
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,420
Let's see if there's some way
based on what we already know

77
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,730
and using this information
that we can do that.

78
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,350
So the way to think about it,
this point, this little blue

79
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,570
point that lies on the plane,
I can specify it

80
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,390
by a position vector.

81
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,950
So let me set some position
vector x0 to be equal to-- so

82
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,470
I'm going to define x0
to be equal to the

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,855
scalar x0, y0, z0.

84
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,630
And I want to be very clear.

85
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,240
This specifies the coordinate
that lies on the plane.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,750
This vector does not lie
entirely on the plane.

87
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,620
The way I drew it right here,
it's starting at the origin.

88
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,870
It's a position vector.

89
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,840
And the way I drew it it's
behind the plane.

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,180
The tip of its arrow
sits on the plane.

91
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,330
But this vector itself,
it's not necessarily

92
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,640
drawn on the plane.

93
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,210
This plane might not even go
through the origin, while this

94
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,270
vector does touch
on the origin.

95
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,300
It just specifies some
point on the plane.

96
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,440
Similarly, let me define
another vector.

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,210
I said this was some other
arbitrary point on the plane

98
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,800
xyz, and so you know,
this is true for any

99
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,380
point on the plane.

100
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,490
Let me define another vector
x, and I'm going to define

101
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,710
that as x, y, and z.

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,980
So once again, like x0, the
vector x-- let me draw it

103
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,790
right there.

104
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,690
This vector x does not
lie on the plane.

105
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,890
It goes from the origin.

106
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,260
It's a position vector
that specifies a

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,320
point on the plane.

108
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
So it goes from the origin
and it goes out.

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,200
And you can almost view them
as if the plane was like a

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,060
coffee table that this would
kind of be these vectors.

111
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,020
Let me see if I can draw it.

112
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,470
If this was the flat surface of
the plane that the vector

113
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,380
x0 is going from the origin
to specify some

114
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,180
point on the plane.

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,570
And then the vector x is also
going from the origin to

116
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,550
specify-- let me do it
in a different color.

117
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,410
The vector x is also going from
the origin to specify

118
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,970
some other point on the
plane right there.

119
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,870
I just took the plane and made
it flat, so you see it right

120
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,790
along its side.

121
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,240
If you could imagine sitting
right at the surface of the

122
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,170
plane and then you could see
that these guys clearly do not

123
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,680
lie in the plane.

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,460
But using these guys, I can
construct a vector that does

125
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,080
lie on the plane.

126
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,253
What does the vector x
minus x0 look like?

127
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:26,080
   

128
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,420
Well, I just drew a little
triangle here. x minus x0--

129
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,300
I'll do it in this
green color.

130
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,130
It'll look exactly like this. x
minus x0 will be this green

131
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,270
line right here.

132
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,670
This is x minus x0.

133
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,460
We could view x0 plus this
vector plus x minus x0 is

134
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,590
going to be equal to x.

135
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,345
If I were to do it on this
graph, it's going

136
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,130
to look like this.

137
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,540
It's going to be like this.

138
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,550
So let me draw it better
than that.

139
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,250
It's going to go from that
point from x0, the point

140
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,500
specified by x0 to the
point specified by x.

141
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,660
And it's going to lie
along the plane.

142
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,220
So this right here
is x minus x0.

143
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,110
I know this drawing is getting
very dirty, but you can see

144
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,060
that this is definitely
lying on the plane.

145
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:20,555
So this vector right here must
be perpendicular to n.

146
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:23,592
   

147
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:29,980
Perpendicular to our
normal vector.

148
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,150
Now, if my normal vector-- let's
say my normal vector n.

149
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,940
So this vector is perpendicular
to this guy

150
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,440
right here.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,770
It's perpendicular to the
vector n1, n2, n3.

152
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,260
Now using this information, how
can we get to this type of

153
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,730
an expression, just this linear
equation of x, y and z?

154
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,680
Well, we know that n-- let me
switch to a neutral color.

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,885
We know that n-- actually, I
didn't want to do this caret

156
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,950
here. n is not a unit vector.

157
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,170
But let's say n, so it's
perpendicular to this.

158
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,620
So the dot product of it,
we saw that right there.

159
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,600
We saw it in the
previous video.

160
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,640
The dot product of n with this
vector right here-- actually,

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,650
let me draw it.

162
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,740
You know, I already drew the
plane sideways, so I can

163
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,300
actually draw my n vector.

164
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,010
My n vector's going to look
something like this.

165
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,130
It's going to be popping
straight out of the plane.

166
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,320
And I could shift it over, but
it's always going to be in

167
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,030
that same direction.

168
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,300
It's going to be perpendicular
to this vector right here.

169
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,659
So n is perpendicular
to x minus x0.

170
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,450
   

171
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,260
Which means that their dot
product is equal to 0.

172
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,280
Well what does x minus
x0 look like?

173
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,240
So this is going to look
like this expression.

174
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,090
If I write out the vectors
themselves it's the vector n1,

175
00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:00,570
n2, n3 being dotted with-- well,
if I take x minus x0,

176
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,980
that's just the scalar x
minus the scalar x0.

177
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,740
The first term subtracted.

178
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,950
And then the scalar y
minus the scalar y0.

179
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,920
And then the scalar z
minus the scalar z0.

180
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,540
We know that this whole thing
has to be equal to 0 because

181
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,880
they're perpendicular.

182
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,756
And then if we take the dot
product here, we get n1 times

183
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:34,130
x minus x0 plus n2 times y minus
y0 plus n3 times z minus

184
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,510
z0 is equal to 0.

185
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,420
And you might not completely
recognize it, but this is--

186
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,960
you'll have to do a little
algebra to clean it up-- but

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:52,160
this is the form ax plus by
plus cz is equal to d.

188
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,570
And actually, I think I
made a mistake here.

189
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,110
This should be not 0,
this is equal to d.

190
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,160
This is the general form
for a plane in R3.

191
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,070
A plane is just a linear
surface in R3.

192
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,770
I shouldn't have written
a 0 there.

193
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,570
So this does take this form.

194
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,360
And if you don't believe
me, we can do it

195
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,020
with an actual example.

196
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,080
So let's say we have--
I gave you my

197
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,590
normal-- I specify a plane.

198
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,420
If I give you a normal vector
and I tell you that normal

199
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,110
vector is the point 1, 3, minus
2 and I say that it

200
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,840
intersects the point, or a point
that lies on the plane--

201
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,060
The normal vector and the point
don't necessarily have

202
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,140
to intersect.

203
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,920
But let's say for a point that
lies on the plane, I have the

204
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,380
point 1, 2 and 3.

205
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,920
And I say give me the equation
for this plane.

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,430
Well, I would say well, if I
take any other point on that

207
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,115
plane-- so if I take any other
point on that plane, xyz and

208
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:56,110
it's specified by this vector,
the vector that's defined by

209
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,190
the difference between
these two is going

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,840
to lie on the plane.

211
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,270
This point and this point
lie on the plane, so the

212
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,870
difference between these two
vectors, the whole vector will

213
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,190
lie on the plane.

214
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,180
Let me take the difference.

215
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:22,530
So x minus x0 is equal to x
minus 1, y minus 2, and

216
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,310
then z minus 3.

217
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm saying this will
lie on the plane.

218
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,800
This is on the plane.

219
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,230
And it's going to
be perpendicular

220
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,480
to our normal vector.

221
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,760
   

222
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,590
So if I dot my normal vector, 1,
3, minus 2, with this thing

223
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:51,000
right here, with x minus 1,
y minus 2, z minus 3,

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,660
I should get 0.

225
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,910
Because this has to be
perpendicular to anything that

226
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,710
lies on the plane.

227
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,320
So what do we get?

228
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,990
We get 1 times x minus
1 is x minus 1.

229
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,710
Plus 3 times y minus 2.

230
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,010
Just taking the dot product.

231
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,050
Minus 2 times z minus
3 is equal to 0.

232
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,380
Let's if we can do a little bit
of algebra here to clean

233
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,720
this up a little bit.

234
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:24,920
I get x minus 1 plus 3y
minus 6 minus 2z plus

235
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,870
6 is equal to 0.

236
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,400
And let's see.

237
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Minus 6 and a plus
6 cancel out.

238
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,380
And then I can take
this minus 1.

239
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,540
I could add 1 to both sides and
I get x plus 3y minus 2z--

240
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,300
add that 1 to both sidess--
is equal to 1.

241
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,750
And there you have it.

242
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,330
Just by using the simple fact
that this is a point on the

243
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,720
plane and this is a normal
vector, I was able to use the

244
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,930
idea that this has to be normal
or its dot product with

245
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,130
any point, with any vector that
lies on the plane, I was

246
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,570
able to get this right here.

247
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't have to go
through this whole

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,700
business right here.

249
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,450
You could have just used this
formula right here.

250
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:11,370
You could have just said n1
is 1 times x minus x1.

251
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,180
Or x0 I could call it.

252
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:23,260
So x minus this 1 plus n2, 3
times y minus 2 plus minus 2

253
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,070
times z minus 3 is equal to 0.

254
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,700
And then if you just did
a little bit of math.

255
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,130
a little bit of algebra, you
would've gotten there.

256
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,150
So hopefully find this
reasonable useful.

257
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,230
This is actually quite useful
if you ever have to do

258
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,660
anything that involves any
type of three-dimensional

259
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,520
mathematics.

260
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,970
And if you ever become a game
programmer this would be--

261
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,540
there's thousands of
other applications.

262
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,680
But this is kind of a useful
byproduct of some of the

263
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,740
formal mathematics that
we've been doing.
