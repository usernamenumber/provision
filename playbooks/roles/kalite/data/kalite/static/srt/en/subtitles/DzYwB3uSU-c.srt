1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:04,342
Let's say Pete over here thinks he is a pretty good investor.

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:05,608
So what he does is-

3
00:00:05,608 --> 00:00:07,083
or he has an idea that says:

4
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:08,816
"Look, I'm going to create a corporation,

5
00:00:08,816 --> 00:00:10,200
and I'm going to get a bunch of people

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,773
to contribute money to that corporation

7
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,095
and then I'll manage that money.

8
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,003
And then maybe I'll take a little fee for myself

9
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,333
so that I can, maybe, hire some analists

10
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:21,060
or get some computers, or get some office space."

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,800
So what he does is he sets up a corporation.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,587
Let's say he sets up a corporation right over here,

13
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:31,497
and let's say the first way he sets up the corporation is that it has 4 shares.

14
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:35,596
And I'm making the number really small just to make the drawing and the math easy

15
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:40,426
This wouldn't be realistic, normally it would be something in the 100s or 1000s of shares

16
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:41,680
or maybe even more than that.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,092
But let's say that it has 4 shares, and all of the shares are owned by Pete, initially

18
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,467
Just to simplify the explanation.

19
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:55,933
And he puts in $400 into this corporation.

20
00:00:55,933 --> 00:01:00,256
So another way to think about it, in exchange of him putting $400 into this corporation,

21
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:06,432
he gets 4 shares, or each share is worth $100.

22
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,590
Each of these shares, right over here.

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,209
So what he does is he registers this corporation, and I'm talking about a US-specific case

24
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,600
but there are similar types of organizations in other countries

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,400
He registers this organization right over here with the US SEC

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,924
Security and Exchange Commission, and he also registers himself with the SEC

27
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:33,739
or even better, he registers a management company that he runs with the SEC.

28
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:40,612
So let's call it Pete Inc. It's a corporation he starts off that he also registers with the SEC.

29
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,107
And when he registers with the SEC he tells them

30
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:48,275
"Look. This company over here, we're going to issue more shares, for more people to contribute money

31
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:53,290
And I'm going to manage this money right over here, and I'm just going to take a percentage of the total

32
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,544
assets under management"

33
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:58,538
Sometimes you'll just see AUM used, that just means Assets Under Management

34
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:04,064
That will go to Pete Inc. every year, for figuring out the best place to invest this money.

35
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:08,801
And it's usually on the order of 1%, sometimes a little bit less, sometimes a little bit more.

36
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,533
So 1%/year

37
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:16,533
Right now with only $400 under management, it would only be about $4/year

38
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:22,467
But since he registered with the SEC, he can call himself a mutual fund,

39
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:25,194
and he can solicit funds from the public.

40
00:02:25,194 --> 00:02:31,557
So it is a mutual fund, he has jumped through all the hoops that the SEC sets up for him,

41
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:37,222
so he can market himself as some type of great fund manager,

42
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,133
We don't know if that's true or not,

43
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:42,470
and he can also solicit funds from the public.

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,814
So from the public

45
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,507
And we're going to see in future videos there are other funds, especially hedge funds,

46
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:51,867
that one, they can't market, and they can't take funds from the public.

47
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:56,123
Those can only take funds from certain types of sophisticated investors.

48
00:02:56,123 --> 00:03:00,489
and what happens in Pete's fund, and this is going to be an open ended mutual fund

49
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,400
that we're showing here, and most mutual funds are like that.

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,805
Let's say Sal comes along, he likes Pete's marketing materials, and says

51
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:10,148
"Hey! I want Pete to manage my money, too"

52
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:14,792
So sal goes and gives $100, and says "Pete, give me a share"

53
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:20,876
So Pete creates another share right over here, he gives it to Sal,

54
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:26,727
That's me, so I get one share, and in exchange I gave $100 to the fund.

55
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,814
So now the fund has $500.

56
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,879
So this is another $100 right over here

57
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,574
And now Pete's annual fee is going to be 1% of this whole thing, or $5/year

58
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:41,867
And if this whole thing grows, let's say this whole thing doubles,

59
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:50,267
From $500, let's say it goes to $1000, then that $1000 is now essentially split among these 5 shares now.

60
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:53,895
So all of the people will essentially have their money doubled

61
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,867
minus whatever Pete's expenses are.

62
00:03:55,867 --> 99:59:59,999
in the next few videos I'll go over a little bit more of the mechanics of an open ended mutual fund.
