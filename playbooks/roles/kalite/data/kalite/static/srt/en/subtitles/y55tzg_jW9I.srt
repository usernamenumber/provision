1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:03,924
In the last couple of videos we talked about reflection.

2
00:00:03,924 --> 00:00:08,600
And that's just the idea of the light rays bouncing off of a surface.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:17,067
And if the surface is smooth, the incident angle is going to be the same thing as the reflected angle.

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:21,266
We saw that before, and those angles are measured relative to a perpendicular.

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,953
So that angle right there is going to be the same as that angle right there.

6
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:27,041
That's essentially what we learned the last couple of videos.

7
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,002
What we want to cover in this video is

8
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,645
when the light actually doesn't just bounce off of a surface

9
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,629
but starts going through a different medium.

10
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:39,390
So in this situation, we will be dealing with refraction.

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:46,321
Refraction. Refraction, you still have the light coming in to the interface between the two surfaces.

12
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:50,059
So let's say--so that's the perpendicular right there,

13
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,392
actually let me continue the perpendicular all the way down like that.

14
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:59,613
And let's say we have the incident light ray coming in at some, at some angle theta 1,

15
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:04,182
just like that...what will happen--and so let's say that this up here, this is a vacuum.

16
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:06,777
Light travels the fastest in a vacuum.

17
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:12,054
In a vacuum. There's nothing there, no air, no water, no nothing, that's where the light travels the fastest.

18
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:17,438
And let's say that this medium down here, I don't know, let's say it's water.

19
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:19,452
Let's say that this is water.

20
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,618
All of this. This was all water over here.

21
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,905
This was all vacuum right up here.

22
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:30,921
So what will happen, and actually, that's kind of an unrealistic--

23
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,408
well, just for the sake of argument, let's say we have water going right up against a vacuum.

24
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:38,725
This isn't something you would normally just see in nature

25
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,931
but let's just think about it a little bit.

26
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:44,515
Normally, the water, since there's no pressure, it would evaporate and all the rest.

27
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:48,813
But for the sake of argument, let's just say that this is a medium where light will travel slower.

28
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:51,464
What you're going to have is

29
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:55,587
is this ray is actually going to switch direction, it's actually going to bend.

30
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:59,315
Instead of continuing to go in that same direction, it's going to bend a little bit.

31
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:02,875
It's going to go down, in that direction

32
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:06,623
just like that. And this angle right here, theta 2,

33
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:15,838
is the refraction. That's the refraction angle. Refraction angle.

34
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:20,171
Or angle of refraction. This is the incident angle, or angle of incidence,

35
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:24,854
and this is the refraction angle. Once again, against that perpendicular.

36
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:28,100
And before I give you the actual equation of how these two things relate

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,490
and how they're related to the speed of light in these two media--

38
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,038
and just remember, once again, you're never going to have vacuum against water,

39
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:37,546
the water would evaporate because there's no pressure on it and all of that type of thing.

40
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:41,008
But just to--before I go into the math of actually how to figure out these angles

41
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,992
relative to the velocities of light in the different media

42
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:47,202
I want to give you an intuitive understanding of

43
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:50,264
not why it bends, 'cause I'm not telling you actually how light works

44
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:51,967
this is really more of an observed property

45
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:54,500
and light, as we'll learn, as we do more and more videos about it,

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,723
can get pretty confusing.

47
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:59,002
Sometimes you want to treat it as a ray, sometimes you want to treat it as a wave,

48
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:01,238
sometimes you want to treat it as a photon.

49
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:02,802
But when you think about refraction

50
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,854
I actually like to think of it as kind of a, as a bit of a vehicle,

51
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:10,879
and to imagine that, let's imagine that I had a car.

52
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,223
So let me draw a car. So we're looking at the top of a car.

53
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:17,864
So this is the passenger compartment, and it has four wheels on the car.

54
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,659
We're looking at it from above.

55
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,171
And let's say it's traveling on a road.

56
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,479
It's traveling on a road. On a road, the tires can get good traction.

57
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,090
The car can move pretty efficiently, and it's about to reach an interface

58
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,454
it's about to reach an interface where the road ends and it will have to travel

59
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:41,469
on mud. It will have to travel on mud. Now on mud, obviously, the tires' traction

60
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:46,171
will not be as good. The car will not be able to travel as fast. So what's going to happen?

61
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:49,469
Assuming that the car, the steering wheel isn't telling it to turn or anything,

62
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,515
the car would just go straight in this direction.

63
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:56,413
But what happens right when--which wheels are going to reach

64
00:03:56,413 --> 00:04:01,541
the mud first? Well, this wheel. This wheel is going to reach the mud first.

65
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,490
So what's going to happen? There's going to be some point in time

66
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,664
where the car is right over here. Where it's right over here.

67
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,771
Where these wheels are still on the road, this wheel is in the mud,

68
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:13,152
and that wheel is about to reach the mud.

69
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,767
Now in this situation, what would the car do?

70
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:20,633
What would the car do? And assuming the engine is revving and the wheels are turning,

71
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:29,377
at the exact same speed the entire time of the simulation.

72
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:34,725
Well all of a sudden, as soon as this wheel hits the medium, it's going to slow down.

73
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:37,767
This is going to slow down. But these guys are still on the road.

74
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,952
So they're still going to be faster.

75
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:43,782
So the right side of the car is going to move faster than the left side of the car.

76
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:46,013
So what's going to happen?

77
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:49,956
You see this all the time. If the right side of you is moving faster than the left side of you,

78
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,229
you're going to turn, and that's exactly what's going to happen to the car.

79
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,787
The car is going to turn. It's going to turn in that direction.

80
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:02,433
And so once it gets to the medium, it will now travel, it will now turn--

81
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,362
from the point of the view from the car it's turning to the right.

82
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:09,664
But it will now travel in this direction. It will be turned when it gets to that interface.

83
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:13,125
Now obviously light doesn't have wheels, and it doesn't deal with mud.

84
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:17,295
But it's the same general idea. When I'm traveling from a faster medium

85
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:21,721
to a slower medium, you can kind of imagine the wheels on that light

86
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,356
on this side of it, closer to the vertical, hit the medium first, slow down,

87
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:27,752
so light turns to the right.

88
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:35,362
If you were going the other way, if I had light coming out of the slow medium,

89
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:39,202
so let's imagine it this way. Let's have light coming out of the slow medium.

90
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:47,510
And if we use the car analogy, in this situation, the left side of the car is going to--

91
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,782
so if the car is right over here, the left side of the car is going to come out first

92
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:58,854
so it's going to move faster now. So the car is going to turn to the right, just like that.

93
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:04,136
So hopefully, hopefully this gives you a gut sense of just how to figure out which direction

94
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,762
the light's going to bend if you just wanted an intuitive sense.

95
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:11,229
And to get to the next level, there's actually something called Snell's Law.

96
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,454
Snell's Law.

97
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:21,423
Snell's Law. And all this is saying is that this angle--

98
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:26,264
so let me write it down here--so let's say that this velocity right here is velocity 2

99
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:29,264
this velocity up here was velocity 1, going back to the original.

100
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:33,162
Actually, let me draw another diagram, just to clean it up.

101
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:36,925
And also that vacuum-water interface example, I'm not enjoying it,

102
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:40,679
just because it's a very unnatural interface to actually have in nature.

103
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:44,767
So maybe it's vacuum and glass. That's something that actually would exist.

104
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:51,156
So let's say we're doing that. So this isn't water, this is glass. Let me redraw it.

105
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:53,364
And I'll draw the angles bigger.

106
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:57,125
So let me draw a perpendicular.

107
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,377
And so I have our incident ray,

108
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:04,531
so in the vacuum

109
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,869
it's traveling at v1--and in the case of a vacuum,

110
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:09,854
it's actually going at the speed of light, or the speed of light in a vacuum,

111
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:13,757
which is c, or 300,000 kilometers per second,

112
00:07:13,757 --> 00:07:18,536
or 300 million meters per second--let me write that--

113
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,725
so c is the speed of light in a vacuum,

114
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,762
and that is equal to 300--

115
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:27,008
it's not exactly 300, I'm not going into significant digits--

116
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:31,685
this is true to three significant digits--300 million meters per second.

117
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,731
This is light in a vacuum.

118
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,500
Light in vacuum. And I don't mean the thing that you use to clean your carpet with,

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,464
I mean an area of space that has nothing in it.

120
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:45,952
No air, no gas, no molecules, nothing in it. That is a pure vacuum

121
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,962
and that's how fast light will travel.

122
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:52,715
Now it's travelling really fast there, and let's say that--and this applies to any two mediums--

123
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:57,577
but let's say it gets to glass here, and in glass it travels slower,

124
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,875
and we know for our example, this side of the car

125
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,300
is going to get to the slower medium first

126
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,705
so it's going to turn in this direction.

127
00:08:03,705 --> 00:08:07,177
So it's going to go like this.

128
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,264
We call this v2.

129
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:11,029
Maybe I'll draw it--if you wanted to view these as

130
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,762
vectors, maybe I should draw it as a smaller vector

131
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,679
v2, just like that.

132
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:19,685
And the angle of incidence is theta 1.

133
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:23,952
And the angle of refraction is theta 2.

134
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:27,479
And Snell's Law just tells us

135
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,900
the ratio between v2 and the sin--

136
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,382
remember Soh Cah Toa, basic trig function--

137
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:37,859
and the sin of the angle of refraction

138
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:45,331
is going to be equal to the ratio of v1 and

139
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:49,054
the angle--the sin of the angle of incidence.

140
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,936
Sin of theta 1.

141
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,377
Now if this looks confusing at all, we're going to

142
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,971
apply it a bunch in the next couple of videos.

143
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:55,895
But I want to show you also that

144
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:58,613
there's many many ways to view Snell's Law.

145
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,562
You may or may not be familiar with the idea of

146
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:03,746
an index of refraction.

147
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:05,398
So let me write that down.

148
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,115
Index of refraction.

149
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,398
Index, or refraction index.

150
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,771
And it's defined for any medium, for any material.

151
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,438
There's an index of refraction for vacuum, for air,

152
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,095
for water.

153
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,233
For any material that people have measured it for.

154
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:24,685
And they usually specify it as n.

155
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:28,721
And it is defined as the speed of light in a vacuum

156
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:36,377
That's c. Divided by the velocity of light in that medium.

157
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:40,315
So in our example right here, we could rewrite this.

158
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,131
We could rewrite this in terms of index of refraction.

159
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,167
Let me do that actually. Just cause that's sometimes

160
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,254
the more typical way of viewing Snell's Law.

161
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,956
So I could solve for v here if I--one thing I could do

162
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,910
is just--if n is equal to c divided by v

163
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,392
then v is going to be equal to c divided by n.

164
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:01,208
And I can multiply both sides by v

165
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,492
if you don't see how I got there.

166
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:05,423
The intermediary step is, multiply both sides times v,

167
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,562
you get v times n is equal to c, and then

168
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:10,046
you divide both sides by n, you get

169
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:12,038
v is equal to c over n.

170
00:10:12,038 --> 00:10:16,521
So I can rewrite Snell's Law over here as

171
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:21,552
instead of having v2 there, I could write

172
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,244
instead of writing v2 there I could write

173
00:10:23,244 --> 00:10:28,382
the speed of light divided by the refraction index

174
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,100
for this material right here.

175
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,946
So I'll call that n2.

176
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:36,336
Right, this is material 2, material 2 right over there.

177
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,359
Right, that's the same thing as

178
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:44,792
v2 over the sin of theta 2

179
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:52,582
is equal to v1 is the same thing as c divided by n1

180
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:58,085
over sin of theta 1. And then we could do a little bit

181
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:01,238
of simplification here, we can multiple both sides of

182
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:04,156
this equation--well, let's do a couple of things. Let's--

183
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:06,418
Actually, the simplest thing to do is actually

184
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:08,543
take the reciprocal of both sides.

185
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,797
So let me just do that.

186
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,013
So let me take the reciprocal of both sides,

187
00:11:11,013 --> 00:11:21,500
and you get sin of theta 2 over cn2 is equal to

188
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:30,054
sin of theta 1 over c over n1.

189
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:31,492
And now let's multiply the numerator and

190
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,623
denominator of this left side by n2.

191
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:37,362
So if we multiply n2 over n2.

192
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,077
We're not changing it,

193
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,002
this is really just going to be 1,

194
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:41,838
but this guy and this guy are going to cancel out.

195
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,031
And let's do the same thing over here,

196
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:44,438
multiply the numerator and the denominator

197
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:48,156
by n1, so n1 over n1.

198
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,136
That guy, that guy, and that guy

199
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,531
are going to cancel out.

200
00:11:51,531 --> 00:12:01,664
And so we get n2 sin of theta 2 over c is equal to

201
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:06,700
n1 sin of theta 1 over c.

202
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,967
And now we can just multiply both sides

203
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,982
of this equation by c and we get the form of

204
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:13,971
Snell's Law that some books will show you,

205
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:16,736
which is the refraction index for the slower medium,

206
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,869
or for the second medium, the one that we're entering,

207
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:23,269
times the index of the sin of the index of refraction

208
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,941
is equal to

209
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,279
the refraction index for the first medium

210
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,956
times the sin of the angle of incidence.

211
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,079
The incident angle.

212
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,295
So this is another version right here

213
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,440
This is another version right there of Snell's Law.

214
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,956
Let me copy and paste that.

215
00:12:39,956 --> 00:12:41,613
And if this is confusing to you,

216
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:43,267
and I'm guessing that it might be,

217
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,254
especially if this is the first time you're seeing it,

218
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:47,046
we're going to apply this in a bunch of videos,

219
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,931
in the next few videos, but I really just want to make sure,

220
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,479
I really just want to make sure you're comfortable with it.

221
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:55,085
So these are both equivalent forms of Snell's Law.

222
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:58,121
One deals with the velocities, directly deals with

223
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,469
the velocities, right over here,

224
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:02,705
the ratio of the velocity to the sin of the incident

225
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:03,836
or refraction angle

226
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:07,095
and here it uses the index of refraction.

227
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:09,941
And the index of refraction really just tells you

228
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:13,515
it's just the ratio of the speed of light to the actual velocity.

229
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:16,833
So something where light travels really slowly

230
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,556
where light travels really slowly,

231
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,618
this will be a smaller number.

232
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:22,610
And if this is a smaller number,

233
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,971
this is a larger number.

234
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,038
And we actually see it here.

235
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,500
And you're going to see a little tidbit of the next video

236
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,323
right over here.

237
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:33,402
But here's a bunch of refraction indices

238
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:34,548
for different materials.

239
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:38,202
It's obviously 1 for a vacuum, because for a vacuum

240
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:40,238
you have the refraction index is going to be c

241
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:43,033
divided by the speed of light in that material.

242
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,756
Well, in a vacuum it's traveling at c.

243
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,387
So it's going to be 1.

244
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:50,121
So that's where that came from. And you can see in air,

245
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,971
the speed is only slightly smaller,

246
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:54,998
this number's only going to be slightly smaller

247
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,556
than the speed of light in a vacuum.

248
00:13:56,556 --> 00:13:59,315
So in air, it's still pretty close to a vacuum.

249
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:03,382
But then for a diamond, it's traveling a lot slower.

250
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:05,146
Light is travelling a lot slower in a diamond

251
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:08,023
than it is in a vacuum.

252
00:14:08,023 --> 00:14:08,646
Anyway, I'll leave you there,

253
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,408
we're going to do a couple more videos,

254
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:12,582
we're going to do more examples using Snell's Law.

255
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:14,990
Hopefully you got the basic idea of refraction.

256
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,459
And in the next video, I'll actually use this graphic right here to help us visualize

257
00:14:19,459 --> 99:59:59,999
why it looks like the straw got bent.
