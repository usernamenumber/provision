1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:03,675
Let's say that the settlement price for delivering one thousand pounds of

2
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:07,698
Apples one October Twentieth -- which we’re going to assume is one year

3
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:11,701
From now -- Let's assume that it's two hundred dollars. Let's also assume

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:15,791
That the current market price for a thousand pounds of apples is

5
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:19,264
Also two hundred dollars. So that future settlement price

6
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:23,800
Is the same as the current market price. And we're also going to assume, like the last

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,492
Example, that these apples that we have never go bad. They're just things that --

8
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:31,072
They'd never rot or anything. 
So there as good in year as they are right now

9
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,570
Let’s also assume that above and beyond the assumptions of the last video

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:39,143
That we can borrow and sell apples in the current market we can actually

11
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:43,041
Short apples. And when I borrow -- So I go to someone who's got a thousand pounds

12
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,790
Of apples who don't really see any need for them over the next year. And I say, “Can I borrow

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,633
Those apples?” and what I do is I say I’ll borrow those apples I'll sell

14
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,501
Those apples in the market today and of the interest that I’d get

15
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:58,634
On those apples, I'm going to give you one percent -- the person who

16
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:01,897
Actually owns the apples and that person says, “Oh sure. Why not?"

17
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:06,112
That way I actually get some money on my apples that I had no intention of using for a

18
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:10,361
Year and that is the borrower and seller will get four percent

19
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,633
Net. I'll get four percent net on the apples

20
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,947
So given that this the reality of what could I do once again to make a

21
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:21,970
Risk-free profit? Well, as you can imagine,

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,196
I can borrow and sell the apples for a year so let me write this down.

23
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,618
I'm going to borrow and sell

24
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:33,429
One thousand pounds of apples. One thousand pounds

25
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,848
Of apples. So, if I just borrow it today and sell it,

26
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,297
Today's market price is two hundred dollars for a thousand pounds.

27
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:45,697
So I’m going to get -- I’m going to get two hundred

28
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:49,514
I'm going to get two hundred dollars. Now on top of

29
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:52,977
That, what I want to do is agreed to be the buyer

30
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,102
I want to a agree to be the buyer on this futures contract.

31
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:01,290
So let me write that down. Agree you could say the go

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,951
Long on this futures contract or agree to be buyer.

33
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:09,004
To be buyer on the futures

34
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,635
Contract. On the futures contract. So I'm

35
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:16,421
Agreeing, a year from now, to buy a thousand pounds of apples

36
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,380
For two hundred dollars. So let’s fast forward, let’s fast forward

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,296
One year. So what's happened? So of the two hundred dollars I got

38
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:28,168
From shorting the apples, I got five percent on that. But I had to give

39
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:31,976
One percent to the person I borrowed the apples from. So I’m getting four

40
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,106
Percent net. Four percent on two hundred dollars is

41
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:38,819
Eight dollars. So I now have and I now have

42
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,705
Two hundred and eight dollars because I got but four percent interest

43
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,236
It was two hundred and ten. I gave two dollars to the person who lent me

44
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:51,185
The apples. Now I can use two hundred dollars of that

45
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:55,272
To essentially uphold my part of the future's contract

46
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,565
To buy the apples for two hundred dollars, for that agreed upon price.

47
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:03,103
So two hundred dollars -- two hundred dollars

48
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:06,822
To buy apples. – to by apples -- And I know I can do this

49
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:10,511
Regardless of what the market price is, because that was that was the delivery price on the

50
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:14,868
Futures contract. So now I have eight dollars net. Now I

51
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:18,434
Have eight dollars net. And those apples that I’ve just

52
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:22,436
Bought, those thousand pounds of apples, I can then use those apples to

53
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:26,399
Return it to the person that I borrowed the apples from. So they got their apples

54
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:29,975
Back, and they got that one percent on the two hundred dollars over the

55
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,768
Course the year and I made a risk-free eight dollars.

56
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:37,972
So if you think about it once again, this is kind of setting a lower bound on what

57
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:42,025
The actual settlement price on the futures contract is. I should

58
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:45,854
Not be able to make this risk-free profit. If it's available, then people will

59
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:50,315
Do it. And what it'll do, it will increase demand to be

60
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,970
The buyer here. So this price should go up. And it would increase

61
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,556
Supply on the selling side here. And so maybe this price

62
00:03:57,556 --> 00:04:01,000
Over here would go down.
