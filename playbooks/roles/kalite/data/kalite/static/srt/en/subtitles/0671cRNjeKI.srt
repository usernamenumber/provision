1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,460
We are asked which of these
lines are perpendicular.

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,160
And it has to be perpendicular
to one of the other lines, you

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,680
can't be just perpendicular
by yourself.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,970
And perpendicular line, just
so you have a visualization

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,190
for what for perpendicular lines
look like, two lines are

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,930
perpendicular if they intersect
at right angles.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,630
So if this is one line right
there, a perpendicular line

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,850
will look like this.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,640
A perpendicular line will
intersect it, but it won't

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,110
just be any intersection,
it will

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,710
intersect at right angles.

13
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,900
   

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,730
So these two lines are
perpendicular.

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,570
Now, if two lines are
perpendicular, if the slope of

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,330
this orange line is m-- so let's
say its equation is y is

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,440
equal to mx plus, let's say
it's b 1, so it's some

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,000
y-intercept-- then the equation
of this yellow line,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,360
its slope is going to be the
negative inverse of this guy.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,690
This guy right here is going to
be y is equal to negative 1

21
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,950
over mx plus some other
y-intercept.

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,230
Or another way to think about
it is if two lines are

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,550
perpendicular, the product of
their slopes is going to be

24
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,760
negative 1.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,440
And so you could write that
there. m times negative 1 over

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,570
m, that's going to be-- these
two guys are going to cancel

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,380
out-- that's going to be
equal to negative 1.

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,200
So let's figure out the slopes
of each of these lines and

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,090
figure out if any of them are
the negative inverse of any of

30
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,060
the other ones.

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,660
So line A, the slope is pretty
easy to figure out, it's

32
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,850
already in slope-intercept
form, its slope is 3.

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,070
So line A has a slope of 3.

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,970
Line B, it's in standard form,
not too hard to put it in

35
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,920
slope-intercept form, so
let's try to do it.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,950
So let's do line B over here.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,640
Line B, we have x plus 3y
is equal to negative 21.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,630
Let's subtract x from both sides
so that it ends up on

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,500
the right-hand side.

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,000
So we end up with 3y is equal
to negative x minus 21.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,070
And now let's divide both sides
of this equation by 3

42
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:18,850
and we get y is equal to
negative 1/3 x minus 7.

43
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,050
So this character's slope
is negative 1/3.

44
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,660
So here m is equal
to negative 1/3.

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,080
So we already see they
are the negative

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,910
inverse of each other.

47
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,970
You take the inverse of 3, it's
1/3, and then it's the

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,820
negative of that.

49
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,870
Or you take the inverse of
negative 1/3, it's negative 3,

50
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,730
and then this is the
negative of that.

51
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,820
So these two lines are
definitely perpendicular.

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,260
   

53
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,320
Let's see the third
line over here.

54
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,160
So line C is 3x plus
y is equal to 10.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,960
If we subtract 3x from both
sides, we get y is equal to

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,850
negative 3x plus 10.

57
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,480
So our slope in this
case is negative 3.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,490
   

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,020
Now this guy's the negative of
that guy, this guy's slope is

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,560
a negative, but not the negative
inverse, so it's not

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,600
perpendicular.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,370
And this guy is the inverse of
that guy but not the negative

63
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,280
inverse, so this guy is not
perpendicular to either of the

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,390
other two, but line
A and line B are

65
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,170
perpendicular to each other.

66
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,266
