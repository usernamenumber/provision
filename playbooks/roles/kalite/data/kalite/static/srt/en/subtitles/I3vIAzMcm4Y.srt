1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,059
Let's do another example of
solving a nonhomogeneous

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,170
linear differential equation
with a constant coefficient.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,870
And the left-hand side is going
to be the same one that

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,560
we've been doing.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,980
The second derivative of y
minus 3 times the first

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:22,620
derivative minus 4 times y is
equal to-- and now instead of

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,220
having an exponential function
or a trigonometric functional,

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,165
we'll just have a simple--
well, it just looks an x

10
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,000
squared term, but it's
a polynomial.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,590
Right?

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,200
And you know how to solve the
general solution of the

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,170
homogeneous equation
if this were 0.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,440
So we're going to focus just
now on the particular

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,560
solution, then we can later
add that to the general

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,710
solution of a nonhomogeneous
equation, to get the solution.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,410
So what's a good guess for
a particular solution?

18
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,440
Well, when we had exponentials,
we guessed that

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,730
our solution would be
an exponential.

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,200
When we had trigonometric
functions, we guessed that our

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,730
solution would be
trigonomretric.

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,230
So since we have a polynomial
here that makes this

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,290
differential equation
nonhomogeneous, let's guess

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,690
that a particular solution
is a polynomial.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,940
And that makes sense.

26
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,680
   

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,430
If you take a second-degree
polynomial, take its

28
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,620
derivatives and add and
subtract, you should hopefully

29
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,560
get another second-degree
polynomial.

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,650
So let's guess that it is Ax
squared plus Bx plus C.

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,550
And what would be a
second derivative?

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,095
Well a second derivative
would be 2Ax plus B.

33
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:34,350
   

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,030
Sorry, this is the
first derivitive.

35
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,880
The second derivative
would be 2A.

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,490
And now we can substitute back
into the original equation.

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:51,080
We get the second derivitive,
2A minus 3 times the first

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,190
derivitive.

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,270
So minus 3A-- oh no, sorry.

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,290
Minus 3 times this.

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:09,360
So minus 6Ax minus 3B minus 4
times the function itself.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:20,610
So minus 4Ax squared
minus 4Bx minus 4C.

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,350
That's just 4 times
all of that.

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,840
That's going to equal
4x squared.

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,630
   

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,010
And I'll just group our x
squared, our x and our

47
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,230
constant terms, and then we
could try to solve for the

48
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,230
coeficients.

49
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:34,910
So let's see.

50
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,210
I have one x squared
term here.

51
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,305
So it's minus 4Ax squared.

52
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:45,540
   

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
And then what are my x terms?

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,910
I have minus 6Ax minus 4Bx.

55
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:58,750
So then say plus minus
6A minus 4B times x.

56
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,210
I just added the coefficients.

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,380
And then finally we get
our constant terms. 2A

58
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,530
minus 3B minus 4C.

59
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,690
   

60
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,595
And all of that will
equal 4x squared.

61
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:23,180
   

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,510
Now how do we solve
for A, B, and C?

63
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,010
Well, whatever the x squared
coefficients add up on this

64
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,840
side, it should equal 4.

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,590
Whatever the x coefficients add
up on this side, it should

66
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,690
be equal to 0, right?

67
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,340
Because you can view this
as plus 0x, right?

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,750
And then you could say plus
0 constant as well.

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,840
So the constants should
also add up to 0.

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,900
So let's do that.

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,210
So first let's do the
x squared term.

72
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,555
So minus 4A should
be equal to 4.

73
00:03:56,555 --> 00:04:04,090
   

74
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:09,580
And then that tells us that
A is equal to minus 1.

75
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,870
Fair enough.

76
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,980
Now the x terms. Minus
6A, minus 4B, that

77
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,880
should be equal to 0.

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,180
Right?

79
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,930
So let's write that down.

80
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,279
We know what A is, so
let's substitute.

81
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,790
So minus 6 times A, so minus
6 times minus 1.

82
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:35,270
So that's 6 minus 4B
is equal to 0.

83
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,930
So we get 4B-- I'm just putting
4B on this side and

84
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,520
then switching.

85
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,180
4B is equal to 6.

86
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,170
And B is equal to-- 6
divided by 4 is 3/2.

87
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,640
And then finally the constant
term should also equal 0, so

88
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,750
let's solve for those.

89
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,910
2 times A, that's minus 2.

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,500
Minus 3 times B.

91
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,570
Well, that's minus
3 times this.

92
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:10,390
So minus 9/2 minus
4C is equal to 0.

93
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,580
So let's see.

94
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,960
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

95
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:21,320
So this is minus 4
minus 9/2, right?

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,070
That's minus 4/2 minus 9/2-- and
we could take the 4C and

97
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,260
put it on that side--
it's equal to 4C.

98
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,170
   

99
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,390
What's minus 4 minus 9?

100
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,940
That's minus 13/2.

101
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,460
Minus 13/2 is equal to 4C.

102
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,480
4C, divide both sides by 4, and
then you get C is equal to

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,590
minus 13/8.

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,090
And I think I haven't made
a careless mistake.

105
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,050
So if I haven't, then
our particular

106
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,370
solution, we now know.

107
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,340
Well, let me write the
whole solution.

108
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:09,990
So.

109
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,910
And this is a nice stretch of
horizontal real estate.

110
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,490
So let's write our solution.

111
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,890
Our solution is going to be
equal to the particular

112
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,100
solution, which is Ax squared,
so that's minus 1x squared.

113
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,950
   

114
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:35,030
Ax squared plus Bx plus 3/2x
plus C minus 13/8.

115
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,360
So this is the particular
solution.

116
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,670
We solved for A, B, and C.

117
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,520
We determined the undetermined
coefficient.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
And now if we want the general
solution, we add to that the

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,400
general solution of the
homogeneous equation.

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,090
   

121
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,940
What was that? y prime
minus 3y prime minus

122
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,360
4y is equal to 0.

123
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
And we've solved this
multiple times.

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,430
We know that the general
solution to the homogeneous

125
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:08,040
equation is C1e to the 4x plus
C2e to the minus x, right?

126
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
You just take the characteristic
equation r

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,400
squared minus 3r minus 4.

128
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,930
What did you get?

129
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:20,090
You get r minus 4 times r plus
1, and then that's how you get

130
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,940
minus 1 and 4.

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,810
Anyway.

132
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,880
So if this is the general
solution to the homogeneous

133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,350
equation, this a particular
solution to the

134
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,080
nonhomogeneous equation.

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,180
The general solution to the
nonhomogeneous equation is

136
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,150
going to be the sum
of the two.

137
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,500
So let's add that.

138
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:44,200
So plus C1e to the 4x plus
C2e to the minus x.

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,230
So there you.

140
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,720
I don't think that
was too painful.

141
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
The most painful part was just
making sure that you don't

142
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
make a careless mistake
with the algebra.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
But using a fairly
straightforward, really

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,210
algebraic technique, we were
able to get a fairly fancy

145
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,070
solution to this second order
linear nonhomogeneous

146
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,090
differential equation with
constant coefficients.

147
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,360
See you in the next video.

148
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,900
