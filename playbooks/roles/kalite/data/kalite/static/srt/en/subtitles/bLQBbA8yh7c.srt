1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:05,885
One thing I should probably make clear is that this idea of getting a 2 percent management fee and then

2
00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:11,877
participating in the profits at around 20 percent - getting this 20 percent carried interest - this isn't

3
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:17,794
unique to hedge funds. This is actually the same compensation structure that you'll normally have at

4
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:23,810
a venture capital fund or a private equity fund. And just to be clear, venture capital really is a form

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,510
of private equity. But normally, when someone says "private equity" they're not talking about venture

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:37,177
capital in particular. In all of these situations, the managers will get roughly 2 percent on the - for

7
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:41,893
managing the fund they'll get 20 percent of the profits. The only difference, really, in terms of how it's

8
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:47,710
structured - and, a venture capital or a private equity fund will still have kind of a limited partnership

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,079
for the actual fund and then they would have a management company that gets the management fees and the

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,177
profits. The only difference is, because a hedge fund for the most part is probably going to invest in

11
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:03,560
public securities, it can get the money right from the get-go and put that money to work because it

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,628
tends to invest in fairly liquid assets that they can just go out and buy. So a hedge fund will normally

13
00:01:10,628 --> 00:01:16,328
just take as much money as it needs to invest right from the beginning. A venture capital firm or a private

14
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:23,076
equity firm, what they'll to is say, look, "I'm going to raise a 100 million dollar fund, but I'm not

15
00:01:23,076 --> 00:01:27,544
going to be able to just go out the door tomorrow and invest 100 million dollars. In the case of a venture

16
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:33,777
capital firm, they're going to have to look at entrepreneurs and do their due dilligence, same thing for

17
00:01:33,777 --> 00:01:37,627
a private equity firm, they're going to have to look for companies they might want to buy. Private equity,

18
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:43,971
you're talking about more mature companies that maybe this firm thinks it can buy and turn around, maybe

19
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:48,921
some mature companies that need some money to grow really fast. Venture capital tends to be investing in

20
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:58,988
some guys and a business plan, or, maybe these smaller, more risky companies. But in either of these

21
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:02,220
situations they won't find them tomorrow, so what they do is they go to their investors and get their

22
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,487
investors to commit a certain amount of money. To say, commit 100 million dollars, and they'll get the

23
00:02:07,487 --> 00:02:12,953
management fee. They'll get the management fee on what those investors commit, but they won't take the

24
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:16,821
money right then and there. They'll take the money as they need it - they'll do what's called a "capital

25
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:23,338
call" to their investors, saying, "Hey, I just found a good 5 million dollar investment, I now need this

26
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:28,570
percentage of what you committed to so I can go out and make this investment in the hedge fund," that's

27
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,137
not the case, all of it is up front. But it really is the same compensation scheme. And that's why if

28
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:40,570
you go to any fancy business school, you'll find that these are kind of the careers that, at least people

29
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,453
who are interested in...well, I don't want to give them any kind of characteristics...there's a bunch

30
00:02:47,453 --> 99:59:59,999
of reasons why people would want to go into these, but these are definitely sought-after careers at a lot of fancy business schools
