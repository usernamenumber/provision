1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,930
It's always good to see the same problem done more than one

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,420
way, and it's especially true with these ratio problems

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,340
because they, in general, can be done in many, many different

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,800
ways, and different types of ways gel with different people.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,890
So I just did a video on this where I said that the

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,710
ratio of apples to oranges starts off at five to eight.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,560
And we take away fifteen.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,860
We take away fifteen apples, and the ratio becomes one to four.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,210
And then the question that we have to answer is how much

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,050
total fruit do we have after taking away the fifteen apples?

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,850
And we figured it out.

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,980
We figured out that it's fifty pieces of fruit.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,490
But let's see if we can do it a different way.

14
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,950
The last time I kind of talked through it and

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,780
used a lot of words.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,600
Let see if we can do it a little bit more algebraically.

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:54,880
So let a is equal to the number of apples we are starting with,

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,390
and let o equal the number of oranges.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,350
That doesn't change throughout the whole problem.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,170
So we're starting off with a apples and o oranges.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,460
So the ratio of a to o is equal to what?

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,140
The ratio of a-- let me actually-- well, instead of

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,080
trying to fit this whole problem into this part of the

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,640
screen, let me just copy and paste this part, and do it at

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,720
the bottom part of the screen.

26
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,700
Let me copy it, and then let me scroll down here where I have

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,370
some extra real estate because I think I'm going to need more

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,010
than that little pocket of area right there.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,470
So I copied and pasted just like that.

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,910
OK, so there we have it.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,370
a is the number of apples to start with, and o is

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,480
the number of oranges.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,920
So we could write-- let me do it in a color that

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,890
I haven't used before.

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,410
I actually haven't used white.

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,950
So we can say that the ratio of apples to oranges

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,170
is equal to five to eight.

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,680
That's what they tell us, that the number of apples we start

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,360
with divided by the number of oranges, or the ratio of them--

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,260
i have to be a little bit more particular-- is five to eight.

41
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,400
Then we removed fifteen apples.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,880
So if we remove fifteen apples, how many apples do we have?

43
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,280
We have a minus fifteen apples.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,520
And they tell us that the ratio-- then the ratio of

45
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,620
apples to oranges becomes one to four.

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,530
So a minus fifteen, which is the number of apples we start with

47
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,670
minus fifteen, the ratio of that to oranges is equal to one over four.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,960
And let's see if we can solve these two equations.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,040
I have two equations here, and I have two unknowns.

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,120
Let's see what we can do here.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,870
And I should probably shouldn't have labeled-- there's a reason

52
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,360
why o isn't used in algebra a lot, because it looks just

53
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,720
like a zero, but I'll try to be careful.

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,430
So this first-- let me write down my two

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,490
equations over here.

56
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,750
It never hurts to rewrite it.

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,240
The original apples to oranges ratio is five to eight.

58
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,720
Then when we remove fifteen apples, the ratio of our new number of

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,960
apples to oranges is equal to one over four.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,050
This is just an algebraic way of stating our problem.

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,610
Let's see if we can solve this.

62
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,220
If we cross-multiply both sides of this equation,

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,600
we get eighta is equal to fiveo.

64
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,660
That's not a zero.

65
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,410
It's equal to fiveo.

66
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,470
Or if we subtract fiveo from both sides, get eighta

67
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,590
minus fiveo is equal to zero.

68
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,580
So this is just a linear equation with two unknowns.

69
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,290
Now, what do we get on this right-hand side?

70
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,490
If we cross-multiply, we get foura minus sixty.

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,710
I'm just multiplying four times a minus fifteen.

72
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,990
That is equal to one times o, or we could just write--

73
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,590
well, I'll write oneo.

74
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,300
That's not a ten.

75
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,980
That's oneo, or one orange.

76
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,110
And if we rearrange this, if we subtract the oneo from both

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,460
sides, we get foura minus oneo minus sixty is equal to zero.

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,550
Or if we add sixty to both sides, we get foura minus

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,310
oneo is equal to sixty.

80
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,560
And here, you might recognize that these are just two

81
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,870
linear equations right here.

82
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,820
That's one of them, and that's the second of them.

83
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,240
And I have two unknowns.

84
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,620
I have a and o.

85
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,290
I probably should have called them x and y to prevent this o

86
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,530
from looking so confusing because that's a zero

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,250
and that's an o.

88
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,870
But I think you get what I'm saying.

89
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,590
So how do we solve this?

90
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,380
Well, what we can do is we can multiply one of these times a

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,500
convenient factor, and then add them or subtract them to

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,380
get rid of one of the two variables, so let's do that.

93
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,010
Let's multiply this equation times minus two, so it becomes

94
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,510
minus eighta plus twoo is equal to minus one hundred and twenty.

95
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,990
I just multiplied this equation right here times minus two.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,210
If I do that and then if I add it to this equation right here,

97
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:59,910
this equation is eighta minus fiveo is equal to zero, what do I get?

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,290
Let's just add these two equations.

99
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,120
This becomes zeroa.

100
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,510
Minus five plus two is minus threeo is equal to minus one hundred and twenty, or o is

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,030
equal to-- you divide both sides-- you can ignore this.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,190
You divide both sides by minus three, you get o is equal to forty.

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,880
So let's see.

104
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,100
So the oranges is equal to forty.

105
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,560
And that's before and after.

106
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,940
The o never changes.

107
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,990
o is equal to forty.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,860
So what are our apples equal to?

109
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,380
We could go to either of these equations.

110
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,140
We could go to any of these that we have.

111
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,250
Maybe we can go to this one.

112
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,260
So we have eight times our number of apples is equal to five times

113
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,540
the number of oranges, or five times forty.

114
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,430
eight times the number of apples is equal to two hundred, or the apples is

115
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,790
equal to two hundred over eight, which is equal to one hundred over four,

116
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,380
which is equal to twenty-five.

117
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,980
So remember what a and o are.

118
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,310
O is the number of oranges we have throughout the problem.

119
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,920
a is the number of apples we start with.

120
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,180
That's what we start with.

121
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,790
So you can say that we start with twenty-five apples, forty oranges,

122
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:25,370
or we start with sixty-five pieces of fruit.

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,470
Then if you remove fifteen fruit, you'll end up with fifty fruit,

124
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,740
which is the exact same answer we got the other way of doing

125
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,410
this problem, and it's nice to see it done two ways.

126
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,690
If you want to know the number of apples we end up with,

127
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,990
we started with twenty-five apples.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,040
If you were to take fifteen away from them, you're going

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,320
to get ten apples.

130
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,060
So you start with twenty-five apples, forty oranges, sixty-five fruit.

131
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,240
You end with ten apples, forty oranges, or fifty fruit.

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,990
Either way.

133
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,730
Hopefully, it was reasonably useful to see this

134
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,820
done another way.
