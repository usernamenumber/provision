1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:05,399
We're given a bunch of lines here that intersect in all different ways and form triangles.

2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,750
And what I want to do in this video,

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,849
We've been given the measures of some of the angles.

4
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:10,866
This angle.

5
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:11,366
That angle

6
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,549
And that angle.

7
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,365
And what we want to do in this video is figure out what the measure of this angle is.

8
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,549
And we're going to call that measure "X".

9
00:00:18,549 --> 00:00:22,949
And so I encourage you to pause the video right now and try it yourself.

10
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:25,300
And then I'm going to give you the solution.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,382
So I'm assuming you've unpaused it and you've solved it or you've given at least a good shot of it.

12
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:30,516
So let's try to do it.

13
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:32,681
What's fun about these is there's multiple ways to solve these.

14
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:35,432
And you kind of just have to keep figuring out what you can figure out.

15
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:38,808
So let's say you start on the left-hand side right over here.

16
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:48,283
If this is 121 degrees, then this angle right over here is supplementary to this angle right over there.

17
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:57,215
So this is 121 degrees, 121 degrees plus this green angle has to be equal to 180 degrees.

18
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:04,383
So this is going to be 180 minus 121. Let's see, that's the same thing as 80 minus 21.

19
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:08,050
80 minus 20 would be 60. So that's going to be 59 degrees.

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,981
So let me write that down. 59 degrees.

21
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:16,149
Now we see that we have two angles of a triangle.

22
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,399
If you have two angles of a triangle, you can figure out the third angle

23
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,932
because they need to add up to 180.

24
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:25,955
Or you can say that this angle right over here, so we'll call that "Question Mark,"

25
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:33,865
We know that 59 plus 29 plus "Question Mark" needs to be equal to 180 degrees.

26
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:36,736
And if we subtract the 59 and the 29 from both sides we get

27
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:43,629
"Question Mark" is equal to 180 minus 59 minus 29 degrees.

28
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:53,641
So that is going to be 180 minus 59 minus 29. Let's see 180 minus 59 we already know is 121.

29
00:01:53,641 --> 00:02:04,000
And then 121 minus 29. If you subtract just 20, you get 101. If you subtract another 9, you get 92.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,501
So that's going to be equal to 92 degrees.

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:13,773
We'll this right here is equal to 92 degrees, and this angle right here is vertical with that angle.

32
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:17,717
So it is also going to be equal to 92 degrees.

33
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:21,716
And now we're getting pretty close; we can zoom in on this triangle down here.

34
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:26,949
Let me save some space here. So let me just say that that over there is also going to be 92 degrees.

35
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:32,850
And at this triangle down here, we have two of the sides of the triangle. We just have to figure out the third.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,782
And actually we don't have to do much math here because we one side-

37
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,782
Sorry.

38
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:41,782
We have two of the <i>angles</i> of this triangle. We have to figure out the third angle.

39
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:48,750
So over here we have one angle that's 92, one angle is 29, the other one will be 180 minus 92 minus 29.

40
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,816
And we don't even have to do any math here because

41
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:54,766
essentially it's the exact same angles as this triangle right over here.

42
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:59,882
We have a 92 degree angle, we have a 29 degree angle and the other one is 59 degrees.

43
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:05,681
So in this case it has to be also 59 degrees because over here they added up to 180.

44
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:07,599
So over here they'll also add up to 180.

45
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,732
So that will also get us to 59 degrees.

46
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,349
We could've just get that by taking 180 and subtracting 29 and subtracting 92.

47
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:22,566
And then if this is 59 degrees, then this angle is also going to be 59 degrees because they are vertical angles.

48
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:27,483
So we're done. X is equal to 59 degrees.

49
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:31,433
Now, there's multiple ways you could have reasoned through this problem.

50
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:36,715
You could have immediately said... So let me start over actually.

51
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:40,566
Maybe a faster way, but you wouldn't have been able to do those basic steps there...

52
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:48,899
This is an exterior angle right over here. It is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles.

53
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:53,215
So 121 is going to be 29 plus this thing right over here.

54
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,266
And we ended up doing that when I did it step-by-step before,

55
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:03,132
but here we're just using a few things we know about triangles ahead of time to maybe skip a step or two.

56
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:07,382
Although I like to do it the other way to make sure we don't do anything weird.

57
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:13,866
So anyway, this is going to be 121 minus 29, which is going to be 92.

58
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,699
And if this is 92, then this is also going to be 92.

59
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,949
And then, if this is X, then this is also going to be X.

60
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:27,816
And X plus 92 plus 29 is equal to 180 degrees.

61
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:35,532
And X plus 92 plus 29 is going to be 121 degrees. We already knew that before.

62
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:41,250
And so that is going to equal 180 degrees.

63
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,982
So X is equal to 59 degrees.

64
00:04:47,982 --> 99:59:59,999
So there is a ton of ways that you could've thought about this problem.
