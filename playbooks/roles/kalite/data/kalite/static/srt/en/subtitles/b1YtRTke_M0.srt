00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,250
In this video we're gonna look an introduction to molecular orbital theory.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,082
Now, MO theory involves some very complicated quantum math

3
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:11,413
and I'm going to completely ignore the math and we're just going to try to think about it

4
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:14,168
as simply as possible to see it in pictures.

5
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:17,603
So, when we did mechanisms,
we thought about electrons as being particles

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:20,479
but we can also think about them as being waves,

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:25,746
and we know that electrons are found in highest probability in what we call atomic orbitals.

8
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:30,336
When atoms combine to form molecules, those atomic orbitals actually recombine

9
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:37,410
to form what we call molecular orbitals. Combining atomic orbitals together is just like combining waves together, and

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,012
so we're going to start off with a very simple way of thinking about waves.

11
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:44,543
We could even think about waves like waves in the ocean.

12
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:50,667
So thinking of these horizontal lines as being the average level of my ocean

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:53,001
i can go ahead and draw a wave there.

14
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,944
And so i have part of the wave above the average level of the ocean

15
00:00:56,944 --> 00:01:02,335
i'm going to call that a fase and i'm going to make that a red face like that

16
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:05,334
and then part of the wave is below the average level of the ocean

17
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,478
so i'm going to make that the blue fase.

18
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:10,334
So there's one wave. If i were to combine that wave

19
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:12,811
with another wave that looks exactly the same

20
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:16,418
so let's pretend that these two waves are identical

21
00:01:16,418 --> 00:01:21,876
this part would be red, and this would be blue

22
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:25,185
if i were to combine these two waves there's a couple of ways to do it:

23
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,411
you can think of superimposing these two waves on top of each other

24
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:31,814
and one way to think about that would be to think about vectors

25
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:35,190
so if i thought about a vector in here, for the top wave,

26
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,600
-if you've taken a physics class you'll understand everything there is to know about vectors-

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,173
so here's one vector, and then this vector down here would be going in the same direction,

28
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:46,939
with the same length. If i were to superimpose these two waves on top of each other,

29
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:55,666
these two vectors would add to each other, so we would get another bigger wave here on the right.

30
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:59,333
So, these two vectors are going to add together like that.

31
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,334
The same thing happens with the fases in blue

32
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,375
This vector would be pointing down this time

33
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,839
this would also be pointing down, but if you add up these two waves together

34
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,286
if you superimpose them on top of each other

35
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,860
these two vectors would add like that, and

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,250
you would get an even bigger part over here like that.

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,615
So that would be the product of adding those two waves together

38
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,279
they add constructively

39
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:27,746
so over here these would be our two red fases added together

40
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:30,667
and this would be where our blue fases are added together.

41
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,278
So we get constructive overlaps.

42
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:39,333
I'll write that: "CONSTRUCTIVE OVERLAP".

43
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:45,956
And so, this is when we added our waves in fase, combined these two waves in fase

44
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,811
which means that their colours matched up

45
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:52,167
we combined the two red colours together, and we combined the two blue fases together

46
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,412
and that gave us constructive overlap.

47
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,944
Let's do another example of adding waves, another very simple one:

48
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:05,745
So we're going to start again with a wave that has parts above the average level of the ocean

49
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:09,584
and then this part is going to be below

50
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:12,482
This time, though, we're going to add something that is the opposite

51
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:18,023
So we're going to start below the average level and we'll finish above. Like that.

52
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:21,275
Let me go ahead and make this one blue now

53
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:24,618
and then this one red over here

54
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,281
and so we're going to add these two waves.

55
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,953
Once again, vectors help me think about it

56
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,208
and so if i think about this first wave

57
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,875
this vector would be going up

58
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:39,150
and for the second wave the vector would go in the opposite direction

59
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,267
So when i add these 2 vectors together

60
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,040
when i superimpose these 2 waves

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
the vectors would cancel each other

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,666
and you would get destructive overlap.

63
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,249
So you would get nothing over here on the right

64
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:53,092
this would be DESTRUCTIVE OVERLAP

65
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:55,424
those two vectors cancelled each other out

66
00:03:55,424 --> 00:04:01,610
and the exact same thing happens when you try to combine this part of the wave

67
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,585
with this part of the wave, these 2 vectors would cancel each other out in space

68
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,811
we get destructive overlap

69
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:13,542
We tried to combine these two waves OUT OF FASE

70
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:16,229
meaning we tried to combine the red with the blue both times, and so

71
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,551
since we're combining out of fase, the vectors cancel and give us destructive overlap.

72
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,817
So, this is a very simple way of thinking about waves

73
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:26,746
the nice thing about it is that when we combine atomic orbitals

74
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,545
we can think about the same thing.

75
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:33,000
We can combine atomic orbitals either "in fase" or "out of fase".

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,744
Let's go ahead and do that. Let's combine some atomic orbitals and

77
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:41,076
we're going to do so for the simplest atom, which is hydrogen.

78
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:45,410
So, if i take hydrogen with its one valence electron

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,816
i know that this electron occupies an atomic orbital

80
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:53,167
that shapes like a sphere.

81
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:58,548
So if i were to draw that spherically-shaped atomic orbital

82
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,966
I know that hydrogen has a nucleus

83
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:05,002
and i know the most common isotope has only one proton in the nucleus (N.T.: all hydrogen isotopes have only one proton)

84
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:07,337
so that's going to represent the nucleus of hydrogen

85
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:11,081
and then the sphere around it is the atomic orbital of hydrogen, like that.

86
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:15,002
So i'm going to combine that H atom with another H atom, so once again

87
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:19,503
i'm going to think about a nucleus for the H atom

88
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:25,079
and then one valence electron occupies an s-orbital which is shaped like a sphere.

89
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,925
All right, let's go ahead and draw this again down here

90
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:35,078
so i'm going to have the nucleus, and i'm going to have the s-orbital

91
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:38,917
and the same thing over here, like that.

92
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:43,743
Now, when i combine my two atomic orbitals together,

93
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:58,528
i know that i can combine them "in fase" and "out of fase".

94
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,610
Let's put some colors on here.

95
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,333
If i'm going to combine the first two atomic orbitals in fase, i need to make them the same color

96
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:09,667
so i'm going to make these guys red

97
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:14,143
and then down here, i'm going to combine out of fase, so i'm going to use different colors

98
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:19,684
this is going to be red, and this is going to be blue. Like that.

99
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:25,233
Ok. So i know when i combine two waves in fase i got constructive overlap

100
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:31,414
and so when i combine my two atomic orbitals for hydrogen in fase

101
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:37,881
i'm going to have constructing overlap. So let's draw the molecular orbital that is produced.

102
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,334
Here's one nucleus, and here's another nucleus.

103
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:45,444
These two atomic orbitals are going to recombine, cease to exist,

104
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:48,834
they're going to produce a molecular orbital

105
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,077
an orbital associated with the entire hydrogen molecule

106
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:56,788
so here i have sketched in my molecular orbital on the right

107
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:02,164
These combined in fase, it was constructive overlap, and this is the molecular orbital that results.

108
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:08,278
The atomic orbitals have ceased to exist, they have produced a molecular orbital like that.

109
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:12,001
If i were to draw the dot structure of what's happened

110
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:19,877
you can think that these electrons have been shared to produce a covalent bond

111
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:23,278
between these two H atoms, like that.

112
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:27,412
And so, this is the molecular orbital that is produced as a result of constructive overlap

113
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:31,584
Again, the atomic atoms cease to exist to produce a molecular orbital.

114
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:38,050
And this is a bonding molecular orbital.

115
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:43,153
We know that because the electrons are shared between the two nucleae.

116
00:07:43,153 --> 00:07:50,478
The delocalization, the sharing of these electrons, lowers the energy of the hydrogen molecule.

117
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:56,078
A bonding molecular orbital is lower in energy, it's constructively overlapped.

118
00:07:56,078 --> 00:08:02,875
If you look down here, we try to combine our 2 atomic s-orbitals out of fase

119
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,583
when we try to do that, we get destructive overlap.

120
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:13,145
There is no sharing of electrons between our two nucleae

121
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:17,127
and so we produce what's called a nodal plane between the two nucleae.

122
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:22,747
There's no electron density between the two nucleae, so if i were to draw my molecular orbitals

123
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:27,064
like these, is what you see in most textbooks

124
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:33,686
so this is our red fase, and on the right is the blue fase.

125
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:40,583
So, when you try to combine atomic orbitals out of fase, you produce a molecular orbital

126
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:44,542
but there's no electron density between these two nucleae,

127
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,655
so really there's no bond,

128
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:59,274
and so we call this an anti-bonding molecular orbital.

129
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:03,641
So, destructive overlap means there's no electron density between the two nucleae

130
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:08,149
therefore, those two positive charges are exposed to each other

131
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:13,190
and we know like-charges repel, it's like trying to put two magnets together

132
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,259
on the same pole, they're going to repel

133
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,145
it would take a lot of energy to hold those positive charges together

134
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:23,147
so i like to think about the fact that an anti-bonding molecular orbital

135
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:26,843
is much higher in energy than a bonding molecular orbital.

136
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:32,046
[and repeats the same concept once again]

137
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:36,631
What we see here is: when you combine two atomic orbitals together

138
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:43,149
you produce one bonding molecular orbital and one anti-bonding molecular orbital

139
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,746
so, two atomic orbitals combine to form a total of two molecular orbitals.

140
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:50,814
The bonding molecular orbital is lower in energy.

141
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:54,749
The anti-bonding molecular orbital is higher in energy.

142
00:09:54,749 --> 00:10:02,477
We could represent that on an energy diagram.

143
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:08,078
So, here's energy.

144
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,536
This energy level represents our atomic orbitals.

145
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:16,205
So there's one hydrogen atom with one electron

146
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:18,550
and there's another hydrogen atom with another electron

147
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:33,897
and when those two atomic orbitals combine they form two molecular orbitals

148
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:41,058
The one that's lower in energy, is our bonding molecular orbital.

149
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:51,358
And the one that's higher in energy, is our anti-bonding molecular orbital.

150
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:58,478
So when these two electrons from our atomic orbitals combine,

151
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:03,413
they're going to fill the bonding molecular orbital since is lower in energy

152
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,745
this is analogous to electron configurations,

153
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:10,409
electrons are going to fill the lowest energy orbital available

154
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:14,883
and [?] is going to pair up the spins.

155
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:20,773
So these two electrons in the hydrogen atom prefer to occupy the bonding molecular orbital

156
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,742
because it's lower in energy.

157
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:27,487
So, the anti-bonding molecular orbital does not have any electrons for this example

158
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:34,250
Of course, it is possible to give an electron in a bonding molecular orbital

159
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,480
enough energy where it could jump above to the anti-bonding molecular orbital

160
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,547
and that would break the bond between the two hydrogen atoms here.

161
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:50,772
So, hopefully, this video is a nice introduction to the concept of molecular orbital theory

162
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:54,772
we're going to use this concept a few more times to develop more complicated topics of organic chemistry.
