1
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:07,141
We're in Florence and we're standing outside of the Duomo -

2
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,896
The cathedral of Florence -

3
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:12,147
And we're looking up at Brunelleschi's dome.

4
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:15,311
- It's huge. Until St. Peter's it was the highest dome that had ever been raised.

5
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:18,977
And in its width it was as wide as the Pantheon.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:19,869
- Almost.

7
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,481
- If you think about the Duomo itself. It had been planned in the 14th Century.

8
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:31,151
- The plan was to build a dome that had a span nearly equal to that of the Pantheon.

9
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,973
- And of course the Pantheon had been built in the ancient world,

10
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:36,644
And that technology had largely been lost.

11
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:42,738
- Right. So first and foremost, what Brunelleschi did was an amazing engineering achievement.

12
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:49,114
The challenge was - how to build a dome this wide without wooden centering.

13
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:53,066
Generally, when you built an archway, and a dome is really just an arch -

14
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:54,555
- in the round -

15
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,963
- you put up a wooden framework.

16
00:00:56,963 --> 00:01:01,817
- So this is the wood to actually support the dome until it can be locked in place by the keystone.

17
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:06,042
- Exactly. So you don't even really need mortar to hold it together because you've got the keystone.

18
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:09,448
- The problem is, this was so big, they couldn't actually get enough lumber,

19
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:13,506
And lumber that was strong enough, to hold the thing up until they could lock it in place.

20
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,485
- So there was no way to do wooden scaffolding or centering to hold it up as it was being built.

21
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:22,620
So how do you build this dome that inclines inward,

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,457
And not have it fall down?

23
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,250
- There's two problems. You've got that issue,

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,199
And then you've got the problem of it wanting to splay outward.

25
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:34,762
- A dome exerts pressure not only down but down and out,

26
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:43,485
And so, one of the biggest challenges is how to raise the dome and deal with that downward and outward pressure

27
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,895
Not cracking the walls underneath.

28
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:48,609
- Now, in the Asian world, for the Pantheon, for example,

29
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,645
They had dealt with that by just creating sheer bulk.

30
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,226
In other words, the walls got to be ten feet thick.

31
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:57,645
- I think actually in the Pantheon thety're something like twenty feet thick of concrete.

32
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,881
- But Brunelleschi couldn't do that here.

33
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:04,647
So what he's done instead is - first of all, he made the decision to make the dome

34
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:06,265
As light as possible.

35
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:08,292
And that means that it's basically hollow.

36
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:10,011
It's a double shell.

37
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,610
And within the shell is a staircase that snakes around,

38
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,215
That allows one actually to get to the top.

39
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:17,948
And if you look, you can see people just below the lantern up at the top of the dome

40
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,615
Taking in the view of the city.

41
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:21,622
- He also created ribs,

42
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:23,408
- For doing a lot of the weight bearing,

43
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:27,645
- And then in between each of the major ribs, which are visible on the outside,

44
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:30,619
There are two within that we can't see.

45
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,051
- And those are actually locked in place by a series of horizontals as well.

46
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:38,365
So there's this whole skeletal structure that's actually holding this piece together.

47
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:44,531
I think most importantly he was able to develop a system where, as the dome was being raised up,

48
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,605
As each course of stone and brick was added,

49
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,900
It was actually locking itself in place.

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,729
And so it was self-sustaining.

51
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:55,514
- Another way that Brunelleschi dealt with the downward and outward thrust

52
00:02:55,514 --> 00:03:01,514
Was to bring chains inside the dome made out of stone and wood,

53
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,958
Locked together with iron, like a girdle,

54
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:09,157
To hold the dome in and to counter that downward and outward thrust.

55
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:13,790
- You might think of an old-fashjioned wooden barrel that has a couple of iron rings around it

56
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,650
To help keep the wood together.

57
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,734
Brunelleschi created cantilevered scaffolding -

58
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,646
- that could rise as the building went up -

59
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:22,708
- and so the workmen had a place to work.

60
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:29,485
Brunelleschi also built new kinds of pulleys and hoists to bring up his heavy massive

61
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:32,379
Pieces of stone to the top of the dome.

62
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,447
So he created this ox hoist - it's just these remarkable machines

63
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,425
That no one had ever seen before.

64
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:43,288
- He actually even designed a special barge to go down the Arno

65
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,731
To be able to bring the materials to the city itself.

66
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:49,828
If you think about the sheer quantity of material that had to be imported and had to be hoisted up,

67
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,612
And had to be put in place,

68
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:53,898
And it's just this remarkable project.

69
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:59,202
- Bricks that had to be created, stone that had to be quarried and brought here,

70
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:01,348
Platforms for the workmen to work on,

71
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,843
Machines to hoist everything,

72
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,346
And I think it was Alberti who said something like -

73
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,756
What Brunelleschi did, he did -

74
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:09,796
- without precedent -

75
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:12,318
- without having any example to lean on.

76
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,644
- utter invention.

77
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,812
Now we think that Brunelleschi may have gone to Rome

78
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:19,563
And may have studied ancient architecture as well as sculpture there,

79
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:24,095
But there's no precedent in the ancient world, even, for what Brunelleschi accomplished here.

80
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:28,731
- Now it's important to say that the dome is not hemispherical, like the dome on the Pantheon.

81
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,210
- it's actually kind of tall.

82
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,146
- Right, it's kind of pointed. In a way it has more of a Gothic shape than a classical shape,

83
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:39,113
But in that way it matches the Gothic church itself.

84
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:44,124
If you look closely you can see these isidre or blind tribunes

85
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:48,064
That Brunelleschi added around the outside of the dome.

86
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:52,421
They actually look very classical compared to the Gothic church.

87
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,094
They in fact look like Roman triumphal arches.

88
00:04:55,094 --> 00:05:00,275
So there's this curious classical moment here in an otherwise very Gothic church.

89
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:04,063
- And it's a church that is not only Gothic but really referring back

90
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:08,229
To the Tuscan Romanesque tradition, especially in terms of the polychromy,

91
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,648
The colored marbles, which Brunelleschi also carries up into the barrel

92
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,713
Just below the dome itself.

93
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,726
But ultimately you've got Brunelleschi who, through his engineering genius,

94
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:22,728
Is solving a problem that Western tradition had never been capable of solving before,

95
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,596
How does one span this enormous space,

96
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:31,170
And in order to do it he's surpassing the ancients that he's even here paying reverence to.
