1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,800
Perhaps even more interesting
than finding the inverse of a

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,210
matrix is trying to determine
when an inverse of a matrix

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,950
doesn't exist. Or when
it's undefined.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,865
And a square matrix for which
there is no inverse, of which

6
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,340
an inverse is undefined is
called a singular matrix.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,970
So let's think about what a
singular matrix will look

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,440
like, and how that applies to
the different problems that

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,140
we've address using matrices.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,410
So if I had the other 2
by 2, because that's

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,420
just a simpler example.

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,470
But it carries over into really
any size square matrix.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,530
So let's take our
2 by 2 matrix.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,320
And the elements are
a, b, c and d.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,220
What's the inverse
of that matrix?

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,510
This hopefully is a bit of
second nature to you now.

17
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:51,765
It's 1 over the determinant of
a, times the adjoint of a.

18
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:53,780
And in this case, you just
switch these two terms. So you

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,200
have a d and an a.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,480
And you make these two
terms negative.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,710
So you have minus
c and minus b.

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,420
So my question to you is, what
will make this entire

23
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,410
expression undefined?

24
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,260
Well it doesn't matter what
numbers I have. If I have

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,740
numbers here that make a
defined, then I can obviously

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,470
swap them or make them negative,
and it won't change

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,030
this part of the expression.

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,130
But what would create a problem
is if we attempted to

29
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,410
divide by 0 here.

30
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,100
If the determinant of the
matrix A were undefined.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:40,560
So A inverse is undefined, if
and only if-- and in math they

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,770
sometimes write it if with two
f's-- if and only if the

33
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,460
determinant of A
is equal to 0.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,910
So the other way to view that
is, if a determinant of any

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,720
matrix is equal to 0, then
that matrix is a singular

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,480
matrix, and it has no inverse,
or the inverse is undefined.

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,950
So let's think about in
conceptual terms, at least the

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,200
two problems that we've looked
at, what a 0 determinant

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,500
means, and see if we can get a
little bit of intuition for

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,580
why there is no inverse.

41
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,830
So what is a 0 determinant?

42
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,850
In this case, what's a
determinant of this 2 by 2?

43
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,170
Well the determinant of
A is equal to what?

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,900
It's equal to ad minus bc.

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,560
   

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,360
So this matrix is singular, or
it has no inverse, if this

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
expression is equal to 0.

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,990
So let me write that
over here.

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:40,380
So if ad is equal to bc-- or we
can just manipulate things,

50
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,350
and we could say if a/b is equal
to c/d-- I just divided

51
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,230
both sides by b, and divided
both sides by d-- so if the

52
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,200
ratio of a:b is the same as the
ratio of c:d, then this

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,010
will have no inverse.

54
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,230
Or another way we could write
this expression, if a/c-- if I

55
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,310
divide both sides by c, and
divide both sides by d-- is

56
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,600
equal to b/d.

57
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,360
So another way that this would
be singular is if-- and it's

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,290
actually the same way.

59
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,570
If this is true, then
this is true.

60
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,630
These are the same.

61
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,150
Just a little bit of algebraic
manipulation.

62
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,690
But if the ratio of a:c is equal
to the ratio of b:d, and

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,270
you can think about why
that's the same thing.

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,900
The ratio of a:b being
the same thing as

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,610
the ratio of c:d.

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,200
But anyway, I don't want
to confuse you.

67
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,180
But let's think about how that
translates into some of the

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,350
problems that we looked at.

69
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,900
So let's say that we wanted to
look at the problem-- Let's

70
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,110
say that we had this matrix
representing the linear

71
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,920
equation problem.

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, actually, this would
be either one.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:01,290
So I have a, b, c, d times x,
y Is equal to two other

74
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,530
numbers that we haven't
used yet, e and f.

75
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,850
So if we have this matrix
equation representing the

76
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,830
linear equation problem, then
the linear equation problem

77
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:23,360
would be translated a times x
plus b times y is equal to e.

78
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,290
And c times x plus d times
y is equal to f.

79
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,690
And we would want to see where
these two intersect.

80
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,950
That would be the solution,
the vector

81
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,150
solution to this equation.

82
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,850
And so, just to get a visual
understanding of what these

83
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,850
two lines look like, let's
put it into the

84
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,200
slope y-intercept form.

85
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,930
So this would become what?

86
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,190
In this case, y is
equal to what?

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:04,610
y is equal to minus
a/b, x plus e/b.

88
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,620
I'm just skipping some steps.

89
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,630
But you subtract ax
from both sides.

90
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,580
And then divide both sides
by b, and you get that.

91
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,365
And then this equation, if you
put it in the same form, just

92
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:15,690
solve for y.

93
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:35,930
You get y is equal to minus
c/d x plus f/y.

94
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,120
So let's think about this.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,720
I should probably change colors
because it looks too--

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,910
Let's think about what these two
equations would look like

97
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,160
if this holds.

98
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,730
   

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,580
And we said if this holds, then
we have no determinant,

100
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,260
and this becomes a singular
matrix, and it has no inverse.

101
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,990
And since it has no inverse, you
can't solve this equation

102
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,110
by multiplying both sides by
the inverse, because the

103
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,430
inverse doesn't exist.

104
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,560
So let's think about this.

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,410
If this is true, we have no
determinant, but what does

106
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,200
that mean intuitively in terms
of these equations?

107
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,540
Well if a/b is equal to c/d,
these two lines will have the

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,380
same slope.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,670
They'll have the same slope.

110
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,150
So if these two expressions are
different, then what do we

111
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,400
know about them?

112
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,380
If two lines that have the
same slope and different

113
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,450
y-intercepts, they're parallel
to each other, and they will

114
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,170
never, ever intersect.

115
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:46,000
So let me draw that, just so you
get the-- this top line--

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,690
They don't have to be positive
numbers, but since this has a

117
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,130
negative, I'll draw it
as a negative slope.

118
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,740
So that's the first line.

119
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,310
And its y-intercept
will be e/b.

120
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,830
   

121
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,960
That's this line right here.

122
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,970
And then the second line-- let
me do it in another color-- I

123
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,800
don't know if it's going to be
above or below that line, but

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,610
it's going to be parallel.

125
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,910
It'll look something
like this.

126
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,750
   

127
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,520
And that line's y-intercept--
so that's this line-- that

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,570
line's y intercept is
going to be f/y.

129
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,370
So if e/b and f/y are different
terms, but both

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,290
lines have the same equation,
they're going to be parallel

131
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,280
and they'll never intersect.

132
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,780
So there actually would
be no solution.

133
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,800
If someone told you-- just the
traditional way that you've

134
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,730
done it, either through
substitution, or through

135
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,920
adding or subtracting the
linear equations-- you

136
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,450
wouldn't be able to find a
solution where these two

137
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,470
intersect, if a/b
is equal to c/d.

138
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,040
So one way to view the singular
matrix is that you

139
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,140
have parallel lines.

140
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,610
Well then you might say, hey
Sal, but these two lines would

141
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,490
intersect if e/b equaled f/y.

142
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,800
If this and this were the
same, then these would

143
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,510
actually be the identical
lines.

144
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,730
And not only would they
intersect, they would

145
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,060
intersect in an infinite
number of places.

146
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,550
But still you would have
no unique solution.

147
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,260
You'd have no one solution
to this equation.

148
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,320
It would be true at all
values of x and y.

149
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,290
So you can kind of view it when
you apply the matrices to

150
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,970
this problem.

151
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,780
The matrix is singular, if the
two lines that are being

152
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,960
represented are either parallel,
or they are the

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,230
exact same line.

154
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,559
They're parallel and not
intersecting at all.

155
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,450
Or they are the exact same line,
and they intersect at an

156
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,880
infinite number of points.

157
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,159
And so it kind of makes
sense that the A

158
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,039
inverse wasn't defined.

159
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,610
So let's think about this in
the context of the linear

160
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,070
combinations of vectors.

161
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,970
That's not what I wanted
to use to erase it.

162
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,250
   

163
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,970
So when we think of this problem
in terms of linear

164
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,220
combination of factors, we can
think of it like this.

165
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:15,010
That this is the same thing as
the vector ac times x plus the

166
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:25,500
vector bd times y, is equal
to the vector ef.

167
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,180
So let's think about
it a little bit.

168
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,110
We're saying, is there some
combination of the vector ac

169
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,510
and the vector bd that
equals the vector ef.

170
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:39,440
But we just said that if we have
no inverse here, we know

171
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,890
that because the determinant
is 0.

172
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,400
And if the determinant is 0,
then we know in this situation

173
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,580
that a/c must equal b/d.

174
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,120
So a/c is equal to b/d.

175
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,050
So what does that tell us?

176
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,730
Well let me draw it.

177
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,710
And maybe numbers would
be more helpful here.

178
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,950
But I think you'll get
the intuition.

179
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,390
I'll just draw the
first quadrant.

180
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,282
I'll just assume both sectors
are in the first quadrant.

181
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:10,835
Let me draw.

182
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:17,990
   

183
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,590
The vector ac.

184
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,755
Let's say that this is a.

185
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:23,072
Let me do it in a
different color.

186
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,860
So I'm gonna draw
the vector ac.

187
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,540
So if this is a, and this
is c, then the vector

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,870
ac looks like that.

189
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,260
Let me draw it.

190
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,210
I want to make this neat.

191
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,440
The vector ac is like that.

192
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,120
And then we have the arrow.

193
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,950
And what would the vector
bd look like?

194
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,700
   

195
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,310
Well the vector bd--
And I could draw

196
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,210
it arbitrarily someplace.

197
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,580
But we're assuming that there's
no derivative-- sorry,

198
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,660
no determinant.

199
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,330
Have I been saying derivative
the whole time?

200
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,090
I hope not.

201
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,380
Well, we're assuming
that there's no

202
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,070
determinant to this matrix.

203
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,010
So if there's no determinant,
we know that

204
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,510
a/c is equal to b/d.

205
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,120
Or another way to view it is
that c/d is equal to d/b.

206
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,930
But what that tells you is that
both of these vectors

207
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,350
kind of have the same slope.

208
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,580
So if they both start at point
0, they're going to go in the

209
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,140
same direction.

210
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,500
They might have a different
magnitude, but they're going

211
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,080
to go in the same direction.

212
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:37,010
So if this is point b, and this
is point d, vector bd is

213
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,540
going to be here.

214
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,050
And if that's not obvious to
you, think a little bit about

215
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,080
why these two vectors, if this
is true, are going to point in

216
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,200
the same direction.

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,020
So that vector is going to
essentially overlap.

218
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,040
It's going to have the same
direction as this vector, but

219
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,260
it's just going to have
a different magnitude.

220
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,730
It might have the
same magnitude.

221
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,480
So my question to you is, vector
ef, we don't know where

222
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,600
vector ef is.

223
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,190
Well let's pick some
arbitrary point.

224
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,080
Let's say that this is
e, and this is f.

225
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,700
So this is vector ef up there.

226
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,130
Let me do it in a
different color.

227
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,250
Vector ef, let's
say it's there.

228
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,420
   

229
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,510
So my question to you is, if
these two vectors are in the

230
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,310
same direction.

231
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,850
Maybe of different magnitude.

232
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,620
Is there any way that you can
add or subtract combinations

233
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,140
of these two vectors to
get to this vector?

234
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,420
Well no, you can scale these
vectors and add them.

235
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,650
And all you're going to do is
kind of move along this line.

236
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,610
You can get to any
other vector.

237
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,800
There's a multiple of one
of these vectors.

238
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,990
But because these are the exact
same direction, you

239
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,560
can't get to any vector that's
in a different direction.

240
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,050
So if this vector is in a
different direction, there's

241
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,260
no solution here.

242
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,530
If this vector just happened to
be in the same direction as

243
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,980
this, then there would be a
solution, where you could just

244
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,790
scale those.

245
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,100
Actually, there would be an
infinite number of solutions

246
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
in terms of x and y.

247
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,580
But if the vector is slightly
different, in terms of its

248
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,320
direction, then there
is no solution.

249
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,310
There is no combination of this
vector and this vector

250
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,980
that can add you
up to this one.

251
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,385
And it's something for you
think about a little bit.

252
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,360
It might be obvious to you.

253
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,730
But another way to think about
it is, when you're trying to

254
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,000
take sums of vectors, any other
vector, in order to move

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,150
it in that direction, you have
to have a little bit of one

256
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,470
direction and a little bit of
another direction, to get to

257
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,230
any other vector.

258
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,520
And if both of your ingredient
vectors are the same

259
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,240
direction, there's no way to
get to a different one.

260
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,450
Anyway, I'm probably just being
circular in what I'm

261
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,240
explaining.

262
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,150
But that hopefully gives you a
little bit of an intuition of

263
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,800
well, one, you now know what
a singular matrix is.

264
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,850
You know when you can not
find its inverse.

265
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,320
You know that when the
determinant is 0, you won't

266
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,800
find an inverse.

267
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,730
And hopefully-- and this was
the whole point of this

268
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,870
video-- you have an intuition
of why that is.

269
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,050
Because if you're looking at the
vector problem, there's no

270
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,830
way that you can find-- that
either there's no solution to

271
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,650
finding the combination of the
vectors that get you to that

272
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,200
vector, or there are
an infinite number.

273
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,030
And the same thing is
true of finding the

274
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,090
intersection of two lines.

275
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,480
They're either parallel, or
they're the same line, if the

276
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,640
determinant is 0.

277
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,850
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.

278
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,500
