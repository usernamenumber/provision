1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,270
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,190
I shouldn't try to squeeze in videos because then I rush,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,800
and then you won't learn, and everything breaks down.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,840
So problem number 7,a,b,and c are different positive integers

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,480
and 2 to the a times 2 to the b times 2 to the c

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,550
is equal to 64. They want to know

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:26,380
what is 2 to the a plus 2 to the b plus 2 to the c?

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,670
Well, here two things we can use.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,490
We can use our exponent rules where if we have the same base

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,780
and we multiply it we can just add the exponents.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,970
So this is equal to 2 to the a plus b plus c.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,090
Then, can we write 64 as a power of 2? Sure.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,090
Let's see, 2 to the third is equal to 8 and 64 is 8 squared.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,240
So if we square both sides of that, that's 2 to the sixth.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,860
You might already know that, 2 to the sixth is 64.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,170
You could think of it as 2 to the fifth is 32.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,960
2 to the sixth is 64, of course.

18
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,100
So a plus b plus c has to equal 6.

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,280
What do they tell us?

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,320
a, b and c are different positive integers.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,860
So what are a, b and c?

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,030
Well let's see, they could be 1, 2 and 3, right?

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,550
Because 1 plus 2 plus 3 is equal to 6.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,630
So there we have it. a, b, and c are 1, 2 and 3.

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,200
So 2 to the a plus 2 to the b plus 2 to the c is

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,090
the same thing as 2 to the 1, plus 2 squared, plus 2 cubed.

27
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:47,410
That's equal to 2 plus 4 plus 8. 6 plus 8 is equal to 14.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:56,170
That is choice A.Next problem,I'll switch colors for variety.

29
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:03,910
Problem number 8, in the xy plane, the center of a circle

30
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,000
has the coordinates 3 comma minus 7.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,540
Let's see if I have to draw this.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,670
If one endpoint of a diameter of the circle

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,380
is minus 2 comma 7--

34
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,960
so this is an endpoint of the diameter, this is center--

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,650
what are the coordinates of the other endpoint

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,360
of this diameter? Well sure, maybe I'll draw it for you,

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,640
just so you get a sense of all this action that's going on.

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,520
So the center is 3 comma negative 7.

39
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,190
So this is 3-- let me do it in a different color--

40
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,660
3, minus 7. So this is the center.

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,110
This one diameter is at negative 2, 7.

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,050
Actually, I drew this too big. So this is one endpoint.

43
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,700
So actually the circle is going to be huge.

44
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,530
Actually let me redraw this

45
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,160
because it's going to be a huge circle.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,180
I didn't do this appropriately.

47
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,540
This is the coordinate axes-- I'll draw it big like this.

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,460
So the center-- and I'll do it in a different color--

49
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:45,800
the center is at 3, then minus 7. Right?

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,060
And then one endpoint is at minus 2. Oh no. You know what?

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,510
I misread the problem.

52
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,780
The other endpoint is at minus 2, minus 7.

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,720
So the other endpoint is here, minus 2, minus 7.

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,570
So it's here. So I could use this graph.

55
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,680
So the other endpoint is minus 2, minus 7.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,130
It shows you how important it is

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,970
to read these problems properly. So if you drew the circle,

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,840
the circle actually looks something like this.

59
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,200
The important thing to realize--

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,360
and you actually didn't even have to draw the circle--

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,570
is that this diameter, it.

62
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,510
this is the diameter that they're talking about.

63
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,440
I know I'm drawing it kind of funny,

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,660
but this is the point right here, 3, minus 7.

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,220
This is minus 2, minus 7.

66
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,560
So to go from this point to this point

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,490
we didn't change our y-coordinates. We just changed x.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,350
What did we do? We went how far back?

69
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,730
We went from x equals 3 to x equals minus 2.

70
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,900
So we went 5 back, right?

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,910
So the other endpoint of the diameter--

72
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,950
we just have to go 5 in this direction.

73
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,130
So if we started x equals 3,

74
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,090
we're going to end up with x equals 8.

75
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,410
Then the y is going to stay the same

76
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,730
because we're moving horizontally. So it's 8, negative 7.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,040
That is choice E. Sorry for misreading it at first,

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,520
but that shows it can happen to the best of us.

79
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,370
No, just kidding. I'm not even the best of us.

80
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,940
All right, next problem.

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:29,860
9, a regulation for riding a certain amusement park ride

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,330
requires that a child be between 30 inches

83
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,060
and 50 inches tall. So between 30,

84
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,050
so height has to be greater than 30

85
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,730
and less than 50 inches tall. Fair enough.

86
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,970
Which of the following inequalities can be used to determine

87
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,600
whether or not a child's height satisfies the regulation

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,170
for this ride? OK, so they are essentially

89
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,720
just rewriting this equation and saying it as absolute value.

90
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,640
A number line could probably be useful here.

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,600
So if I say--that's my number line--

92
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:12,890
this is 30 and this is 50.We know, just from this inequality,

93
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,240
that my height can be anywhere around here.

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,760
Whenever I see these absolute value problems,

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
they're really picking kind of a median,

96
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,180
or the middle point, between the two,

97
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,190
and they're using the absolute value to say,

98
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,410
well my distance away from that middle point

99
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,970
can't be more than a certain amount.

100
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,150
So what you can do is you can pick the middle point.

101
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,120
If you want to convert this into an absolute value equation,

102
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,200
you pick the middle point. So what's the middle point?

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,880
30 plus 50 is 80. The middle point is 40, right?

104
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,120
I should have been able to do it in my head

105
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,910
because it's 10 away from each other. So we can say--

106
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,160
instead of saying that the height has to be greater than 30

107
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,030
or the height has to be less than 50--

108
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,580
we could say that the difference between the height and 40,

109
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,290
and it's absolute value-- we don't care

110
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,180
if the height is less than 40 or greater than 40--

111
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,320
but that absolute distance between the height

112
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,750
and 40 can't be more than what?

113
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,280
Well, we can't go more than 10 to the positive

114
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,180
and we can't go more than 10 to the negative.

115
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,370
So the absolute value has to be less than 10.

116
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,790
That's how you should you can view this.

117
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,570
If you wanted to convert this to absolute value,

118
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,490
how they tend to do it on the SAT,

119
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,920
pick the average point and then

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,710
figure out how far can you vary from the average?

121
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,810
The average point was 40,and you can vary at most 10.

122
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,200
So the difference between the height

123
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,770
and 40 has to be less than 10.

124
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,850
This could also have been written as 40 minus h

125
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,050
is less than 10.

126
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,510
But the choice is h minus 40 is less than 10,

127
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:55,710
and that is choice D. Problem 10, a right,

128
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,510
circular cylinder with radius 5 and height 4 has volume V.

129
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,970
In terms of V-- oh look at that. OK.

130
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,390
So a right, circular cylinder, so it looks like this.

131
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,920
That's the base. That's the top of the cylinder.

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,430
Then you have a line like that and you have a line like that.

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,550
What are they telling us? They're telling us it's radius 5.

134
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:36,470
So this distance is 5, radius 5, height 4. The volume is V.

135
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,280
OK, so the volume is V. So what does V equal?

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,630
So V is equal to--

137
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,370
you just have to figure out the area of the space.

138
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,960
Actually I have a minute left.

139
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,070
So I'm going to do problem number 10 in the next video

140
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,200
so as to not rush it.
