1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,200
All right.

3
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,890
We're on problem 17.

4
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,450
It says, which of the following
best describes the

5
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,505
triangles shown below?

6
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:10,810
   

7
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,955
OK, they want to know,
are the similar?

8
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:12,550
Are they congruent?

9
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,800
Et cetera.

10
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,740
   

11
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,590
They tell us that this
is a 60 degree angle.

12
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,190
This is a 90 degree angle, they
do this little square

13
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,390
thing there.

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,390
The angles in a triangle
have to add up to 180.

15
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,190
So if this is 90, this is
60, that adds up to 150.

16
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,420
So this has to be
180 minus 150.

17
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,080
So this has to be a
30 degree angle.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,460
So that has to be 30 degrees
right there.

19
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,200
Fair enough.

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,460
Now let's get this one.

21
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,280
That's 30, that's 90.

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,450
Well, by the same argument,
this has got to be 60.

23
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,960
Because they all have
to add up to 180.

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,430
All right.

25
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,770
So just there we know that all
of the angles in both of the

26
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,400
triangles are congruent.

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,320
Or that their measures
are equal.

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,230
So we know already that
these are definitely

29
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,480
both similar triangles.

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,970
   

31
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,300
Now, a similar triangle also
tells us that the ratio of all

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,600
of the sides are equal.

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,450
So.

34
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,530
if you just sort of eyeball it,
if you said, OK, the side

35
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,100
opposite the 90 degree, these
are the corresponding sides,

36
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,170
the ratios are equal.

37
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,080
But we see that they give
us the actual lengths.

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,290
So the hypotenuse of both
of these triangles is 8.

39
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,350
So the ratio is actually 1:1.

40
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,740
And when the ratio of the sides
is 1:1, when the sides

41
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,400
are actually congruent, and if
you're just given one side,

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,040
that's enough.

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,770
Then you could actually figure
out the rest of them using a

44
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,430
little trigonometry or
something like that.

45
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,120
We're not going to go
there just yet.

46
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,630
But in geometry class, you
learned that if something is

47
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,300
similar and and at least one of
the corresponding sides is

48
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,370
congruent, then the whole thing

49
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,250
is going to be congruent.

50
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,495
So these are both similar
and congruent triangles.

51
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:50,340
   

52
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,410
Both similar and congruent,
that's A.

53
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,580
Problem 18.

54
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,140
OK, let me cut and paste it.

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,530
   

56
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,500
Which of the following
statements must be true if

57
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,070
triangle GHI is similar.

58
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,690
   

59
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,570
So if they write this that
means congruent.

60
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,020
If they just write that,
that means similar.

61
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,130
Which of the following
statements must be true if

62
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,540
triangle GHI is similar
to triangle JKL?

63
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,410
So even before looking at the
choices, that means that the

64
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,200
ratio of all the sides are
the same, or all of the

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,620
angles are the same.

66
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,140
Let's see what they give us.

67
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,660
The two triangles
must be scalene.

68
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,990
Now, you have similar triangles
that are isosceles

69
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,670
or equilateral.

70
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,440
That's not right.

71
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,320
The two triangles must have
exactly one acute angle.

72
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:54,740
   

73
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,210
No, they could have
two acute angles.

74
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,570
They could have three
acute angles.

75
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,370
The way that they've drawn
it here, actually

76
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,440
all of them are acute.

77
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,120
None of these angles are greater
than 90 degrees just

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
the way they've drawn.

79
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,530
So that's not right.

80
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,620
Some of these statements
are so crazy that

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,590
they're hard to process.

82
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,050
Anyway, C, at least one of the
sides of the two triangles

83
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,530
must be parallel.

84
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,780
I don't care how they're
oriented.

85
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,430
   

86
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,630
You don't care about the
orientation of the triangles.

87
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,540
The corresponding sides of
the triangles must be

88
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,300
proportional.

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah, that's one of the ways
that you know that something

90
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,500
is similar.

91
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,290
That the corresponding sides
are proportional.

92
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,790
So that is, D.

93
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,600
So this is almost, do you
know the definition

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,380
of a similar triangle?

95
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,860
Question 19.

96
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,010
Let me erase this.

97
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,480
OK.

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
I have copied it.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,760
Now I am pasting it.

100
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,490
In the figure below, AC
is congruent to DF.

101
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,240
OK, so they're equal
to each other.

102
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,300
AC and DF are congruent.

103
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,185
And angle A is congruent
to angle D.

104
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:20,970
   

105
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,480
Fair enough.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,900
That's angle A, that's
angle D.

107
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,000
That's what they tell us.

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Which additional information
would be enough to prove that

109
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,070
triangle ABC is congruent
to DEF?

110
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,520
So they just gave us one
side and one angle.

111
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,000
If they gave us another side,
if they said that DE is

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,130
congruent to AB, that'd
be pretty cool.

113
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:47,410
If they gave us this angle, if
they said angle F is congruent

114
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,720
to angle C, that'd be good.

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
Let's see what they give us.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,610
AB is congruent to DE.

117
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,940
Yeah, sure.

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,420
If AB is congruent to DE
then we definitely

119
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,260
have congruent triangles.

120
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,090
And you know the theorem that
you would have to say in your

121
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,270
geometry class is, I have a
side, an angle, and a side.

122
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,180
So you would say by SAS, by
side, angle, side, I know that

123
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,390
these two triangles
are congruent.

124
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,520
So AB is congruent to DE.

125
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,410
Let's look at the other
ones to make sure

126
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,390
we didn't miss anything.

127
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,640
AB is congruent to BC.

128
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,680
   

129
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,560
Well, that's fine.

130
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,180
But that doesn't tell us
how AB relates to DE.

131
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,730
So that's a useless statement.

132
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,420
BC is congruent to EF.

133
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,440
   

134
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,130
Well, see, this is another
time that I have a slight

135
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,870
problem with the way they're
going with this.

136
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,580
Because if BC were
congruent to EF.

137
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:55,300
   

138
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,360
Let me think about that.

139
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,680
Could I draw this triangle
in a way where

140
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,530
they're still not congruent.

141
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,950
Because I have this angle
here constraining it.

142
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,090
They told us that.

143
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,100
So it's not like I can
draw this line,

144
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,920
FE, coming out here.

145
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Because if it came out here,
then DE would have

146
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,680
to come like that.

147
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,990
And then this angle couldn't
be what they said it was.

148
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,590
So I'm just trying to think, I
actually think that would be

149
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,840
sufficient.

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,280
   

151
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,970
If you're given that this side
is congruent to that side.

152
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,420
I think you could make a
trigonometric argument very

153
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,440
easily to show that these two
triangles have equal sides.

154
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,960
But anyway, I'm not going
to bother with that.

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,360
Let's see.

156
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,490
Let's look at choice D.

157
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,000
BC is congruent to DE.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,340
   

159
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,070
Well, these aren't even
corresponding sides.

160
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,890
So that's clearly useless.

161
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,620
I have a suspicion that
this would have also

162
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,800
been enough to prove.

163
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,500
But anyway, I don't want
to insult anyone in the

164
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,770
California Department of
Education, but I'm slightly

165
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,250
disappointed by some
of these questions.

166
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,270
Because I feel like they
really aren't testing

167
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,060
intuition, they're just testing
to see whether you

168
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,910
know the definitions of some of
these geometric terms. And

169
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,780
whether you can spout out, side,
angle, side, and angle,

170
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,370
side, angle.

171
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,450
And things like that.

172
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,230
And you're going to forget those
about three hours after

173
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,910
you take the test. That's
pretty useless.

174
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,490
What's useful is if you know
something that gives you an

175
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,740
intuition about triangles.

176
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,830
That's going to be useful for
you on the SAT, that's going

177
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,690
to be useful for you when
you take trigonometry.

178
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,500
And I'll tell you
a dirty secret.

179
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,620
You will never use ASA theorem
or SAS theorem or anything

180
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,560
like that again in your
mathematical careers.

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,350
Your 9th or 10th grade geometry
class is the first

182
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,180
and the last time that
you'll ever see them.

183
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,530
So I have a slight problem
where they want you to

184
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,980
memorize these theorems
and all of that.

185
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,770
And even some of this notation
never shows up again in your

186
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,980
mathematical careers.

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,120
Even if you do a PhD
in mathematics.

188
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,990
The only time you'll probably
see it again is if you become

189
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,320
a geometry math teacher.

190
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,980
Anyway, but it's good.

191
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,710
I mean you should know how to do
this stuff at minimum just

192
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,740
to jump through that
loop that society

193
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,150
makes us all jump through.

194
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,560
So problem 20.

195
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,700
You don't want someone else to
get paid more just because

196
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,600
they were willing
to say SAS, ASA.

197
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,660
Anyway, all right, problem 20.

198
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,290
Given AB and CD intersect
at point E.

199
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,450
   

200
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,240
And just another aside, I think
you can even tell from

201
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,669
my tone that I enjoy the SAT
problems a lot more.

202
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,510
Because in some ways, in fact,
in every way, the SAT problems

203
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,070
really test your understanding
of geometry, but never do they

204
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,180
mention the words similar,
congruent, SAS, ASA.

205
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,220
They never mention all these
things that you essentially

206
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,960
memorize in your
geometry class.

207
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,860
And I know tons of people who
get A's in geometry and then

208
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,310
they don't do well on the SAT.

209
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,050
And I know people who
do the other way.

210
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,700
And frankly, I'd rather
hire the person who

211
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,590
does well on the SAT.

212
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,710
Because that's the person who
I think has the intuition.

213
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,950
But anyway, we have
to do this.

214
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,490
And I probably shouldn't
rant like that.

215
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,666
Given AB and CD intersect
at point E.

216
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:20,500
   

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,570
Fair enough.

218
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,100
And they tell us that angle
1 is congruent to angle 2.

219
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,330
So that and that are equal.

220
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,990
All right, so already
those look like

221
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,940
alternate interior angles.

222
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,010
If this line were parallel.

223
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,940
In fact, I think that's enough
to show that this line is

224
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,190
parallel to this line.

225
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,120
   

226
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,620
Because, if you view this as a
transversal, if you view DC as

227
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,310
a transversal, then you see
that's a transversal between

228
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,530
these two lines.

229
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,600
And because the alternate
interior angles are the same,

230
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,540
or they're congruent, you know
that those are going to be

231
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,650
parallel lines.

232
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,210
But anyway, I don't know if
that's at all useful.

233
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:00,350
What are they going to ask us?

234
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:09,190
Which theorem or postulate can
be used to prove that AED is

235
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,480
similar to BEC.

236
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,000
OK.

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,470
So let's see, so I didn't
have to even say those

238
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,495
are parallel lines.

239
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,390
So what do they tell us?

240
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,040
First of all, we know that 3
and 4 are congruent angles,

241
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,990
because they're opposite
angles.

242
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,120
Once again, I don't like the
word vertical angles, because

243
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,060
these angles are clearly
not vertical.

244
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,270
They're more side by side.

245
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,470
But they're definitely
opposite.

246
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,890
So those two angles
are the same.

247
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,750
   

248
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,560
1 and 2 are the same, 3
and 4 are the same.

249
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,250
If you know two of the
angles in a triangle,

250
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:46,910
you know the third.

251
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,670
So this angle and that angle
have to be the same.

252
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,070
But in general, if you know that
two angles of a triangle

253
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,890
are the same, the third
has to be the same.

254
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,130
So, that tells you that it's
a similar triangle.

255
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,350
So we could use angle, angle.

256
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,140
We know that two angles are the
same as two other angles.

257
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,430
So we know we're dealing
with similar triangles.

258
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,520
Anyway, all out of time
because of my rant.

259
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,500
See you in the next video.

260
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:10,900
