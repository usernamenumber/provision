1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,503
What I want to do is give you a broad overview

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,177
of all of the wars that France was in at this time,

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,384
and then talk about -- in a little bit more detail --

4
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,337
exactly what Napoleon was up to,

5
00:00:09,337 --> 00:00:10,780
and his role in

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,376
either beginning or ending many of these wars.

7
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:21,435
So, you might remember, from 1792 to 1797,

8
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:27,471
you had your war of the First Coalition.

9
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:29,105
And the players there were

10
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:37,865
Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain.

11
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,935
(I'll just write "Britain" for short.)

12
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:43,194
And this was essentially started by the French.

13
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:46,941
You might remember, King Louis XVI was alive then.

14
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,795
He supported the war, because he thought

15
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:49,962
that they [the French people] would lose

16
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,422
and maybe reinstate him;

17
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:52,888
or that it would make him popular.

18
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,415
The revolutionaries liked the war

19
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:57,349
because they wanted to spread the Revolution.

20
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,659
And, you might remember,

21
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:07,754
it ended at the Treaty of Campo Formio, in 1797,

22
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:12,001
due mainly to Napoleon's victories in Italy.

23
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,297
(This was Campo Formio there.)

24
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:15,125
At that time,

25
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,722
he was in charge of the Italian Campaign;

26
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:20,498
and the government of France, at that time,

27
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,899
was the Directory -- in power, to a large degree,

28
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,567
because of Napoleon's ability to defend them.

29
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:33,643
Then, from 1798-- (Let me do this in a different color.)

30
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:42,147
From 1798 to 1802, you have the Second Coalition.

31
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,560
Now, you might immediately see,

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,041
Napoleon took power at the end of 1799.

33
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,422
So this war spanned

34
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:50,238
some of the Directory being in control,

35
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:53,499
and some of Napoleon, as First Consul,

36
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,161
being in control.

37
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,760
And here the players -- once again --

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,747
you have Austria and Great Britain --

39
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,663
(They tend to be always at war with France

40
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,093
in this period -- especially Great Britain.)

41
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:11,090
And instead of Prussia, you have Russia.

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,825
And actually, just to help you visualize

43
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,354
what the Austrian Empire looked like at this time --

44
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:16,569
and the Prussian Empire --

45
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,567
(This map doesn't do it in justice.)

46
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,498
-- let me go down to this map.

47
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,487
That's in 1810.

48
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:25,511
Let me go a little bit earlier here.

49
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:27,094
This is in 1805.

50
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,380
And I'll draw the boundaries

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,094
a little bit bolder than they did.

52
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,138
So this is France.

53
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:35,135
These are the boundaries of France.

54
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:39,598
Actually, it was able to take some territory

55
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:41,278
in what is now Italy.

56
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:44,434
So this is-- That is France, right there.

57
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,764
I could do the whole boundary, if you like.

58
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:47,941
But I think you get the idea.

59
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:50,606
But the one empire that existed then,

60
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:53,735
that doesn't exist in its current form, was Prussia.

61
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:54,504
It doesn't even exist at all.

62
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,295
There is no Prussian Empire, or Prussian nation,

63
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:00,140
or the country of Prussia, anymore.

64
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,184
You can see there [that]

65
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,271
It had some overlap with Germany,

66
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:05,478
some overlap with Poland, some [with] other countries

67
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:06,689
-- (I won't go into detail there.)

68
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,371
Then you have the Austrian Empire.

69
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:16,803
([The] Austrian Empire is right over there.)

70
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:17,507
As you can see,

71
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:21,428
it is much...it encompasses much more than just

72
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,931
the modern nation, or country, of Austria.

73
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,425
Then, you have the Russian Empire,

74
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,858
which, you know, give or take,

75
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,439
looks not too different than Russia today.

76
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,966
But the big difference between [this part of] the world

77
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,164
(There [are] many differences.)

78
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,502
-- between the world now and the world then

79
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:39,565
was that there was no nation of Germany.

80
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:41,560
You had a bunch of people speaking German;

81
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,756
but they were divided into

82
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,436
a bunch of small little states.

83
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:45,424
This map doesn't show it.

84
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,235
Some of them were under Austrian control;

85
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,341
some of them were under Prussian control.

86
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:51,420
And this loose confederation of

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,102
German kingdoms and states,

88
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,771
this was called the Holy Roman Empire.

89
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:58,466
Let me write that down.

90
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:04,066
(WRITING: Holy Roman Empire.)

91
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,422
And as Voltaire famously said,

92
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:08,933
they were neither "holy," nor "Roman."

93
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,461
They didn't speak Latin. They weren't Italian.

94
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,003
They were German.

95
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,534
It wasn't holy. This wasn't you know,

96
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:16,126
controlled by a religious figure.

97
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,293
And it wasn't an empire.

98
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:19,700
It wasn't a tightly controlled state

99
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,331
that was kind of expanding its boundaries.

100
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:23,334
It was this loose confederation of kingdoms.

101
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,956
So, that gives you a visualization

102
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:28,060
of what the world looked like right then.

103
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,063
So, with that in mind, let me go back to my overview,

104
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,732
my overview, right there.

105
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:41,635
And then, the Second Coalition, it was ended, well--

106
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:48,459
In 1801, you had the Treaty of Luneville.

107
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:53,986
Once again, this was a defeat of the Austrians,

108
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,482
mainly due to the military capabilities.

109
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:59,216
Napoleon was now in charge of France.

110
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,416
But he led, once again,

111
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:07,077
an Italian campaign against the Austrians.

112
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:09,415
This is his victory in Marengo right there --

113
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:10,554
(I'll go into a little more detail on that.)

114
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,087
-- and that essentially declared victory on Austria,

115
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:17,733
[and] allowed Napoleon to take more territory in..

116
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,137
along the Italian peninsula.

117
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:22,049
You can see it right there,

118
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,888
along the Italian peninsula, right there.

119
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:28,687
And then later he had the Treaty of Amiens

120
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:31,830
with the British in 1802.

121
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,357
And that really ended the coalition.

122
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,955
I guess you could say the coalition ended in 1801,

123
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:36,499
because Austria was out of it.

124
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,379
Russia was kind of just passively observing.

125
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,018
They participated, but they didn't really

126
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:41,830
give or take or lose anything.

127
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,802
And then, I could say at this point,

128
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:49,172
the United Kingdom-- Essentially, I guess,

129
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,225
the best explanation of why that it was "war fatigue."

130
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,427
But we'll see that they weren't tired for long.

131
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:58,828
Because then, in May of 1803,

132
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:01,010
you have the beginning of your Third Coalition.

133
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,160
And I'll go into a little bit more detail about this.

134
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,605
[In] the Third Coalition,

135
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,576
Britain declares war

136
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:09,166
on what we could call "the French Empire."

137
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,191
And this isn't going to end until 1805.

138
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,402
So, you can see, Great Britain

139
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:17,993
is essentially at war almost, well really, continuously.

140
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:20,632
There [are] a few gaps, give or take.

141
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,267
But there's always this tension.

142
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:27,539
This is the Third Coalition.

143
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,960
And once again, we have--

144
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,161
(I could write "the United Kingdom," if you like;

145
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:32,760
because they actually now [are]

146
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,703
"the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland."

147
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,627
You have the United Kingdom in there.

148
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:42,664
We have Russia in there.

149
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:44,016
And once again, we have Austria.

150
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:45,112
And there were other players.

151
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:45,966
There was Portugal.

152
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,608
But these were the prime players.

153
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,097
And we'll see in this video that this,

154
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:53,436
the Third Coalition -- war of the Third Coalition,

155
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:56,640
really ended with Napoleon being the

156
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,933
dominant power in Europe.

157
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,404
And ended with him essentially thinking that

158
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,861
he is unstoppable.

159
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,266
So I'll do a little bit more detail on that.

160
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,598
This resulted, in 1805,

161
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,470
with the then Emperor Napoleon.

162
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,150
And we'll talk about how he became emperor.

163
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,165
But in 1805, Napoleon -- (Maybe I should say 1806,

164
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,796
because this ended at the end of 1805.) --

165
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:28,003
Napoleon views himself as unstoppable, as invincible.

166
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:29,763
He got some good victories that

167
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,232
fed his already large ego.

168
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,157
So, with this as an overview, let's, I guess,

169
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:37,240
review a little bit of the life of Napoleon

170
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,098
and the roles that he directly played

171
00:07:39,098 --> 00:07:42,519
in pretty much all of these conflicts.

172
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,364
So the first time we heard about Napoleon

173
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,001
was in 1793. (And I'll just draw it right here.)

174
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,704
You might remember, there were all of these

175
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,641
Royalist insurrections going on

176
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:54,679
against the revolutionary government.

177
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:57,689
And they had this bright artillery captain in Toulon,

178
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,923
who put down an uprising there in 1793.

179
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,097
He got some, I guess you could say,

180
00:08:03,097 --> 00:08:09,014
France-wide, or nationwide fame from doing that.

181
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:13,538
Then in 1795, you might remember,

182
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:16,816
the Directory was trying to get formed in Paris.

183
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:19,429
So this is 1793.

184
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:24,482
Then in 1795-- (Let me do a better color than that.

185
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:25,919
That's hard to read.)

186
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,301
In 1795, he was...he defended the Tuileries

187
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,302
by essentially sending out that grapeshot

188
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,709
and mowing down people to keep the Royalists

189
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,575
from taking out the revolutionary government.

190
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,464
So once again, hugely, hugely popular.

191
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,763
So that was in 17...

192
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,406
So all of that was occurring during the war

193
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:48,058
of the First Coalition.

194
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:52,087
And then, Napoleon was sent... was made the general

195
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,047
in charge of the Italian campaign.

196
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:59,832
And in 1797, he was essentially able to end

197
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,226
the war of the First Coalition

198
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,299
in a victorious way for France,

199
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,842
by defeating Austria and Italy.

200
00:09:05,842 --> 00:09:07,385
And that ended the First Coalition

201
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:08,717
with the Campo Formio.

202
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:10,067
This was Napoleon.

203
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:14,752
That was Napoleon right there.

204
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,565
Then, you might remember--

205
00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:19,152
OK, you know, he's this hugely popular guy.

206
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:22,084
He actually started publishing some newspapers.

207
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,209
And he actually sent some military generals

208
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,046
to put down further counterrevolutions

209
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,290
on the part of the Royalists.

210
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,019
So he became even more and more popular.

211
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,228
And the Directory was a little bit

212
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,774
afraid of him at this point. So they said,

213
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:37,354
hey why don't you go do whatever you want.

214
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:40,308
And that's when Napoleon, he left from Toulon,

215
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,855
and he went to Egypt --

216
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:45,952
he went to Egypt with his visions of grandeur,

217
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,696
where he did all of the damage down there,

218
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:53,438
and killed, and won multiple wars

219
00:09:53,438 --> 00:09:56,564
against the Ottomans in both Egypt and Syria.

220
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:57,437
But unfortunately for him,

221
00:09:57,437 --> 00:10:01,468
his good friend Horatio Nelson

222
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:05,111
destroyed his whole fleet in the Battle of the Nile.

223
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,950
Horatio-- (Let me draw that in a darker color.)

224
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,822
So, that is--

225
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:14,551
Horatio Nelson destroyed his entire fleet there.

226
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,757
So they were stranded.

227
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:19,331
In 1799, Napoleon was essentially able to

228
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:22,023
abandon all of his troops

229
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:25,101
and then come back to France on his own.

230
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:28,105
So this is in 1799.

231
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:34,096
Napoleon makes his way back to France.

232
00:10:34,096 --> 00:10:35,502
And then, we saw, in the last video,

233
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,615
he takes power with two of the directors

234
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:41,282
as the three consuls of France.

235
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:44,156
But in short order, he is able to declare himself

236
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:49,021
as First Consul in 1799.

237
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,221
(This is hard to read. Let me do this.)

238
00:10:51,221 --> 00:11:01,024
So, in 1799, he is First Consul, and is essentially

239
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:07,227
the dictator, or the authoritarian ruler, of France.

240
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:08,565
But [while] this was happening-- remember,

241
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:11,880
this was all during this war of the Second Coalition.

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,295
In 1798, you know, he wasn't much help in that war,

243
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:18,019
he was out in Egypt doing all of these silly things.

244
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,946
They were at war with Britain-- (That's why

245
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,561
Horatio Nelson went and destroyed his fleet.)

246
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:27,937
But even after he takes power at the end of 1799,

247
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,981
or early 1800 they're still at war.

248
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,359
So, Napoleon, he decides to take things..take charge.

249
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:38,743
So,he leads the troops across the Alps into Italy.

250
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:40,821
Into Italy right here.

251
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:42,819
And once again, this pattern is emerging.

252
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,791
And [in] this one, actually,

253
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,353
[it] wasn't very clear in the beginning

254
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:47,724
that it was going to go his way.

255
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,572
The Italian Campaign had started very badly.

256
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:52,488
But eventually, he was able to win against,

257
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:53,901
once again, the Austrians

258
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:57,645
at the Battle of Marengo and Hohenlinden.

259
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,368
I know I'm probably not saying all of these well.

260
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,315
But once again, through Napoleon

261
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:05,033
directly leading the troops,

262
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,743
he was able to end the war of the Second Coalition.

263
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,986
And then the United Kingdom, or Great Britain,

264
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:14,350
however you want to call it-- (Great Britain tends to...)

265
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,095
Many times when people use the word "Great Britain,"

266
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:20,358
it's referring to the entire United Kingdom

267
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,022
of Great Britain and Ireland.

268
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,025
If you wanted to be formal,

269
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:26,189
"Great Britain" refers just to the island of Great Britain

270
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,418
that has England and Scotland and Wales on it,

271
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,923
while this is Ireland.

272
00:12:30,923 --> 00:12:33,083
But I don't [want to] keep repeatedly saying

273
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,179
"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,"

274
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:38,355
which was now united in the early 1800s.

275
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:40,917
I'll just keep saying Great Britain.

276
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,972
But there was just fatigue. So,

277
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:46,286
the war essentially ended with Great Britain as well.

278
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,730
This is, as we said before,

279
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,173
this was the Treaty of Amiens.

280
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:54,979
But very, very, very, short-lived peace.

281
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:59,405
Because in 1803, with Napoleon still in power,

282
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:03,349
the Third Coalition formed.

283
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,038
And in the next video, we're going to see exactly

284
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:08,956
how Napoleon was able to, once again,

285
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,771
be victorious over these powers to become,

286
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,771
essentially, in his mind, invincible.
