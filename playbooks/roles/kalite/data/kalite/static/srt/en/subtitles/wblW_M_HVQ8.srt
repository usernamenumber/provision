1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:05,133
I'm going to define a function S of n

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,759
and I'm going to define it as

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:16,754
the sum of all positive integers

4
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:22,221
including N.

5
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:24,995
And so the domain of this function is really all

6
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:28,533
positive integers - N has to be a positive integer.

7
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,467
And so we can try this out with a few things, we can

8
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:35,200
take S of 3, this is going to be equal to 1 plus

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,071
2 plus 3, which is equal to 6. We could take S of

10
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:46,610
4, which is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4,

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,225
which is going to be equal to 10.

12
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:57,441
Now what I want to do in this video is prove to you that

13
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:02,200
I can write this as a function of N, that the sum of all

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
positive integers up to and including N is equal to

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:11,400
n times n plus one, all of that over 2.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,821
And the way I'm going to prove it to you is by induction.

17
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:23,785
Proof by induction.

18
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:27,867
The way you do a proof by induction is first, you prove

19
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:36,871
the base case. This is what we need to prove.

20
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:41,933
We're going to first prove it for 1 - that will be our base case.

21
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:47,400
And then we're going to do the induction step, which

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
is essentialy saying "If we assume it works for some

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,513
positive integer K", then we can prove it's going to work

24
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:59,467
for the next positive integer, for example K + 1.

25
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,995
And the reason why this works is - Let's say that

26
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:10,754
we prove both of these. So the base case we're going to prove it for 1.

27
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,800
But it doesn't always have to be 1.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,908
Your statement might be true for everything above 55.

29
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,667
Or everything above some threshold.

30
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:21,533
But in this case, we are saying this is true for all positive integers.

31
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,333
Our base case is going to be 1.

32
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:34,533
Then in our induction step, we are going to prove that if you assume that this thing is true,

33
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,333
for sum of k.

34
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:42,533
If we assume that then it is going to be true for sum of k + 1.

35
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:48,333
And the reason why this is all you have to do to prove this for all positive integers

36
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,000
it's just imagine:

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's think about all of the positive integers right over here.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,467
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 you could just keep going on forever.

39
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:00,200
So we are going to prove it for 1.

40
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,600
We are going to prove that this formula right over here,

41
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,067
this expression right over here applies for the case of 1, when n is 1.

42
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:12,867
And then we are going to prove that if we know it is true for any given k that is true for the next one

43
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:16,333
So if we know it is true for 1 in our base case then the second step,

44
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,067
this induction step must be true for 2 then.

45
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:22,867
Because we proved generally if it's true for k it's going to be true for k + 1.

46
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,733
When it's true for 2, then it must be true for 3,

47
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:29,600
because we have proved it, when it's true for k, it's true for k + 1.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,667
So if it's true for 2 it's true for 3.

49
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,067
and if it's true for 3 it's going to be true for 4.

50
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:37,667
You can just keep going on and on forever, which means it's true for everything.

51
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:43,533
Now spoken in generalaties let's actually prove this by induction.

52
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:51,800
So let's take the sum of, let's do this function on 1.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,533
that is just going to be the sum of all positive integers

54
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,800
including 1 is just literally going to be 1.

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,400
We've just added all of them, it is just 1.

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
There is no other positive integer up to and including 1.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,400
And now we can prove that this is the same thing as

58
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,600
1 times 1 pluss 1 all of that over 2.

59
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,533
1 plus 1 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1, 1 times 1 is 1.

60
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,533
So this formula right over here, this expression

61
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:23,267
it worked for 1, so we have proved our base case.

62
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,867
we have proven it for 1.

63
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:31,385
Now what I want to do is I want to assume that it works for some number k.

64
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:41,467
So I will assume true for some number k.

65
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:48,000
So i'm going to assume that for some number k, that this function at k is going to be equal to

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,133
k times k plus 1 over 2.

67
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,200
So I'm just assuming this is true for that.

68
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Now what I want to do is think about what happens when I try to find this function for k + 1.

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,133
This is what I'm assuming.

70
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,133
I'm assuming I know this.

71
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,200
Now let's try to do it for k + 1.

72
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:14,323
So what is the sum of all of the integers up to and including k + 1?

73
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:20,800
Well this is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus all the way up to k.

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,667
Plus k plus 1.

75
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,933
Right? this is the sum of everything up to and including k plus 1.

76
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,333
Well we are assuming that we know what this already is.

77
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,600
We are assuming that we already have a formula for this.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,133
We are assuming that this is going to simplify to k times k plus 1 over 2.

79
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,000
We are assuming that we know that.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,733
So we will just take this part and we will add it to k plus 1.

81
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:50,190
so we'll add it to k plus 1 over here.

82
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,467
And if you find the common denominator, the common denominator is going to be 2.

83
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,667
So this is going to be equal to...

84
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll write the part in magneta first.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:10,667
so this is k times k plus 1 over 2 plus 2 times k plus 1 over 2.

86
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,533
This thing in blue is the same thing as that thing in blue.

87
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,533
The 2's would cancel out, I'd just wrote it this way so I have a common denominator.

88
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:20,615
So this is going to be equal to...

89
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:25,800
We have a common denominator of 2 and I'll write this in a different colour here.

90
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,400
So we are going to have k times k plus 1 plus 2 times k plus 1.

91
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,867
Now at this step right over here you can factor out a k plus 1.

92
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:39,267
Both of these terms are divisible by k + 1.

93
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:41,000
So let's factor this out.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,400
So if you factor out a k + 1, you get k plus 1 times

95
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,867
refractoring out over here, if you factor out k + 1 you'd just have a k.

96
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:54,252
Over here if you factor out k + 1 you would just have a 2.

97
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:55,225
Let me colour code those.

98
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,800
So you would know what I'm doing.

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:06,667
So this 2 is this 2 right over there and this k is this k right over there.

100
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,533
We factored it out.

101
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:12,533
These k+1's we factored out is this k+1 over there.

102
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:17,267
And it's going to be all of this over 2.

103
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:21,533
Now, we can rewrite this. This is the same thing.

104
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:23,333
This is equal to.

105
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:31,867
This is the same thing as k plus 1, that's this part right over here.

106
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:37,200
Times k plus 1 plus 1.

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Right? This is clearly the same thing as k + 2.

108
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,692
All of that over 2.

109
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:46,141
Why is this interesting to us?

110
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,538
Well we have just proven it.

111
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:56,467
If we assume that this is true and if we use that assumption we get

112
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:05,769
that the sum of all positive integers up to and including k + 1 is equal to k + 1 times k + 1 + 1 over

113
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:06,415
2.

114
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:13,133
We are actually showing that the original formula applies to k+1 as well.

115
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:20,867
If you would take k + 1 and put it in for n you got exactly the result that we got over here.

116
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,200
So we showed , we proved our base case.

117
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,533
This expression worked for the sum for all of positive integers up to and including 1.

118
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:34,867
And it also works if we assume that it works for everything up to k.

119
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:39,533
Or if we assume it works for integer k it also works for the integer k plus 1.

120
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,467
And we are done. That is our proof by induction.

121
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,000
That proves to us that it works for all positive integers.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,400
Why is that?

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,200
We have proven it for 1 and we have proven it that if it works for some integer

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,385
it will work for the next integer.

125
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,477
So if you assume it worked for 1 then it can work for 2.

126
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:03,267
Well we have already proven that it works for 1 so we can assume it works for 1.

127
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,067
So it definetly will work for 2.

128
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,800
So we get 2 checked.

129
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,333
But since we can assume it works for 2 we can now assume it works for 3.

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,000
Well if it works for 3 well then we have proven it works for 4.

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,600
You see how this induction step is kinda like a domino,

132
00:09:16,600 --> 99:59:59,999
it cascades and we can go on and on forever so it works for all positive integers.
