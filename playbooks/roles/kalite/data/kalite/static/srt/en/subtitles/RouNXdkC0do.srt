1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,020
In the last video we learned
a little bit about what an

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,510
income statement would look
like for a very kind of

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,820
vanilla company that
sells widgets.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,730
And in this video what I want
to do is close the loop and

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,780
see how this relates to what we
talked about in the first

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,370
video, in terms of
price per share.

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,630
And we'll talk about earnings
per share in this case.

9
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,160
And then also how the income
statement relates to the

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,700
balance sheet.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,350
And I said I would do it in
the last video, but then I

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,020
realized I was running
out of time.

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,580
And just as a bit of a quick
review, and you probably just

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,370
watched that video.

15
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,430
But just in case you didn't,
revenue was literally the

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,230
widgets that I sold.

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,620
Let's say this was for 2008.

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,110
I sold $3 million worth
of widgets.

19
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,410
Cost of goods sold, well that's
just the cost of the

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,190
goods sold.

21
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,090
So let's say I sold 3 million
widgets for $1.

22
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,970
To produce those 3 million
widgets for $1, it cost me

23
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,690
maybe $0.30 a widget,
or $0.33 a widget.

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,590
And so I had a total expense or
total cost of goods sold of

25
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,710
$1 million.

26
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,640
And so the profit from just
selling those-- say in that

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,470
case that I just made up-- $3
million worth of widgets was

28
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,670
$2 million.

29
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,730
But I have other expenses.

30
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,060
I can't just put that
in my pocket.

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,730
I had marketing, sales, general
and administrative.

32
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,250
And then I was left
with $1 million.

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,370
And that's how much operating
profit my

34
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,180
widget company has produced.

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,260
But I'm not done yet.

36
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,020
We learned in the last
video I didn't

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,340
own the company outright.

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,290
I had some debt.

39
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,620
In this case, $5 million
worth of debt.

40
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,770
So I have to pay some interest.
There was 10%

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,950
interest. So you take
the interest out.

42
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,340
You're left with $500,000
of pre-tax income.

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,720
And of course you have to
pay the government.

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
And we can debate on whether
we're paying them too much or

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,320
too little.

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,100
But they're providing me defense
so that other foreign

47
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,260
countries can't come and
bomb my factories.

48
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,550
And they're providing,
hopefully, an educated

49
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,510
workforce for me.

50
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,250
And nice roads and
infrastructure and

51
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,810
electricity.

52
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,330
So who knows?

53
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,590
So that's what I'm paying
for, arguably.

54
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,890
And so I'm left with net
income of $350,000.

55
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,190
And when people talk about
earnings of a company, this is

56
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,370
what they're talking about.

57
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,000
Net income is also earnings.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,250
   

59
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,450
So when someone says, Google
made $4 billion this past

60
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,900
quarter-- and quarter just means
a quarter of a year, a

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
three month period.

62
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,760
And they normally are literally
March, June,

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,510
September and December.

64
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,240
So every fourth of the year.

65
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,960
They're literally saying,
Google made $3

66
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,825
billion in net income.

67
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:29,670
   

68
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,000
We talked in the first video
when we started this series

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,670
about how different
companies have

70
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,740
different numbers of shares.

71
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,700
So let's make up a number of
shares for this company.

72
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,930
So let's say this company has--
let me do it in mauve--

73
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,090
so this company's shares,
let's say it

74
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,845
has 1 million shares.

75
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:55,530
   

76
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,460
So you've probably heard not
only the term earnings, you've

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,260
probably also heard the term
earnings per share.

78
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,890
So what they do is they just
take your earnings number and

79
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,860
you divide by the number
of shares.

80
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,870
And you have earnings
per share.

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,810
Or EPS.

82
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,230
Sometime people just say EPS for
this company in 2008 was,

83
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,670
and in this case you take
$350,000, your total earnings,

84
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,630
divided by the total number
of shares you

85
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,940
have. And that's what?

86
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:33,800
That's $0.35 per share of EPS.

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Before I go into price to
earnings and all that, I want

88
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,450
to connect the dots between the
income statement and the

89
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,090
balance sheet.

90
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,760
So in this period,
I made $350,000.

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,300
So the way you can think about
what an income statement is,

92
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,390
is it tells you what
happens between

93
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,100
balance sheet snapshots.

94
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:05,660
So let's say on 12/31/2007,
the balance sheet for the

95
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,215
company would have
looked like this.

96
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:08,470
Let me just draw it.

97
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,850
I won't use the square tool.

98
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,374
So it had $10 million
of assets.

99
00:04:16,374 --> 00:04:19,790
   

100
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,140
It had $5 million of debt.

101
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,140
You can kind of view this as the
liabilities of which debt

102
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,750
is one of them.

103
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,620
Let's just say it's all of it.

104
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,960
So $5 million of liabilities.

105
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,990
So the shareholders' equity,
or you could almost say the

106
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,600
book value of the equity of the
company, is $5 million.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,060
$5 million equity.

108
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,200
   

109
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,080
And just to kind of tie it a
little bit with what we did in

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,930
the first video, if we have a
million shares, the book value

111
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,330
of the equity is $5 million,
so if we say the book value

112
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,020
per share is just going to be
this number divided by the

113
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,690
million shares I have. So
$5 million divided by

114
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,710
1 million is $5.

115
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,640
This is the book value
for a share.

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,430
Remember, there's a difference
between book

117
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,080
value and market value.

118
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,330
The stock of this company at
12/31/2007, it could have been

119
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,700
trading at $10, at $7, at $1.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,410
That would have been the
market value per share.

121
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,500
This is the book value.

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,770
And the book value is
essentially saying, OK, if you

123
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,700
take the book value of the
assets-- and I talked about

124
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,670
this a little bit in the last
video-- but if you say, oh,

125
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,590
well we paid $10 million, and
this is how much value there.

126
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,890
And I'll go into more detail
into how you value

127
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,750
these types of things.

128
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,190
And you take out the
liabilities, this is what the

129
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,280
assets are worth according
to the accountants.

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,270
The market value could
be very different.

131
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,790
But fair enough.

132
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,620
I don't want to delve
too much into that.

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,430
But now, over this period of
time, over 2008, 2008 happens.

134
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,030
So the rest of 2008 happens.

135
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,270
And we're left at the end of,
let's say 1/1/2009, or we

136
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,200
could say 12/31/2008.

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,190
It doesn't matter.

138
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:10,885
Give or take a day.

139
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,210
It's a holiday anyway.

140
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,930
We have a new balance sheet.

141
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,330
But what happened here?

142
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,760
Over the course of the year,
we earned some money.

143
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,620
And I won't go too complicated
into cash and accrual

144
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,310
accounting and all
that right now.

145
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,420
We will get into that
eventually.

146
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,750
But I just want to give you the
gist of what's happening.

147
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,550
Is that we made $350,000
in this year.

148
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,410
So our assets will have
increased by $350,000.

149
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,340
It could have increased
by $350,000 of cash.

150
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,310
It might have been increased
by just other people saying

151
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,160
they owe us $350,000.

152
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,740
Those are accounts
receivables.

153
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,790
I'll make a whole video,
probably a whole series of

154
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,080
videos, on accounts
receivables.

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,790
It's an asset that says, someone
owes me that money.

156
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,930
But any way you think about
it, our assets will have

157
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,130
increased by this amount
of money over the

158
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,350
course of the year.

159
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,590
So now, our new balance
sheet at the end of

160
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,595
2008-- so 2008 happened.

161
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,020
Let me draw 2008.

162
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,240
2008 happens.

163
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,700
At the end of which, our assets
would have grown a

164
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,860
little bit.

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:27,130
Our assets are now
at $10,350,000.

166
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,700
So I'll put this in thousands.

167
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,080
This is $10,350 thousands.

168
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,000
So that's the same thing
as $10.35 million.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,610
And let's see.

170
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,400
All we did was, we paid
the interest on the

171
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,440
debt in this example.

172
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
We just paid interest. And
just so you know, most

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,240
corporate debt actually
works that way.

174
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,725
We'll talk later about
amortization schedules and how

175
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:46,650
can you pay down the debt.

176
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,710
But unlike mortgages, a lot of
corporate debt, they just pay

177
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,930
the interest. So we still have
the same amount of debt.

178
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,330
We didn't pay down any of the
principal of the debt.

179
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,930
So we still have $5
million of debt.

180
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,650
And what's left over
for the equity?

181
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,680
Well all of our earnings,
since our

182
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,100
debt stayed the same.

183
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,000
All of our earnings actually
fall down straight to equity.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,780
So we have $5,350,000
of equity.

185
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,080
So the way I think about it,
and probably the way you

186
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,600
should think about it, is the
earnings of a company-- in

187
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,150
this case, we have $350,000
for the year,

188
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,500
or $0.35 per share.

189
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,200
They essentially tell you what
happened from one balance

190
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,690
sheet to another.

191
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,380
So the amount that this number
grows by, the amount that our

192
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,240
equity grows by, is earnings.

193
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,655
So this is $350,000
of earnings.

194
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:50,460
   

195
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,010
And there's something I might
want to touch on.

196
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,630
Because in the last video I
talked a little bit about

197
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,400
return on asset, where we just
took the operating profit, and

198
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,750
we divide that by the assets.

199
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,150
We had a 10% return on assets.

200
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,880
And you might say, oh, well why
shouldn't the assets grow

201
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,760
by that amount?

202
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,080
And the reason they didn't grow
by that amount is because

203
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,300
we actually ended up having to
pay taxes on some of that.

204
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,970
Even if we had no debt, we would
still have to pay taxes.

205
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,480
This line would have
disappeared.

206
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,370
So sometimes when people talk
about return on asset-- which

207
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,530
I did in that last video-- it
might be interesting to say,

208
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,280
is that the pre-tax or the
post-tax return on asset.

209
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,650
In this example that I did in
the previous video, it was the

210
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,140
pre-tax return on asset.

211
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,390
But fair enough.

212
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,440
   

213
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,750
Balance sheets are just
snapshots in time.

214
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,290
They're kind of like
your bank account.

215
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,820
How much are you worth
at any one moment?

216
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,710
And income statements tell you
how do you get from one

217
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,200
balance sheet to the
next balance sheet?

218
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,190
And we'll learn later the cash
flow statement essentially

219
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,680
reconciles the income statement
with what happens

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,350
with your actual cash account,
or how things actually move

221
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,440
within the balance sheet.

222
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,470
And we'll do that later on.

223
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,910
But anyway, we started off in
this video talking about oh,

224
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,930
what's cheap?

225
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,650
What's expensive?

226
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,400
So the question is, how do you
determine that if you can't

227
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,180
just go by the actual dollar
price of-- my baby is crying.

228
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,320
I should probably run to that.

229
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,010
Let me do that right now.

230
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,350
I realize I'm already
at 10 minutes.

231
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,250
I'll see you in the
next video.

232
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,900
