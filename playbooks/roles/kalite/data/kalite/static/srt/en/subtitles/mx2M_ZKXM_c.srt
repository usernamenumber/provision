1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,461
Let's say I'm over here I'm going to do two scenarios.

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:07,007
I'm an observer over here, this is me.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,667
And then, even better, maybe I should just draw my eyeball.

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,133
Because we're going to be observing light.

5
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,627
So I'm just going to draw my eyeball. This is me in

6
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:18,400
the first scenario, and this is one of my eyeballs.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,636
And this is one of my eyeballs in the second scenario.

8
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:27,051
Now in the first scenario, (let me draw it), so in both scenarios we are going to have an object.

9
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:31,788
We're going to have some type of source of light

10
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:35,800
But in the first scenario (relative to me), the source of light

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,300
will not be moving. While in the second scenario

12
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:42,980
the source of light, just for the sake of discussion,

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,977
just for fun, will be moving at half the speed of light.

14
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:49,630
Unimaginably fast speed, but let's just assume that it is.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,849
So it has a velocity of one half the speed of light...

16
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:58,200
One half light speed, away from me.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:05,133
Away from me, who is the observer.

18
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,979
Now let's just imagine what would happen. They're both emitting

19
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,067
light. And they're both going to start emitting

20
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:13,050
light at the exact same time. And when they

21
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,533
start emitting light, they are both the exact same

22
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:20,200
distance from my eye. The only difference is that

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,867
this is stationary relative to me,

24
00:01:22,867 --> 00:01:24,846
while this is moving away from me at

25
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,933
Half the speed of light.

26
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:31,463
So lets say after some period of time, that light wave

27
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:35,533
from this source reaches my eye,

28
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,035
and it looks something like this, I'll try my best

29
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:43,200
to draw it. I'm going to draw a couple of wavelengths

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,133
here, here's half a wavelength, that's a full wavelength

31
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,344
that's another half, a full wavelength, another half,

32
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:54,444
full wavelength, and then a half, and then a full

33
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:55,298
wavelength. So let me see if I can draw that.

34
00:01:55,298 --> 00:02:03,067
So it would look like: full wavelength, full wavelength

35
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:05,922
full wavelength, (this is not easy to do), and then

36
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:11,866
you've got something like that, in the actual waveform.

37
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:16,078
The front of the waveform is just getting to my eye

38
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:20,272
then as the wave forms keep going past my eye

39
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:23,013
my eye will perceive some type of a wavelength

40
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:25,467
or frequency, and perceive it to be some type of color

41
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,516
assuming that we are in some visible part

42
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:29,095
of the Electromagnetic Spectrum.

43
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:31,000
Now think about what's going to happen with this

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,818
source. First thing is, that the front of the

45
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,922
waveform is going to reach me at the exact

46
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:39,081
same time. One of the amazing things

47
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:43,400
about light traveling, in general or especially in a vacuum,

48
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,052
is that it doesn't matter that this is moving away

49
00:02:47,052 --> 00:02:49,784
from me at half the speed of light. The light will still

50
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:52,600
move towards me at the speed of light.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,744
It's absolute, it doesn't matter if this is going away at 0.9

52
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:59,011
the speed of light. The light will still travel

53
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,667
to me at the speed of light.

54
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,600
It's very un-intuitive because in our every day sense

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,853
if I'm moving away from you at half the speed of

56
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,982
a bullet, and I shoot a bullet, the bullet will only move

57
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:13,980
towards you (half of its velocity will be subtracted) at half

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,642
of it's normal velocity relative to whether it was stationary. That is not the case with light.

59
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's think about what the waveform would look like.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,409
So by the time the light reached here, actually let

61
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:37,478
me redraw this over here... redraw this eyeball...

62
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,533
This is me again. So by the time the light

63
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:47,463
reaches my eye, this guy has traveled half this distance.

64
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:52,060
If it took light a certain amount of time to get this far,

65
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,415
this guy will get half as far in the same amount

66
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:56,923
of time. So by the time the light reaches my eye,

67
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,977
this guy will have traveled about half that distance.

68
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,392
So he would have traveled about.. that far.

69
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,364
But they started emitting light at the same time.

70
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:10,400
So that very first photon (if you view light as a particle)

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,972
will reach my eye at the very same time as the very first

72
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,395
photon from this guy.

73
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:19,646
So the wave form is going to essentially be stretched.

74
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:27,726
So we are still going to have, one, two, three, four

75
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,048
full wavelengths, but they'll now be stretched.

76
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,299
So let me see if I can draw four full wavelengths.

77
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:38,361
Half over here, let me cut each of those in half,

78
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,451
so each of these are going to be a full wavelength

79
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:47,000
and then they're going to have a half wavelength, in between.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,067
And so the waveform is going to look like this...

81
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,658
I'll try my best to draw it... this the hardest part

82
00:04:56,658 --> 00:05:00,466
of drawing the stretched out waveform.

83
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,400
And there you go, it's going to look like this.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,932
And so when it get's to my eye, my eye will perceive it

85
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,454
as having a longer wavelength. Even though from the

86
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:12,200
perspective of each of these objects, if you with each of them,

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,791
the frequency and the wavelength of the light emitted

88
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,131
is the same. The only difference is, this guy

89
00:05:18,147 --> 00:05:20,575
is moving away from me, or I'm moving away from it,

90
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,897
depending on how you want to view it, while I am stationary,

91
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:25,932
or it is stationary, where in this first case, the observer

92
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,864
and the object are both stationary. Now in this situation,

93
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:31,186
what's my eye going to say? Well my eye will get

94
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:34,452
each of these successive pulses, or each of these successive

95
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:37,595
wave trains, and will say, "Hey, there's a longer perceived

96
00:05:37,595 --> 00:06:00,948
wavelength here, and also a perceived lower frequency."

97
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,316
So what would that do to the perception of the light?

98
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:06,736
Let's say that this is green light. If we are stationary

99
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:10,056
with the observer it would be green light.

100
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:13,733
So let's look at the electromagnetic spectrum. (I got this from Wikipedia)

101
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,301
So if I was stationary to the observer, we would

102
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,598
be in the green light part of the spectrum. So a

103
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:26,310
500nm wavelength. But if all of a sudden, because the object

104
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,329
is moving away from me at this huge velocity, the

105
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,298
perceived wavelength becomes wider. So from my perception it's

106
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:37,067
going to have a wider wavelength. And you can see

107
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,732
what's happening, it will look redder. It will move

108
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,075
towards the red part of the spectrum. And this

109
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:46,326
phenomenon is called Red Shift.

110
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:54,081
This is RED SHIFT.

111
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,333
And I have done a bunch of videos in the physics playlist

112
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,800
on the Doppler Effect, and over there I talk about sound

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,373
waves, and the perceived frequency of sound as something

114
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,741
travels towards you versus away from you.

115
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:06,713
That's the exact same idea. This is the Doppler Effect applied

116
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:10,382
to light. And the reason why the Doppler Effect works for light

117
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:14,654
traveling through space, AND for sound traveling through

118
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:18,000
air, is because a sound wave in air, regardless of whether

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
the source is moving away or towards you,

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,921
the sound wave is going to be moving at the speed

121
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:25,661
of sound in air at a certain pressure and all of that.

122
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:32,552
And light is the same thing! But in a vacuum, regardless

123
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:35,738
of what the source is doing, the actual light wave

124
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:39,732
itself will always travel at the same velocity. The only

125
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,983
difference is that it's perceived frequency and wavelength

126
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,655
will change. And now the whole reason

127
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,467
why I'm talking about this, is you can use this

128
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:51,295
property of light (that it gets Red Shift), to see whether

129
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,732
things are traveling away or towards you!

130
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,379
And people talk about Red Shift because frankly

131
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,330
because most things are traveling away from us, and that

132
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,400
is one of the reasons we tend to believe in the Big Bang.

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,577
The opposite, if something is traveling towards me at

134
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:08,733
super high velocities, then we would have something called

135
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:16,067
violet shift. So the frequency would increase, and it would look

136
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,045
more blue or purple. Now the other thing I want to highlight

137
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:22,467
is this Red Shift phenomenon, this idea, it doesn't apply

138
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:26,079
only to visible light. So it could even apply to things

139
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,376
that we can't even see. So it would become redder,

140
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,070
(but it's not like you could even see it), it could even be

141
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,577
applied to things even more red then red!

142
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:37,333
So maybe it's a microwave that is being emitted but because

143
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,568
the source is moving away from us so fast, it can be

144
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:45,073
perceived as an actual radio-wave.

145
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,904
And actually (I should have talked about this in the video

146
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,251
on the microwave background radiation) is that we're

147
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:54,848
perceiving it as microwaves, but the sources were moving

148
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:57,588
away from us. They were being Red Shift. So they were

149
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:01,675
not actually emitting microwave radiation. Just what WE

150
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:05,251
observe, (this would be predicted by the Big Bang) is actual

151
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,245
microwave radiation. So anyway, hopefully that gives you a

152
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:13,192
sense of what Red Shift is, and now we can use this tool

153
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:18,904
to explain why we think many many things are moving away

154
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:23,000
from us. And now let me just make sure you get that idea.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,592
If I have two objects, let's say that these are both suns,

156
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:31,397
(or both galaxies, either way) and because of other

157
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:33,579
properties, (and I won't talk about them right now) they are

158
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:41,933
probably emitting light of the same color. Because we know

159
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:45,329
other properties of that star, or galaxy.

160
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,267
Now if what we actually perceive is that this one looks

161
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:53,270
redder to us, than this one, then we know that it is traveling

162
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,264
away from us. And the redder it looks, the more it's wavelength

163
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,654
is spread out, relative to this other star, the faster we know

164
00:10:00,654 --> 99:59:59,999
it is moving away from us.
