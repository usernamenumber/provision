1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's explore what happens to
determinants when you multiply

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,675
them by a scalar.

4
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:08,210
So let's say we wanted to find
the determinant of this

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,730
matrix, of a, b, c, d.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,820
By definition the determinant
here is going to be equal to a

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,360
times d minus b times c, or
c times b, either way.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,810
ad minus bc.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,830
That's the determinant
right there.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,290
Now what if we were
to multiply one of

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,590
these rows by a scalar.

12
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,940
Let's say we multiply it by k.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,880
So we have the situation a, b.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Let's multiply the second
row times k.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,870
So we kc and kd.

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,350
Now what's the determinant
going to look like?

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,840
We're going to have a times
kd, or we could just write

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,410
that as kad, minus kc times b,
or we could write that as kbc.

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,000
If we factor out the k,
we get that equals k

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,690
times ad minus bc.

21
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,000
Now you immediately see that
this thing is the same thing

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,100
as this thing.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,930
So this is equal to k times the
determinant of a, b, c, d.

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,910
So when you just multiply a
row by a scalar-- just one

25
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,470
row, not the entire matrix--
when you just multiply a row

26
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,770
by some scalar, the resulting
determinant will be the

27
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,550
original determinant
times that scalar.

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,880
Now you might say well what
happens if I multiply the

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,580
whole matrix times
that scalar.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,040
Well that's equivalent to
multiplying by a scalar twice.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,120
Let's say I have the matrix A,
and the matrix A is equal to

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,830
a, b, c, d.

33
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:43,190
If I were to think about the
matrix kA, now I'm not just

34
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,270
multiplying one row.

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,210
I'm multiplying the whole
matrix by a scalar.

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:55,500
This is going to be equal
to ka, kb, kc, and kd.

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,180
When you figure out its
determinant, the determinant

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,040
of k times A is going to be
equal to the determinant of

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:13,880
ka, kb, kc, and kd.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,020
Here you're immediately going
to end up with k squared

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,790
terms. You're going to have
k squared times ad.

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:25,770
It's going to be equal to k
squared ad minus k squared bc,

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:34,030
or k squared times ad minus
bc, or k squared times the

44
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,080
determinant of just A.

45
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
So you have to be
very careful.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,990
This is only for a
two by two case.

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,140
You'll find out if this was an
n by n matrix that this would

48
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,190
have been k to the n.

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,600
So the take away is the only way
you can say that this is

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,430
going to be some scalar multiple
times your original

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,890
determinant, is only if you
multiply one row times that

52
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,810
scalar multiple, not
the whole matrix.

53
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,030
Let's see how this extends
to maybe a 3 by 3 case.

54
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,700
   

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,370
You might say, hey Sal, you just
picked the second row.

56
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,800
Does it work with
the first row?

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,140
I'll leave that for you to
determine, but it does.

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,940
It does work.

59
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,500
It doesn't matter which row
I multiplied it by.

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,450
Let's take the three
by three case.

61
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,600
Let's say we have some matrix.

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,020
Let's call this A again.

63
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm redefining A.

64
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,300
It's going to be a, b,
c, d, e, f, g, h, i.

65
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,370
Then if you take its
determinant, the determinant

66
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,100
of A is going to be equal to--
we can do it a couple of

67
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,560
different ways.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,870
But I'll just pick some
arbitrary row.

69
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,670
Because that's the row that
we're going to multiply by

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,410
some scalar.

71
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,260
So let's just take that
row right there.

72
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,920
   

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,590
Remember the plus
minus pattern.

74
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,540
Remember plus, minus, plus,
minus, plus, minus, plus,

75
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,630
minus, plus, that little
checkerboard pattern.

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,590
So d is a minus right there.

77
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,910
So it's going to be equal to
minus d times the determinant

78
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,500
of its submatrix.

79
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,340
So you cross out that
column in that row.

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,020
It's b, c, h, i.

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,230
   

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,986
It's going to be plus e times
its submatrix a, c, g, i.

83
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:19,810
   

84
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,030
It's going to be minus f times--
you get rid of that

85
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,970
row in that column--
d, e, g, h, the

86
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,920
determinant of d, e, g, h.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,230
That's the determinant
of this matrix A.

88
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,340
Now what if we define some
new matrix here?

89
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,450
Let's call it A prime.

90
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,180
Let me make this scroll
down a little bit.

91
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,720
Let me define A prime
right here.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,010
A prime, I'm just going to
multiply this row by a scalar.

93
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:52,590
So it's going to be equal to
a, b, c, kd, ke, and kf.

94
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm not multiplying the whole
matrix times the scalar.

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,540
I can't say this is kA.

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
I'm just multiplying
one of its rows.

97
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,960
Then I have g, h, and i.

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,400
So what's the determinant
of A prime going to be?

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,340
I put that prime there.

100
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,650
So it's different than A,
but it's derived from A.

101
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,380
I just multiplied one row
of A times the scalar.

102
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,810
Well I can go along that same
row that I did up here.

103
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,580
I can go along that same row.

104
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,230
The only difference is is that
instead of having a d,

105
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,530
I now have a kd.

106
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,870
Instead of an e, I
now have a ke.

107
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,990
So instead of a d, I'm going
to have a kd there.

108
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,300
Instead of an e, I'm going
to have an ke there.

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,260
So it's going to be this exact
same thing, but I can replace

110
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,160
this guy, this guy, and this guy
with them multiplied by k.

111
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,070
So it's going to be equal to
minus kd times the determinant

112
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,650
of the submatrix b, c, h, i--
I'm not even look over here

113
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,420
because it's going to be the
same thing as that one up

114
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:55,060
there-- plus ke times the
determinant of a, c, g, i,

115
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,360
minus kf times the determinant
of d, e, g, h.

116
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
What is this equal to?

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,980
This is equal to, if you just
factor out the k, it's equal

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,220
to k times this.

119
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,680
So it's equal to k times
the determinant of A.

120
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,150
So our result also worked
for three by three case.

121
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,650
I just happened to pick
the middle row.

122
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,780
But I encourage you
to pick other rows

123
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,030
and to see what happens.

124
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,470
So let's actually do it
for the general case.

125
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,240
Because I've just been giving
you particular examples, and I

126
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,500
like to show you the general
proof when the general proof

127
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,920
isn't too harry.

128
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,410
So let's say I have
an n by n matrix.

129
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,670
Let's say that I
have matrix A.

130
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:37,530
Let's say that A is n by n.

131
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,940
You can write it like this.

132
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,090
This is the first row.

133
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,140
This is the first column a11,
a12, all the way to a1n.

134
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm going to pick some arbitrary
row here that I'm

135
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,640
going to end up multiplying
by a scalar.

136
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,550
So we can go down here.

137
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:03,300
Let's say row ai, so this is
ai1, ai2, all the way to ain.

138
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,610
This is some row that I'm going
to use to determine the

139
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,060
determinant.

140
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,600
Remember we can go to any row
to get the determinant.

141
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,180
Then finally you keep going.

142
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:18,860
You get an1, an2, all
the way to ann.

143
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
This is as general as you can
get for an n by n matrix.

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,000
Now let's figure out its
determinant, so the

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,650
determinant of A.

146
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm just going to go down
this row right there.

147
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,560
So the determinant of
A is equal to what?

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,750
Well we have to remember the
checkerboard pattern.

149
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,170
We don't know where we are on
the checkerboard pattern

150
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,110
because I just picked an
arbitrary general row here.

151
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,290
But we can use the general
formula that the sign is going

152
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,270
to be determined by negative 1
to the i-- I don't know if i

153
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,390
is even or odd-- so it's
going to be i plus

154
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,110
for this term 1 power.

155
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,920
That's it's sign.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,110
This is what gives us the
checkerboard pattern.

157
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,190
Let me make that clear.

158
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,260
It looks complicated, but this
is just a checkerboard.

159
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,510
   

160
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,420
Times this term right there,
so times ai, so the

161
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,720
coefficient, ai1, and then times
this guy's submatrix.

162
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,730
You remember the submatrix.

163
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,700
You get rid of this row, and
this column is going to be

164
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,430
everything that's left over.

165
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,960
So times that submatrix
of ai1.

166
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,539
   

167
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,730
Then it's going to be plus-- we
just keep doing it-- plus

168
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:46,360
negative 1 to the i plus
2 times ai2 times its

169
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,300
submatrix-- all the way, you
just keep going-- plus minus 1

170
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,380
to the i plus n times ai.

171
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,170
You're in the nth column,
and then its submatrix.

172
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,960
This is going to be an n minus
1 by n minus 1 matrix.

173
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,990
All of these are going to be.

174
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,520
Just like that, that's
the determinant of A.

175
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,940
We could actually rewrite
it in sigma notation.

176
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,890
That'll simplify things
a little bit.

177
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:18,720
So the determinant of A, we can
rewrite it as the sum from

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
j is equal to 1 to j-- I'll
write it explicitly here-- j

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:36,800
is equal to n of negative 1 to
the i plus j times aij, and

180
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,440
then each of the submatrices,
Aij.

181
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,740
This thing right here is just
another way of writing this

182
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,990
thing I wrote up there.

183
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,790
I'm just saying the sum.

184
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,500
You just take j equal 1,
put them in there.

185
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,760
You get this term right there.

186
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,830
You take j equal
2, you add it.

187
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,660
You get this term right there.

188
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,380
You keep doing it.

189
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,480
You get j equal n.

190
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,070
You get that term right there.

191
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,800
So these two things
are equivalent.

192
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,520
So what happens I have
some new matrix?

193
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,370
Let me copy and paste
my current matrix.

194
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,210
So let me copy and paste it.

195
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,950
Actually let me copy and
paste everything.

196
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,340
That'll make things
move quickly.

197
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,410
I copied it.

198
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,010
Now let me paste it
just like that.

199
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,940
Let me define a new
matrix A prime.

200
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,420
It's still an n by n matrix.

201
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,240
But that row that I just
happened to use to determine

202
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,500
my determinant, I'm going to
multiply it by a scalar k.

203
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,740
So it's k ai1, k ai2 k
ain just like that.

204
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,580
So what's the determinate
of A prime?

205
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,090
Well we're just going to
go down this row again.

206
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,200
But now instead of just an ai1,
we have a k ai1 Instead

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,970
of an ai2, we have a
k ai2 Instead of an

208
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,530
ain we have a k ain.

209
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,830
So it's determinant is just
going to be this same thing,

210
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,375
but instead of an aij
everywhere, we're going to

211
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,540
have a k aij.

212
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,203
So this is the determinant
of A prime.

213
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:11,710
   

214
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,180
We could just take out this
constant right here.

215
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,100
It has no i's or j's in it.

216
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,310
I has no j's in it in
particular, so we can just

217
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,270
take it out.

218
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,100
So it's equal to k times the sum
from j is equal to 1 to j

219
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:34,080
is equal to n of minus 1 to
the i plus j times aij.

220
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,710
This is the coefficient.

221
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:39,040
This is the submatrix for each
of those coefficients, aij.

222
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,170
That's a matrix right
there, an n minus 1

223
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,310
by n minus 1 matrix.

224
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,550
Then you immediately recognize--
I think you saw

225
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,580
where this was going-- this
right here is just the

226
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,820
determinant of A.

227
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,430
So we get the result that the
determinant of A prime is

228
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,890
equal to k times the
determinant of A.

229
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,535
So we've just shown you in
general, if you have any n by

230
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:10,680
n matrix, if you multiply only
one row, not the whole matrix,

231
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,900
only one row by some scalar
multiple k, the resulting

232
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,440
determinant will be your
original determinant times k.

233
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,060
Now I touched on this in
the original video.

234
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,820
   

235
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,810
What is the determinant
of k times A?

236
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,400
So now we're multiplying
every row times k.

237
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,940
Or another way to think about
is you're multiplying

238
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,500
n rows times k.

239
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,810
So you're doing this n times.

240
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,880
So if you multiply
k times itself n

241
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,930
times, what do you get?

242
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,010
You get k to the n.

243
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,090
So this is going to be equal
to k to the n times the

244
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,560
determinant of A.

245
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,750
If you just do it once,
you get k times the

246
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,460
determinant of A.

247
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,650
Now if you do a second row,
you're going to get k times k

248
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,715
times the determinant of A.

249
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,730
If you do a third row, you're
going to get k to the third

250
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,010
times the determinant of A.

251
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,040
The fourth row, k to the
fourth times the

252
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,900
determinant of A.

253
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,386
If you do them all, all n rows,
you're going to have k

254
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,480
to the n times the
determinant of A.

255
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,140
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting.

256
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,970
I encourage you to experiment
with these other ways.

257
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,390
Try going down a column and
seeing what happens.

258
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:19,419
