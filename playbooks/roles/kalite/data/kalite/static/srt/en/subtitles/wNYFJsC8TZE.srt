1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,672
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:04,412
explore how the floating exchange rate could,

3
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:07,431
in theory, help resolve trading imbalances.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,380
And for this simplified example,

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,649
We are going to assume that

6
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,895
the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the US $

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:17,471
is 6 Yuan per 1 US $.

8
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:19,821
And also for simplification, we are going to assume that

9
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:23,190
China is only exporting one thing to the United States

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,525
and that one thing is microwaves.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,394
And at 6 yuan per $, the Chinese manufacturer

12
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:32,570
is going to sell them in the United States for $50 each.

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,790
And at that price, there is a demand in the US for 1 million microwaves.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,656
I'm also going to assume that

15
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,751
the only export from the US to China is software.

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,434
And they have demand for 2 million units

17
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:49,793
if they sell them at 60 yuan per unit.

18
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:52,668
So let's think about what the demand for the each of the currencies

19
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,082
will be from each of the manufacturers.

20
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,401
So the Chinese manufacturer over a year

21
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,277
is going to sell a million units for $50 each.

22
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:04,470
So he's gonna get $50 million dollars in revenue

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:10,160
And he is going to want to convert that $50 million into yuan.

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,660
So you can kind of view this as a supply.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,600
This right over here is the supply of US dollars.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,688
And we are going to assume that

27
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,398
these are the only people that are creating currencies,

28
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:22,650
because they are the only people trading in this ultra simplified world.

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,614
Now the US manufacturer is going to sell

30
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:28,401
2 million units at 60 yuan each.

31
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:37,650
So that's going to be 120 million yuan of revenue.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,272
And he is going to want to convert this into dollars

33
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:41,854
at the prevailing exchange rate right then

34
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:44,438
which is 6 yuan per dollar.

35
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,725
So he's going to want to convert this.

36
00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:49,190
He divides this by 6.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,224
He's going to want to convert that into 20 million dollars.

38
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:56,653
And obviously, he's going to want to convert into yuan,

39
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,460
because that's where his costs are in, that's where he lives.

40
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,194
This guy wants to convert into dollars,

41
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:03,144
because that's where his costs are.

42
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,361
Now this is the supply of dollars.

43
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:08,685
These dollars wants to be converted into Chinese currency.

44
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,731
This right here is the demand for dollars.

45
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:15,984
This is the amount of $ needed by a guy converting from yuan.

46
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:17,790
Now clearly, there is an imbalance.

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,060
The supply of $ is much larger than the demand for $ in this situation.

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,480
And anytime the supply for anything is larger than the demand...

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,600
If the supply is larger than the demand

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,980
then that means the price must go down.

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,310
And we talk about the price of a currency,

52
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,000
in this case, the price of the dollar going down.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,097
We are talking about in terms of yuan.

54
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,450
So the dollar...

55
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,650
...the dollar will go down.

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,466
The price goes down which means the yuan goes up.

57
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:52,460
The dollar will become weaker.

58
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,779
The yuan will become stronger.

59
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:56,208
Now, if that happens,

60
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,791
what happens to the prices over here?

61
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:01,099
If the yuan becomes stronger,

62
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:06,282
we start seeing 4 yuan or 5 yuan per $ or even 3 yuan per $.

63
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,945
Then this Chinese manufacturer

64
00:03:07,945 --> 00:03:11,063
won't be able to afford to sell at only $50.

65
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:13,322
He is going to have to raise the price

66
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:16,154
in order to cover his costs in Chinese currency.

67
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,370
If he raises the price, he's going to lower the demand.

68
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,166
On the other side of the equation, the American manufacturer,

69
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,850
in order to get the same number of dollars,

70
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,112
he actually can sell it for fewer yuan.

71
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:29,650
Now he needs fewer yuan per each dollar.

72
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,894
So he can actually lower the price in China.

73
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,722
And if he lowers the price in China,

74
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:36,383
that's going to increase the demand.

75
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,460
So what you have happening is

76
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,250
because yuan would become stronger,

77
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,126
if you had a floating exchange rate,

78
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:44,603
the demand for Chinese goods would go down

79
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:46,969
and the demand for the US goods would go up.

80
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:52,810
And eventually, you would have this trade and currency imbalance resolve itself.

81
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,315
Now, this is all theoretical,

82
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:57,843
and reality is that it's not allowed to float.

83
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,972
We'll describe that more in future videos.

84
00:04:00,972 --> 00:04:05,435
