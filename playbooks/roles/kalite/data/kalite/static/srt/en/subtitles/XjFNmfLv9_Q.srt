1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,380
I've taken this problem from
Chapter 4 of the Chemistry &

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,520
Chemical Reactivity book by
Kotz, Treichel and Townsend,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,000
and I've done it with
their permission.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,070
So let's do this example.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:20,190
A 1.034 gram sample of impure
oxalic acid is dissolved in

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,440
water and an acid-base
indicator added.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,860
The sample requires 34.47
milliliters of 0.485 molar

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,260
sodium hydroxide to reach
the equivalence point.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,960
What is the mass of oxalic acid,
and what is its mass

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,500
percent in the sample?

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,520
So before we even break into the
math of this, let's just

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
think about what's happening.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,370
We have some oxalic acid,
which looks like this.

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,930
It's really two carbolic acid
groups joined together, if

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,290
that means anything to you.

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,510
Watch the organic chemistry play
list if you want to learn

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,800
more about that.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,120
So we have a double bond to one
oxygen, and then another

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,260
bond to a hydroxide.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,250
We have that on the other
carbon as well.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,840
   

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,240
This right here is what
oxalic acid is.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,040
And it's an interesting acid,
because it can actually donate

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,900
two protons.

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,550
This proton can be nabbed off,
and this proton can also be

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,150
contributed.

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,445
And it's actually resident
stabalized.

29
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:22,580
If that doesn't mean anything
to you, don't worry.

30
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,500
You'll learn more about that
in organic chemistry.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,700
But the important thing to
realize here is that there's

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,000
two protons to nab off of it.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,410
   

34
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:38,410
Now each molecule of sodium
hydroxide-- remember when you

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,060
put it in the water it really
just dissolves, and you can

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,140
really just think of it as
hydroxide-- each molecule of

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,400
hydroxide can nab one of
the hydrogen protons.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,490
So for every one molecule of
oxalic acid, you're going to

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,950
need two hydroxides-- one to nab
this hydrogen proton, and

40
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,260
then another one to nab
that hydrogen proton.

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,000
So let's write down the balanced
equation that we're

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
dealing with here.

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,690
So we're going to start off
with some oxalic acid.

44
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,270
So that has two hydrogens-- so
it's H2-- two carbons, and

45
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,270
then four oxygens-- O4.

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,520
It's dissolved in water, so
it's an aqueous solution.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,360
And to that, we're going to
add sodium hydroxide.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,950
   

49
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,370
Now I just told you that you're
going to need two of

50
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,790
the hydroxides to fully
neutralize the oxalic acid.

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,200
So you're going to
need two of them.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,360
And this is also in our
aqueous solution.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,650
And once the reaction happens,
this guy will have lost both

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,570
of the hydrogen protons,
so let me draw that.

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,810
So it will look like this.

56
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,220
No more hydrogen,
so it's C2O4.

57
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,340
It'll have a negative
2 charge.

58
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,280
And actually, you could imagine
that it might be

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,100
attracted to these positively
charged sodiums. And 2 sodiums

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,760
in particular.

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,400
So this has a negative
2 charge.

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,920
We could even write it there
if you want-- 2 minus.

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,230
And then you could have
the sodiums over here.

64
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,790
You have these two sodiums
that have two plus.

65
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,060
And this entire molecules
becomes neutral.

66
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,180
They are attracted
to each other.

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,650
They are still in an
aqueous solution.

68
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,130
And then, the hydroxide nabs the
protons, and then you are

69
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,800
left with just water.

70
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,130
So plus 2 moles-- or 2 molecules
depending on how

71
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:42,200
we're viewing this--
plus two waters.

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,990
I'll just use that same
orange color.

73
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,270
Plus two H2Os.

74
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:52,860
One of the hydrogens in each
of the water molecules are

75
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,030
coming from the oxalic acid, and
so two of these hydrogens

76
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,910
in these two moles of the water
are coming from one

77
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,820
entire molecule of
oxalic acid.

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,550
Now let's actually
do the math.

79
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,610
We have 34.47 milliliters of
the solution that has the

80
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,460
sodium hydroxide.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,560
And I'm just going to convert
that to liters just so it's

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,630
easier to deal with the molarity
right over there.

83
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:26,810
So we have 34.47 milliliters--
we could write it of the

84
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,950
solution, but we understand
that, that's the case.

85
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:37,290
So let's just So this is times,
we have one liter for

86
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,570
every 1,000 milliliters.

87
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,300
And then this will give us-- the
milliliters cancel out--

88
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:57,890
34.47 divided by 1,000 is
0.03447 liters of this 0.485

89
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,700
molar sodium hydroxide
solution.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,410
So let's figure out how many
actual molecules of sodium

91
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,000
hydroxide we have. This
is the solution.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,940
And we know its concentration,
0.485 molar-- so let me do

93
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,740
that in a different color--
0.485 molar, this information

94
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,460
allows us to figure
out the actual

95
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,590
molecules of sodium hydroxide.

96
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:30,830
So we want to multiply this by--
we have 0.485 moles of

97
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:38,380
sodium hydroxide for every
1 liter of this solution.

98
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,310
That's what the molarity
tells us.

99
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,260
We have 0.485 moles per liter.

100
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,740
So the liters cancel out, and
then now we're going to

101
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,950
actually have to get
a calculator out.

102
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,620
And this'll tell us how many
moles of sodium hydroxide we

103
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,690
have in this solution.

104
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,690
So let me get my calculator.

105
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,980
There we go.

106
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,860
All right, let me just multiply
these two numbers.

107
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:13,580
So we have 0.03447 times 0.485
is equal to-- let me put this

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,080
down here-- 0.167.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,890
And we only have three
significant digits here, so

110
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,190
we're going to round to three
significant digits.

111
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,630
So we'll just go with 0.0167.

112
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:31,250
So let me move that over
off the screen.

113
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:41,570
So this is going to be equal
to 0.0167, and all we have

114
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,050
left here are moles of
sodium hydroxide.

115
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,070
   

116
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,620
Now we know that this many moles
of sodium hydroxide are

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,660
going to completely react with
however many moles of oxalic

118
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,300
acid we have. Now we know that
we need two moles of this for

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,170
every mole of oxalic acid.

120
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,880
Or for every mole of oxalic acid
that completely reacts,

121
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,260
we need two moles of this.

122
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,510
So let's write that down.

123
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,870
   

124
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,680
And then you color.

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,730
So we need two moles of sodium
hydroxide, we got that from

126
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,510
our balanced equation right
there, and it's obvious it

127
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,660
needs one mole, or one molecule
will take this

128
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,080
proton, and then you need
another molecule

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,160
to take that proton.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,180
So we need two moles of sodium
hydroxide for every one mole

131
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,030
of oxalic acid.

132
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,040
For every one mole of H2C2O4.

133
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,770
   

134
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,500
So essentially, we are
just going to divide

135
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,810
this number by 2.

136
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,090
Let me get the calculator
back.

137
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:58,340
So we're just going to divide
0.0167 divided by 2.

138
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,155
Once again, three significant
digits 0.00835.

139
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:12,050
So this is going to 0.00835
moles of oxalic acid, H2C2O4.

140
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,410
   

141
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,010
So we have the number
of moles, but we to

142
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,790
figure out the mass.

143
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,590
And we know the molar
mass of oxalic acid.

144
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,580
Let me write these down.

145
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,195
We know that hydrogen has a
molar mass-- let me write it

146
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:34,490
this way-- molar mass if you
have a mole of hydrogen, it

147
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,460
has a molar mass of one gram.

148
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,370
If you have-- and this comes
from its atomic weight-- if

149
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:49,950
you have carbon its molar mass
is 12 grams. And if you have

150
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:56,510
oxygen, its molar mass
is 16 grams.

151
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,710
So what's the molar mass
of oxalic acid?

152
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,410
Well we have two hydrogens,
so that's going to

153
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,640
be two grams, right?

154
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,830
2 times 1 gram.

155
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,340
That's the hydrogens there.

156
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,630
We have two carbons, so it's
going to be plus 24 grams. 12

157
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,680
grams for each of
these carbons.

158
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,800
And then we're going to have
four oxygens that weigh in, if

159
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,970
we have a mole of them,
at 16 grams. So that's

160
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,850
going to be plus 64.

161
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,960
So what does this come out to?

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,870
24 plus 64 is 88, right?

163
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,200
2 plus 6 is 88, right.

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:40,420
So it's 88 plus 2 more is 90
grams. So if you had a mole of

165
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,970
oxalic acid, it would be 90
grams. So we could say 90

166
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:52,180
grams per mole of H2C2O4.

167
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,430
   

168
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:59,880
So let's go back to
the math here.

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,790
I'll rewrite it over here.

170
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:08,700
We know we're dealing with
0.00835 moles of

171
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,130
oxalic acid, H2C2O4.

172
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,700
   

173
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,010
And now we know its
molar mass.

174
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,160
We know that there are 90
grams-- let me do this in a

175
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,430
different color, this color's
getting motonous-- we know

176
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:30,120
that there are 90 grams
of H2C2O4 for

177
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,680
every one mole of H2C2O4.

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,870
This is its molar mass.

179
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,530
And now we just multiply this
number, and we'll figure out

180
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,790
the grams of oxalic acid.

181
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,200
That and that cancels out.

182
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,380
and.

183
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,490
Then we just take the number
that we had and multiply it by

184
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,860
90, so times 90.

185
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,880
This just says the previous
answer, which is the number of

186
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,510
moles of oxalic acid times its
molar mass will tell us the

187
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,860
grams of oxalic acid.

188
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,910
So we get 0.75.

189
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,750
I'll just round it to
2 since we only have

190
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,000
three significant digits.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,660
   

192
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,860
The 90 isn't exact, so it's a
little bit-- but I'll just

193
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,570
round it to three significant
digits.

194
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,940
So 7--.752.

195
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:27,770
This is equal to 0.752 grams
of oxalic acid: H2C2O4.

196
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,520
And I think we've answered
part of the question.

197
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,390
So the first question is, what
is the mass of oxalic acid?

198
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,800
We've just answered it.

199
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,640
That answer right there
is 0.752 grams.

200
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,980
Now the next part is,
what is its mass

201
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,600
percent in the sample?

202
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Well the sample of impure oxalic
acid right over here,

203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,950
was 1.034 grams. So we just have
to say, what percentage

204
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,060
is 0.752 of 1.034?

205
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,250
So let's get the calculator
back.

206
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:14,580
So we have the 0.752 divided
by 1.034 and we get 72.7%.

207
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,150
So the answer to the
second part right

208
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,220
over there is, 72.7%.

209
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,170
We were able to figure out that
this impure oxalic acid

210
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,990
sample is 72.7% actual
oxalic acid.

211
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,199
