1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,502
To see the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:04,738
I'm going to go through this little example

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,991
and first I'm going to account for things

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:09,090
using a cash basis of accounting

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,390
and then we'll do it with an accrual basis accounting

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,767
and just so you have some context,

7
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,025
the cash basis is:

8
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,409
anytime you get cash from a customer

9
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,754
you would count that as revenue

10
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,808
and anytime you have to spend cash

11
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:21,554
you would count that as an expense

12
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,667
you'll see that this is what most small businesses do

13
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:27,333
while most slightly more sophisticated businesses

14
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,169
would use accrual based accounting,

15
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:31,340
because that matches up, kind of,

16
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,048
your actual expenses and your revenue

17
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:36,849
a little bit better in each period

18
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,072
so let's just go through this example

19
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,249
using the cash basis first.

20
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,685
And we're gonna assume

21
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:43,029
that we start off with no money.

22
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:44,225
So in month one,

23
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:48,565
you cater an event where the cost to you was $100

24
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,236
The customer pays you $200 for your services

25
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,746
And maybe they pay your $200 ahead of time,

26
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:55,771
so that you have the cash to go buy

27
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,573
the food and the paper cups and paper plates or whatever.

28
00:00:58,573 --> 00:00:59,846
So you get $200 in revenue

29
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,541
this is a cash basis of accounting,

30
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:06,875
and you have to spend $100 of that on supplies,

31
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,502
and maybe you have to hire some help,

32
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,708
and pay yourself a salary

33
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,126
so, if you got $200,

34
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:15,975
and you used $100 of that, your profit here,

35
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:18,277
I'll do profit in green as well

36
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,358
your profit is going to be

37
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:22,074
(that's not green)

38
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:25,666
your profit is going to be $100

39
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,448
And if you started with no cash

40
00:01:27,448 --> 00:01:28,732
your cash at the end of period,

41
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:30,283
This is going to be the cash at the end of month one,

42
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:33,646
you will now have $100 of cash.

43
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:35,533
Now let's go to month two

44
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:41,142
You cater an event where the cost to you was $200

45
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,841
You and the customer agree that

46
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,588
they can pay you $400 the next month.

47
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:50,575
So in this month, we have to use $200

48
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:52,409
Maybe our bank lets us overdraft

49
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,877
So let's say, we

50
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:56,478
(I shouldn't write this as an expense),

51
00:01:56,478 --> 00:01:57,332
So I'd have to write negative,

52
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,745
we're assuming this is going out,

53
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,274
I'll write it in red.

54
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:03,627
So, we're going to use $200,

55
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:05,062
But we don't get any revenue

56
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,044
because we're doing the cash basis accounting

57
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,877
The customer's not paying us in that month

58
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,977
They're paying $400 the next month

59
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,843
So we get no revenue that period

60
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:14,362
So it looks like we got no revenue,

61
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:15,877
We had $200 of expenses.

62
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:21,600
Our profit here is going to be negative $200

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,944
and when we look at how much cash,

64
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:26,194
we had $100 of cash entering into month two,

65
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,213
We're using $200 of that,

66
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:31,234
so now we've kind of overdrawn our bank balance.

67
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,800
Maybe we owe our bank now $100

68
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,995
Let's go to month two

69
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,351
Month two, you get $400

70
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,515
from the customer in the previous month

71
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:42,745
You also get $200 in advance

72
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,027
from a customer that you have to cater for next month

73
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:47,746
So we've done no catering this month

74
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:49,027
but we've gotten a lot of money

75
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:51,044
We've got $400 from the previous month's customer,

76
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:53,638
and $200 for a customer

77
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,588
you're going to cater for next month

78
00:02:55,588 --> 00:03:00,211
So we've got $600 on a cash basis in revenue.

79
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:01,677
And we had no expenses in that month.

80
00:03:01,677 --> 00:03:04,860
So we have $600 in profit,

81
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,560
and our cash balance increases by $600,

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,678
so the end of this month we now have $500.

83
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:14,450
Now, month four: You cater the last customer's event.

84
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,798
It costs you $100.

85
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:19,028
So once again, you just have to spend,

86
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:20,910
(I'm gonna do that in magenta)

87
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,479
You just have to spend the $100 in month four

88
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,428
to cater the actual event.

89
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,644
But you got no revenue in that month.

90
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:33,252
So it looks like you took a loss negative $100.

91
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:36,085
And then your cash balance will go down to

92
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:40,929
your cash balance will go down to $400

93
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,367
So this is a cash basis.

94
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:43,701
this is how a lot of businesses run it.

95
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,517
But you can see there's a problem here.

96
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:49,400
It looks like our profit is jumping all over the place.

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,548
Sometimes we're profitable. Sometimes we're not.

98
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:53,396
Sometimes we're profitable. Sometimes we're not.

99
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,996
Even though our business is a little bit steadier

100
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,938
than that would seem to imply.
