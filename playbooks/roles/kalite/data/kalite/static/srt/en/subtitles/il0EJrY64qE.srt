1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,050
What I wanna do in this video is give an introduction to the language

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,990
Or some of the characters that we use when we talk about geometry

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,150
and I guess the best place to start is even think about

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,410
what geometry means

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,520
As you might recognize the first part of geometry right over here

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,440
You have the root word geo

7
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,090
The same word that you see in things like Geography and Geology

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,740
And this comes this refers to the earth

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,360
This refers

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,090
My E looks like a C right over there

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,800
This refers to the earth

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,250
And then you see this Metry part

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,360
And you see Metry in things like Trigonometry as well

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,920
And Metry or the metric system and this comes from measurement

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,110
This comes from measurement or measure

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,420
Measurement

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,120
So when someone's talking about Geometry,

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,290
The word itself comes from earth measurement

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,520
And that's kind of not so bad of a name

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,430
Because it is such of a general subject

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,130
Geometry really is the study and trying to understand

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,750
How shapes and space and things that we see relate to each other

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,750
So you know when you start learning about Geometry,

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,120
You learn about lines and triangles and circles

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,470
And you learn about angles

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,350
And we'll define all of these things more and more precisely

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
As we go further and further on

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,710
But also encapsulated things like patterns

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,680
And three dimensional shapes

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,190
So it's almost everything that we see

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,940
All the Math- visually Mathematical things that we understand

32
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,480
Can in someway be categorized in Geometry

33
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,330
Now with that out of the way, let's just start from the basics

34
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,640
So basic starting point from Geometry

35
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,340
And then we can just grow from there

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,110
So if we just start at a dot

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,130
That dot right over there

38
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,280
It's just a point

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,450
It's just that little point on that screen right over there

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,870
we'd literally call that a point

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,750
And I'd call that a definition

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,950
And the fun thing about Mathematics is

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,270
That you can make definitions

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,710
We could've called this

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,340
We could've called this an armadillo

46
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,180
But we decide to call this a point which I think make sense

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,590
Because it's just what we would call it in everyday language as well

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,530
That is a point

49
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,990
Now what's interesting about a point is that

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,650
it is just a position; that you can't move on a point

51
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,200
If you moved if you were are at this point

52
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,860
And if you moved in any direction at all

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,770
you would no longer be at that point

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,500
So you cannot move on a point

55
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,820
Now there are differences between points

56
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,730
For example that's one point there

57
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,500
Maybe I have another point over here

58
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,690
And then I have another point over here

59
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,460
And then another point over there

60
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,550
And you want to be able to refer to the different points

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,390
And not everyone has the luxury of a nice colored pen like I do

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,510
Otherwise, they could refer to the green point,

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,120
Or the blue point, or the pink point

64
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,010
And so in Geometry to refer to points we tend to give them labels

65
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,850
And the labels tend to have letters

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,530
So for example, this could be point A;

67
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,480
this could be B; this would be point C;

68
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,410
and this right over here could be point D

69
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,200
So if someone says hey circle point C- you know which one to circle

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,640
You know that you would have to circle,

71
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,520
You would have to circle that point right over there

72
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,280
Well that so far it's kind of interesting

73
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,760
You have these things called points

74
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,180
You can't really move around on a point

75
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,800
All they do is specify a position

76
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,950
What if we wanna move around little bit more?

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,040
What if we wanna get from one point to another?

78
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,110
So what if we took

79
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,890
We started at one point and we wanted we wanted all of the points

80
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,410
including that point that connect that point in another point

81
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,860
So all of these points right over here

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,810
So what would we call what would we call this thing?

83
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,570
All of the points that connect A and B along a straight

84
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,160
And I'll use everyday language here

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,240
Along kind of a straight line like this,

86
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,180
Well we'll call this a line segment

87
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,390
In everyday language you might call it a line

88
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,120
But well call it a line segment coz we'll see in ge

89
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,800
When we talk in Mathematical terms

90
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,540
A line means something slightly different

91
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,100
So this is a line segment

92
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,520
And if we were to connect D and C,

93
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,560
This would also be another line segment

94
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,460
A line segment

95
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,840
And once again, because we always don't have the luxury of colors

96
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,060
This one is clearly the orange line segment;

97
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,870
This is clearly the yellow line segment;

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,080
We want to have labels for these line segments

99
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,550
And the best way to label the line segments are with its end points

100
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,980
And that's another word here

101
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,610
so a point is just literally A or B

102
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,930
But A and B are also the end points of these line segments

103
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,120
Coz it starts and ends at A and B

104
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,650
So let me write this A and B

105
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,940
A and B are end points

106
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,220
Another definition right over here

107
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,740
We, once again, we could've called them aardvarks or end armadillos

108
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,450
But we as mathematicians decide to call them end points

109
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,350
Because that seems to be a good name for it

110
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,200
And once again, we need a way to label these line segments

111
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,980
With that have the end points

112
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,250
And what's a better way to label a line segment than

113
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,670
With its actual end points

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,550
So we would refer to this line segment over here-

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760
We would put its end points there

116
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,730
And to show that it's a line segment,

117
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,070
we would draw a line over it just like that

118
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,560
This line segment down here, we would write it like this

119
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,030
And we could've just as easily written it like this:

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,180
CD with a line over it

121
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,820
Would've refer to the same line segment

122
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,930
BA, BA with a line segment with a line over it

123
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,170
would refer to that same line segment

124
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,240
And now you might be saying well I'm not satisfied

125
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,830
Just travelling in between A and B

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,780
And this is actually another interesting idea

127
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,920
When you were just on A, when you were just on a point

128
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,820
And you couldn't travel at all;

129
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,300
you couldn't travel at all in any direction without,

130
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,010
while staying on that point,

131
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,790
That means you have zero options to travel in

132
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,670
You can't go up or down, left or right, in or out of the page

133
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,990
And still be on that point

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,860
And so that's why we say a point has zero dimensions

135
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,450
Zero dimensions

136
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,320
Now all of a sudden, we have this thing: this line segment here

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,190
And this line segment

138
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,230
we can at least go to the left and the right

139
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,300
along this line segment

140
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,910
We can go towards A or towards B

141
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,930
So we can go back or forward in one dimension

142
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,260
So the line segment is a one dimensional

143
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,390
It is a one dimensional idea almost or one dimensional object

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,040
Although these are more kind of abstract ideas

145
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,130
There is no such thing as a perfect line segment

146
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,950
Because everything a line segment you can't move

147
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,280
You can't move up or down on this line segment while being on it

148
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,980
While in reality anything that we think is a line segment

149
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,720
Even you know, a stick of some type-

150
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,690
a very straight stick or a string that is thought

151
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,150
that still will have some width

152
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,480
but the geometrical pure line segment has no width

153
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,380
It only has a length here so you can only move along the line

154
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,360
And that's why we say it's one dimensional

155
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,010
A point you can't move at all;

156
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,080
a line segment you can only move in that back and forth

157
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,410
along that same direction

158
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,620
Now I just said to you that it can actually have a length

159
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,820
How do you refer to that?

160
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,590
Well you refer to that by not writing that line on it

161
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,450
So if I write AB with a line on top of it like that

162
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,800
That means I'm referring to the actually line segment

163
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,420
If I say that

164
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,010
let me do this in a new color

165
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,680
If I say that AB is equal to five units

166
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,690
It might be centimeters or meters whatever

167
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,620
I just the abstract unit is five,

168
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,500
That means that the distance between A and B is five

169
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:19,780
That the length of line segment AB is actually five

170
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,700
Now let's keep on extending it

171
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,790
Let's say we wanna just keep going in one direction

172
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,670
So let's say that I start at A

173
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,030
Let me do this in a new color

174
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,220
Let's say I start at A and I wanna go to D

175
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,360
But I wanna I want the option of keep on

176
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,620
I wanna keep on going

177
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,160
So I can't go further in A's direction than A

178
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,420
But I can go further in D's direction

179
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,480
So this little this idea that I just showed;

180
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,600
This essentially a cycle line segment

181
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,000
But I can keep on going past this end point

182
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,230
we call this We call this a ray

183
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,440
and the starting point for a ray is called the vertex

184
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,240
Not a term that you'll see too often

185
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,340
You'll see vertex later on in other context but it's good to know

186
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,900
This is the vertex of the ray

187
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,780
It's not the vertex of this line segment

188
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,200
So maybe I shouldn't label it just like that

189
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,340
And what's interesting about a ray is

190
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,910
once again its one a dimensional figure

191
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,430
But you could keep on going in one of the direct-

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,630
You can keep on going toward past one of the end points

193
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,040
And the way that we would specify a ray is we would say

194
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,450
We would call it AD and we would put this little arrow over on top of it

195
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,790
To show that is a ray

196
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,600
And in this case it matters the order

197
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,940
That we put the letters in

198
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,950
If I put DA if I put DA as a ray

199
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,340
This would mean a different ray

200
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,050
That would mean we're starting at D and then we're going past A

201
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,440
So this is not ray DA, this is ray AD

202
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,870
Now the last idea that I'm sure you're thinking about is

203
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,410
What if I could keep on going in every, in both directions?

204
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,930
So let's say I can keep going in

205
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,630
My diagram is getting messy

206
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,980
So let's let me introduce some more points

207
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,350
So let's say I have point E and then I have point F right over here

208
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,810
And let's say that I have this object that can

209
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,760
That goes through both E and F

210
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,210
but this keeps on going in both directions

211
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,890
This is, when we talk in geometry terms, this is what we call a line

212
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,380
Now know this a line never ends;

213
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,490
you can keep going in either direction

214
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,380
A line segment does end

215
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,780
It has end points; A line does not

216
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,340
And actually a line segment can sometimes be called just a segment

217
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,290
And so you would specify line EF

218
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,470
you would specify line EF with these arrows just like that

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,840
Now the thing you're gonna see most typically

220
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,770
When we're studying Geometry are these right over here

221
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,200
Because we're gonna be concerned

222
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,400
With sides of shapes, distances between points

223
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,560
And we're talking about any of those things;

224
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,020
Things that have finite length;

225
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,760
things that have an actual length;

226
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,950
Things that don't go off forever in one or two directions,

227
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,940
Then you're talking about a segment or a line segment

228
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,450
Now if we go back to a line segment

229
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,720
just to kind of keep talking about new words-

230
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,180
That you might confront in Geometry

231
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,620
If we go back talking about a line

232
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,040
That's I was drawing a ray

233
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,330
So let's say I have point X and point Y

234
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,050
And so this is line segment XY;

235
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,290
so I could specify it, denote it just like that

236
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,790
If I have another point

237
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
Let's say I have another point right over here

238
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,620
Let's call that point Z

239
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,720
and I'll introduce another word

240
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,470
XY And Z are on the same they're all lined on the same line

241
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
If you would imagine that a line

242
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,270
could keep going on and on forever and ever;

243
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,150
So we can say that XY and Z are collinear

244
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,200
So those three points are co- that they are collinear

245
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,240
They all sit on the same line or

246
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,320
And they also all sit on the line segment XY

247
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:49,970
Now let's say we know, we're told that XZ is equal to ZY

248
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,060
And they are all collinear

249
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,900
so that means

250
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,890
This is telling us that the distance between X and Z

251
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,820
is the same as the distance between Z and Y

252
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,970
so sometimes we can we can mark it like that

253
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,020
This distance is the same as that distance over there

254
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,320
So that tells us that Z is exactly half way between X and Y

255
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,370
So in this situation we would call Z the midpoint

256
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:22,090
The midpoint of line segment XY coz it's exactly half way between

257
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,580
Now to finish up,

258
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,210
we've talked about things that have zero dimensions, points

259
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,850
We've talked about things that have one dimension-

260
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,810
a line, a line segment or a ray

261
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,850
you might say well what has two dimensions?

262
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,460
Well in order to have two dimensions

263
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,310
That means I can go backwards and forwards

264
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,580
in two different directions

265
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,160
So this page right here or this video

266
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,480
or the screen that you're looking at is a two dimensional object

267
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,740
I can go

268
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,000
I can go right left that is one dimension;

269
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,150
or I can go up down

270
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,150
And so this surface of the monitor you're looking at

271
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,680
Is actually two dimensions

272
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,500
Two dimensions

273
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,980
You can go backwards or forwards in two directions

274
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,970
And things that are two dimensions, we call them planar

275
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,270
Or we call them planes

276
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,450
So if you took a if you took a piece of paper

277
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,680
Then extend it forever; just extended in every direction forever

278
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,330
That, in a Geometrical sense was a plane

279
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,990
The piece of paper itself; the thing that's finite

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,780
And you'll never see this talked about in a typical Geometry class

281
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,480
But I guess if we were to draw the analogy

282
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,250
You could call a piece of paper, maybe a plane segment

283
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,800
Because it's a segment of an entire plane

284
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,450
If you had a third dimension then you're talking about kind of

285
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,860
A three dimensional space

286
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,040
In three dimensional space,

287
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,340
not only could you move left or right along the screen

288
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,260
Or up and down,

289
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,430
you could also move in and out of the screen

290
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,220
You can also have this dimension that I'll try to draw

291
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,500
You could go into the screen

292
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,260
or you could go out of the screen like that

293
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,170
And as we go to higher and higher Mathematics

294
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,940
Although it becomes very hard to visualize,

295
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,330
you'll see that we can even start to study things

296
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,440
That have more than three dimensions
