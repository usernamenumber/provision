1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,680
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,210
I'm now going to do a bit of a
review of everything we've

4
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,080
learned so far about maybe even
trigonometry and

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,350
trig identities.

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,450
And then we'll see if we can
come up with-- maybe use what

7
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,050
we already know to come up with
a couple more trig identities.

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,940
So we know that from
SOH-CAH-TOA we know that sine

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:26,070
of theta is equal to the
opposite over the hypotenuse.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,270
Let me draw a triangle here.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,560
If I were to draw a
triangle here-- whoops.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,380
Oh, there you go.

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,780
OK, so this is theta.

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,180
This is the opposite.

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,410
This is the adjacent.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,400
This is hypotenuse.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,460
Then sine of theta is equal
to opposite over hypotenuse.

18
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,040
Cosine of theta-- this is basic
review, hopefully at this

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,170
point-- is the adjacent
over the hypotenuse.

20
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,470
The tangent of theta is equal
to the opposite over the

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,770
adjacent, which is also equal
to the sine of theta over

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,590
the cosine of theta.

23
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,380
And we showed this in a
couple of videos ago.

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,160
And then, these are kind of
almost definitional, but the

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:17,840
cosecant of theta is equal
to the hypotenuse over the

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,260
opposite, which is the same
thing as 1 over sine of theta.

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,900
You can just memorize this.

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,120
I mean, I kind of find is
silly that there is such

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,100
a thing as cosecant.

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,330
I guess it's just for
convenience because you know

31
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,410
everyone knows it's just
1 over sine of theta.

32
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,830
And same thing for secant.

33
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,140
Secant of theta-- it's
really for convenience.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,990
Instead of having to say, in
the case of secant-- oh, that's

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,910
1 you know-- if you end up with
the equation 1 over cosine of

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,200
theta you can just say,
oh, that's just the

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,550
secant of theta.

38
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,573
I think it actually has some
obvious properties and if you

39
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:50,450
were to draw unit circle
and all of that too.

40
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,760
But anyway, so that's equal
to the hypotenuse over the

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,400
adjacent, which is equal to
1 over cosine of theta.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,160
And then, of course, cotangent
of theta is equal to the

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,430
adjacent over the opposite,
which is equal to

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,260
1 over tan theta.

45
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,010
And of course, that's
also equal to cosine of

46
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,430
theta over sine theta.

47
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,310
It's just the opposite of
the tangent of theta.

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,470
Or that's the same
thing as what?

49
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,230
That's the same thing as
the secant-- no, no, no.

50
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,632
It's the same thing as the
cosecant-- no, no no.

51
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:38,600
Let me make sure I
get this right.

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,700
It's the same thing as the-- I
just want to get the inverses.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,050
Well, let's prove
what it is actually.

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,110
I always confuse myself.

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:59,060
So this is the same thing as 1
over the secant of theta over

56
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,730
1 over the cosecant of theta.

57
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,770
   

58
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,370
Secant of theta,
cosecant theta.

59
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,700
And then that equals the
cosecant of theta over

60
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,190
the secant of theta.

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,110
I wouldn't waste your
time memorizing.

62
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,930
So we know that a cotangent
of theta is equal to

63
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,240
1 over tangent theta.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,300
Is equal to the cosine
over the sine.

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,040
And it also equals the
cosecant over the secant.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,690
And I wouldn't worry about
really memorizing this.

67
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,840
You could derive
it if you had to.

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,460
As you could tell, I
really didn't have

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,850
this memorized either.

70
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:38,380
And we also learned in previous
videos that the sine squared

71
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,440
theta plus the cosine squared
of theta is equal to 1.

72
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,530
And that just comes from
the pythagorean theorem.

73
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,170
And if you play around with
this a little bit you'd also

74
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:55,950
get that the tangent squared
theta plus 1 is equal to

75
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,380
the secant squared theta.

76
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,110
You actually go from here to
here if you just divide both

77
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,010
sides of this equation
by cosine squared.

78
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,860
So we know that.

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,020
And then if you've watched the
last two proof videos I made,

80
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:20,180
we also know that the sine of--
let's say a plus b-- is equal

81
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:31,670
to the sine of a times
the cosine of b.

82
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,890
Plus-- let me erase some
of this because I don't

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,590
think that that is an
important trig identity.

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,730
You can derive it on your own.

85
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,570
I just wanted to show you that
you could figure it out.

86
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm using too much space.

87
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,320
OK, now I have space.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,330
Let me find that blue color
I was using and make

89
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,650
sure my pen is small.

90
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,015
OK.

91
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:56,040
So it's the sine of a times
the cosine of b plus the sine

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,430
of b times the cosine of a.

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,690
And you might want to
just memorize it.

94
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,370
This actually becomes really
useful when you actually start

95
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,090
doing calculus because you have
to solve derivatives and

96
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,720
integrals that you might
have to know the identity.

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,870
And it's not that
hard to memorize.

98
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,080
It's the sine of one of them
times the cosine of one of them

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,370
plus the other way around.

100
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,130
That's all this is.

101
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,200
And then we also learned that
the cosine of a plus b-- it's

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,960
the cosine of both of them
minus the sine of both them.

103
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:36,890
So that is equal to the cosine
of a times the cosine of b.

104
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,400
And I proved this in another
video, hopefully did it

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,180
to your satisfaction.

106
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,160
Minus the sine of a
times the sine of b.

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,990
   

108
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,110
These are pretty useful because
from these can we can come up

109
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,040
with a bunch of other
trig identities.

110
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,280
For example, what
is the sine of 2a?

111
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,900
   

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,360
Well, that's just the same
thing as the sine of a plus a.

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,670
   

114
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,010
And if we use this trig
identity up here, that is equal

115
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:27,850
to sine of a cosine of a plus
the sine of a, cosine of a.

116
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,560
I just used this sine of a plus
b identity up here and well,

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,982
want a and b are both a.

118
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:34,110
Now what does this equal?

119
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,990
Well, this is two terms
that are just both sine

120
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,810
of a, cosine of a.

121
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:43,300
So that just equals 2
sine of a, cosine of a.

122
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,030
So we now have derived another
trigonometric identity that

123
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,650
might be in the inside cover of
your trig, or actually,

124
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,270
your calculus book.

125
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,940
All of these actually,
I could draw a square

126
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,540
around all of them.

127
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,110
Let's do another one.

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,070
Once you have a bit of a
library of trig identities you

129
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,680
can really just keep playing
around and seeing what else you

130
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,930
can-- and I encourage
you to do so.

131
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,890
And you'd be amazed how
many other trig identities

132
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,610
you could come up with.

133
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,490
For example, let's
do cosine of 2a.

134
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:25,410
Cosine of 2a is equal
to cosine of a plus a.

135
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,530
And cosine of a plus
a, what did we say?

136
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,220
It's the cosine of both of the
terms times each other minus

137
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,160
the sine of both of the terms.

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,750
So that equals cosine of
a, cosine of a, right?

139
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:46,020
Cosine of a times cosine of a
minus sine of a, sine of a.

140
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,080
This identity was the cosine
of a plus b identity.

141
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,260
Minus sine of a.

142
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,030
So what is this?

143
00:07:51,030 --> 00:08:03,280
This is equal to cosine squared
a minus sine squared a.

144
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
That's interesting.

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,310
We could play around.

146
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,830
This is interesting because
this is the form a

147
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,880
squared minus b squared.

148
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,770
So that's also the same thing
as a plus b times a minus b.

149
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:22,120
So that's the same thing as
cosine of a plus sine of a

150
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,950
times cosine of a
minus sine of a.

151
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,360
I don't know.

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,250
This isn't really a trig
identity, but I'm just showing

153
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,310
you could play with things.

154
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,650
Cosine of 2a is equal to cosine
of a plus sine of a times

155
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,290
cosine of a minus sine of a.

156
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,400
So the sum of the cosine
and sine of a then

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,000
times the difference.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,760
That's just interesting.

159
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,870
I'm just showing you that
what's fun about trigonometry

160
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,740
is you can kind of keep
playing around with it.

161
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,010
And actually, that's probably--
that is how all of the trig

162
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,680
identities were discovered.

163
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,830
So let's say that we have-- we
want to figure out what cosine

164
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,940
of let's say, negative a is.

165
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,945
Well, let me draw
a right triangle.

166
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:06,260
   

167
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,645
Whoops.

168
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,265
That's almost a right triangle.

169
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,850
Now let's say this angle is a.

170
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,450
So negative a, unit circle
would look something

171
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,240
like this, right?

172
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,250
Negative a.

173
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,750
So cosine of a, if we say that
this side is the adjacent

174
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,260
side, this is the hypotenuse.

175
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,280
This would still be the
hypotenuse, right?

176
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,710
And this is the opposite.

177
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,350
This is the negative opposite.

178
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,500
So cosine of minus a
is equal to what?

179
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,260
This is minus a, so it's the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

180
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,860
So it equals the adjacent
over the hypotenuse,

181
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,470
which we just say is h.

182
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,070
But that's the same thing
as cosine of a, right?

183
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,130
Because cosine of a is also the
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

184
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,870
   

185
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,960
Oh, I'm almost out of time.

186
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,050
Let me switch to a new video.
