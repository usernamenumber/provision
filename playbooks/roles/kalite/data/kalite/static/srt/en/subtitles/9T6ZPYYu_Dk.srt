00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:04,637
Welcome to my presentation on return on capital

2
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:20,833
Let's say we had return on capital

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,813
Now I wanna do this presentation first because

4
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:27,100
I think this is going to give you the big picture on how you need to think about

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,347
what something is worth, whether you should invest your money into it,

6
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:37,789
and how you should weigh the different options you had in terms of where you want it to point

7
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:41,517
you want to put it in the bank, you want to put it in a house, do you want to pay off your credit cards, etc, etc

8
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:46,254
so let's just define "return on capital", and just so you know

9
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:50,852
I'm not neccessarily gonna be strict on the accounting conventions or the gap conventions

10
00:00:53,037 --> 00:00:56,750
I'm gonna do it more hands-on, how a "Joe investor" should

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,276
think about their money. So, in this senario, I define "return on capital" as just

12
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:12,678
the cash you get per year divided

13
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:23,775
by the total cash you put in

14
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:28,245
and well, I don't wanna just say cash. There's other ways to measure return

15
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:31,291
but let's just keep it simple. let's just say cash

16
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:36,506
so let's think about how this works out. let's say I have an idea, I have a restaurant

17
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:44,400
and that restaurant will cost a million dollars

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,060
of investment

19
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,397
and let's say that per year, after paying all the expenses, after paying all the utilities

20
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:06,086
after paying all the employees, after repairing and maintenance, after paying taxes

21
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:11,860
this restaurant makes 100k per year.

22
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,719
In this situation, my return on

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:26,379
capital, the way I've defined it, is 100k divided by 1 million, or you could say 1000k,

24
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,923
equals 10%. Pretty straight forward. You might be saying

25
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:35,828
"Sal, this is silly, why are you wasting my time?" Well, maybe it is

26
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:42,075
but I think you'll find that this going to lay a foundation that will eventually blow your mind

27
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,212
so let's keep going.

28
00:02:52,704 --> 00:03:00,048
Okay, so I said the restaurant

29
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:06,178
return on capital is equal to 10%. I could put

30
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:10,079
a million dollars and I'll get in 100k per year

31
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,823
now's that one project. and let's say I know for sure that I'm gonna,

32
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:32,712
and I'm not gonna factor in things like risk just yet

33
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:38,799
let's just say for sure i know that if i put my money here I'm gonna get 10% on my money

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,652
and let's say the other option with my money is

35
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,927
a beauty parlor

36
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:04,135
and let's say that also costs 1 million dollars

37
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:16,414
and this beauty parlor gets me 50k per year

38
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:20,203
I think it's very obvious which investment you'd rather invest in

39
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:26,286
because the return on capital on this beauty parlor is only 50k divided by a million

40
00:04:26,286 --> 00:04:31,381
or 5%. So this is obvious. you'd rather do the restaurant than the beauty parlor

41
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:36,768
and in general you, after adjusting for risk, always wanna go

42
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,896
with the project with the higher return on capital

43
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:44,352
and later on there will be nuances in terms of when you get that return

44
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,837
maybe you'd like a slightly lower return if you get the money faster

45
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:50,144
or a slightly higher return if

46
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:55,566
you're taking on risk or to compensate for risk

47
00:04:55,566 --> 00:05:00,791
So we know we want to do the restaurant but do we definitely want to do the restaurant?

48
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,994
I mean we'd rather do the restaurant than the beauty parlor

49
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:09,415
but my question to you is "Do we definitely want to do the restaurant?"

50
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:13,317
and this is where the return on capital becomes interesting

51
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:17,556
because what matters before we put the money into the restaurant is to think about

52
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:20,064
what the cost of the money is to us

53
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:23,208
and this is what I think will be a little bit of a new concept

54
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:27,169
so I'm gonna introduce you now to the notion of a "cost of capital"

55
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:41,933
so the restaurant costs a million dollars and it gets me

56
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:46,174
100k a year

57
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:52,387
thats a 10% return on capital.

58
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:56,000
let's say I have to borrow all the money and theres some bank that willing to give me

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,349
all the money for this restaurant and the interest rate on this loan

60
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,776
the interest rate is 15%

61
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:16,475
is it still a good idea for me to open up a restaurant?

62
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:19,941
Well, if I have a loan and I have to borrow the whole amount

63
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:25,001
So I have a loan of a million dollars to buy that same restaurant

64
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:29,123
and Im gonna be charged 15% in interest every year

65
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,354
and I'm not gonna take taxes and the fact that you can deduct taxes etc etc

66
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,924
into account just yet

67
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:37,178
Let's just assume that my total cost is 15% per year in interest

68
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:46,616
so I'm gonna have to spend 150k per year in interest

69
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:51,968
So my question is "Does it still make sense for me to open up this restaurant?"

70
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:57,077
every year im gonna be making 100k from the restaurant itself but im gonna be paying

71
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:04,879
150k a year in interest. you'll probably say "Sal, once again you've just restated the obvious

72
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,200
no you would not want to do this restaurant

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,659
because every year, 50k will be burning out of your pocket"

74
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,467
Now you might think that this is obvious but I'm gonna show you many examples

75
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,464
of where people are actively doing this

76
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:23,692
people who you would otherwise assume could do this math and it's especially happening in the housing market

77
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:28,338
but anyway in this situation you wouldn't want to invest it and a very simple way

78
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:36,829
of thinking about this is you only want to invest, you only want to do a project, if your return on capital

79
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:46,678
is greater than your cost of capital

80
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:51,591
this is the only time that you want to invest in a project

81
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,111
I just showed you something that we thought was obvious

82
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:02,527
but I'm gonna re-ask you a question

83
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:07,991
so we had the restaurant, we have the beauty parlor

84
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:11,752
they both cost a million dollars

85
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,814
the ROC of the restaurant is 10%

86
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,647
and the ROC of the beauty parlor is 5%

87
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:24,062
so right now, it looks like the restaurant is the better project

88
00:08:24,062 --> 00:08:28,271
but then we said the cost of capital, the interest rate

89
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:31,274
which is how much does it cost us to get the million dollars

90
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:36,040
the interest rate is 15%

91
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,812
and we said that this is not a good investment

92
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:43,225
because our cost of capital is greater than the return on capital

93
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,653
but what if there was some kind of government program

94
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:47,100
and they just felt that

95
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,600
there werent enough beauty parlors in the country

96
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,059
and they want to give you a really cheap loan to buy a beauty parlor

97
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,471
and the government program said "We're gonna give you a low interest loan

98
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,486
of 2%". so my question to you is "NOW which project would you rather do?"

99
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:09,384
superficially, it looks like the restaurant is better. you get a 10% return as opposed to 5%

100
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:13,564
but the cost of capital, the interest rate you'd have to pay on a loan for the beauty parlor

101
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:15,793
suddenly looks a little bit better

102
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,301
in fact this is actually a good investment

103
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,062
because your cost of capital is less than your return on capital

104
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,316
and we could be do the math

105
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:25,127
every year the beauty parlor will generate

106
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:31,072
50k and you'll be paying 20k in interest

107
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:34,647
so you'll be netting 30k without having to put any money for yourself

108
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:37,387
you'll be borrowing all the money so clearly this is a good investment

109
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:43,889
so thats it now for the intro on return on capital and cost of capital

110
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:46,815
in my next presentations ill go a little bit more in detail

111
00:09:46,815 --> 99:59:59,000
and do a few more nuanced examples
