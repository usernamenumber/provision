1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,095
What I want to do in this video is to explore

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:06,822
the notion of a matrix outside the context of

3
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:10,504
a surprisingly good movie that involves Keanu Reeves.

4
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:11,623
And it is actually the first of three.

5
00:00:11,623 --> 00:00:12,317
I guess we could call

6
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:15,087
the three movies combined 'The Matrices.'

7
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:17,782
And, in fact, there is a relationship between the movie –

8
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,177
which is about a virtual reality

9
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,973
constructed by super smart computers –

10
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:24,968
and the relation and the notion of what a matrix is

11
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:27,008
when you study it in mathematics,

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,519
or when you study it in computer science.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,034
The connection really is that matrices are used a lot

14
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,996
when you are assimilating things or constructing things

15
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:39,142
in computer science –

16
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:43,288
especially in, frankly, computer graphics.

17
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:47,435
Then, the super intelligent robots that made the matrix in the movie Matrix probably using matrixes to in order to do it.

18
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,844
If they actually did exist.

19
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:52,501
Now, what is a matrix then?

20
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:56,510
Well, that is a fairly simple answer: its just a rectangular array of numbers.

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:07,334
So, for example, this right over here: 1, 0, -7, pi, 5 and ... 11. This is a matrix.

22
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:20,751
This is a matrix where 1, 0, -7, pi ... each of those are entries in the matrix. This matrix right over here has 2 rows and 3 columns.

23
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:27,969
And, because it has 2 rows and 3 columns, people will say that it is a 2 x 3 matrix.

24
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:32,929
Whenever they say ' this is a something by something matrix ', they're telling you that it has 2 rows.

25
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,242
So you see the 2 rows right over there and they are telling you

26
00:01:35,242 --> 00:01:40,733
And they are telling you that it has has 3 columns, you see the 3 columns right there.

27
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:45,743
I can give you other examples of matrixes. So I could have a 1 x 1 matrix ...

28
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,505
So I could have the matrix 1.

29
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:52,074
This right over here is a 1 x1 matrix. It has one row and one column

30
00:01:52,074 --> 00:02:02,958
I can have a matrix like this ... 3, 7 and 17. What is this? Well, this has 1 row, this is the one row we see right here.

31
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:07,077
And it has 3 columns, this is a 1 x 3 matrix.

32
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,655
I could have a matrix, and I think you see where all of this is going,

33
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:13,104
Figuring out the dimensions of a matrix is not too difficult.

34
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:20,235
I could have a matrix that looks like this, where its 3, 5, 0, 0, -1, -7

35
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,754
This 7 is negative 7.

36
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:31,324
This right over here has 3 rows, so its 3 rows and it has 2 columns.

37
00:02:31,324 --> 00:02:36,503
So we would call it a 3 by 2 matrix,

38
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:46,236
let me do that in the same colour, we would call it a 3 by 2 matrix, 3 rows, and 2 columns.

39
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:51,328
So fair enough, you know that a matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers,

40
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:54,770
you can say what its dimensions are, you know that each of these numbers,

41
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,378
that take one of these positions, we just call these entries,

42
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,110
But what are matrixes good for?

43
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,507
I still might not be clear what the connection is between this and this right over here.

44
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:08,331
And the most fundamental level well these are just ways to, a compact representation,

45
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,585
of a bunch of numbers, its a way of representing information.

46
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:18,378
They become very valuable in computer graphics because these numbers could represent the colour intensity at a certain point

47
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:21,176
They could represent whether or not an object is there at a certain point.

48
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:26,578
And as we develop an algebra around matrixes, and when we talk about developing an algebra around matrixes,

49
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,437
We are going to talk about operations that we are going to perform on matrixes.

50
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,710
That we would normally perform with numbers.

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,896
So we are going to learn how or essentially define how to multiply matrixes, add matrixes,

52
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:45,436
How to even take the inverse of a matrix and coming up with an algebra, how we manipulate these things,

53
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:49,328
It'll become very useful in the future when you're trying to write a computer graphics program,

54
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:51,105
or you're trying to do an economics simulation, or a probability simulation,

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:57,037
to say oh, I have this matrix that represents where different particles are in space,

56
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:01,651
or this matrix represents the state of some type of game.

57
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:06,656
And I know the algebra of matrixes, and I know ways of doing it very efficiently,

58
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:10,100
So that I can, multiply a bunch of them, or I could come run a simulation,

59
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,236
and I could actually come up with useful results.

60
00:04:12,236 --> 00:04:19,101
So that's all matrixes are, but as you'll see through this, we can define operations on them.

61
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:23,924
And later on, when you take a linear algebra course in college, you learn a lot more of the depth,

62
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:28,293
of how they can be applied, and what you can use them to represent.
