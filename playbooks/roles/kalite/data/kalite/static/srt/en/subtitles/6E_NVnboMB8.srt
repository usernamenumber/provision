1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:01,210
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,410
Whenever I start running out
of time I rush things and I

4
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,670
most probably confuse you.

5
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,000
So let me go over that last
example one more time.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So I said I have a completely
fair coin and I'm going to

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,400
flip it twice, and I want to
know the probability that

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,865
I get heads in both times.

9
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:19,740
   

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,150
Well, we already know the
probability that I get heads

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,250
the first time is 1/2.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,240
There's 1/2 chance I get heads
the first time and there's

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,740
1/2 chance that I get
tails the first time.

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,450
And then I'm going to flip
again, and let's say, in this

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,560
world, there's a 1/2 chance
that we enter into this reality

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,980
where the first flip is heads,
and then in that world I'm

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,190
going to flip a coin again.

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,590
And I know that there's a half
a chance of heads-- this is

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,250
the second flip-- and
1/2 chance of tails.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,250
And I know in this other
world-- I'll just draw it

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,920
so we can figure out maybe
other probabilities.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
I know that there's 1/2
chance of heads, so this

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,360
is for the second flip.

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,355
And I know that there's
1/2 chance of tails

25
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:08,130
on the second flip.

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,260
And just so you know, this is
called a probability tree.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,430
And in general, it works
excellent if you're not

28
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,550
dealing with huge numbers.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,480
If you're not dealing with--
I'm doing 100 trials or the

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,390
probabilities get really messy
or in each trial there's 50

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,050
different circumstances
that can occur.

32
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,180
   

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,890
In this situation there's two
branches per-- you could say

34
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,270
per node, so there's not that
many circumstances that

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,880
can occur on each trial.

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,350
And we're not doing that
many trials, so it's

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,120
pretty manageable.

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,110
And in these situations,
the probability tree

39
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,240
works really well.

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,450
You can never get overwhelmed
with the information then.

41
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,330
And I'll show you, we'll do
some pretty complicated

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,950
examples using
probability tree.

43
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,930
There's no reason why I
actually circled that with

44
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,620
yellow; I just happened
to switch to yellow.

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,420
But anyway, just so you know,
this was the first trial.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,220
   

47
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,300
This is the second trial.

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,400
   

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,370
We want to know the probability
of getting here because we got

50
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,120
heads on the first trial,
heads in the second.

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,330
Well, we know that there was a
1/2 chance of getting there and

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,660
then we know of that 1/2 or you
know, 1/2 the times we got

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,100
here, 1/2 of those times
you would get there.

54
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,910
So the probability of getting
there is 1/2 times 1/2,

55
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,880
which is equal to 1/4.

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,930
Another way of thinking about
it is each of these scenarios--

57
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,980
this is a scenario heads, heads
because you got a heads

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,240
and then a heads.

59
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,920
This is the scenario
heads, tails.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,940
This is the scenario
tails, heads.

61
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,690
You got a tail, then
you got a heads.

62
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,230
And this is the
scenario tails, tails.

63
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,780
And all of these are equally
probable scenarios.

64
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,170
There's no reason why one is
more likely than the other.

65
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,990
And so we have 4 equally
probable scenarios, so

66
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,275
the total of equally
probable scenarios is 4.

67
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:05,770
   

68
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,510
How many of these equal
probable scenarios is our

69
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,610
probability or our event true?

70
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,300
Well, it's one of
them-- heads heads.

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,160
So it's 1/4.

72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,050
So that's another
way of viewing it.

73
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,710
Another way you could view it
is if we did this trial a

74
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,910
hundred times, if we did is a
hundred times, 50 of the times

75
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,150
my first flip will be heads.

76
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,000
And then of those 50 times 25
of those times-- half of those

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,680
trials where I got 50 the first
time will be heads again.

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,330
And so 25 out of the total 100
trials will end up with heads

79
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,650
heads, or this is 25% chance.

80
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,230
I wanted to show you that all
of these are pretty much the

81
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,870
equivalent, but I want your
brain to kind of connect

82
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,460
and make sure that it
understands everything.

83
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,343
So now that we've drawn this
probability tree I don't want

84
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:55,685
it to go to waste, so let me
give you another circumstance.

85
00:03:55,685 --> 00:04:05,000
   

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,020
What's the probability I get
one heads and one tail?

87
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,840
   

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,430
And notice, I'm not saying that
it has to be in that order.

89
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,950
You know, it could be tails,
heads or heads, tail.

90
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,840
Let me write that down.

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,930
This is equal to the
probability of tails, heads

92
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,990
plus the probability
of heads, tails.

93
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,300
Or we could write that as-- and
this is kind of with set theory

94
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,570
notation, but it's good to be
familiar with all of these.

95
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,980
It's a probability of getting
tail, heads or this U looking

96
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,050
thing means or in set theory.

97
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,860
Or the probability of getting
heads, tails, right?

98
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,830
We can get tails, heads
or heads, tails.

99
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,380
In either of these we're
getting one heads

100
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,280
and one tails.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,920
So what's that probability?

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,370
Well, we can just look at all
of the outcomes and we know

103
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,020
that there are 4 equally
probable outcomes.

104
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,240
And then, how many of these is
the event that we want true?

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Well, it's 1, 2.

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,280
So there's a 2/4 or equal 1/4
chance where when we do both of

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,810
these flips we get at least one
heads and at least one tails.

108
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,260
And I think that's a good time
now that we've drawn this tree

109
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,070
and we've talked about two
flips in a row, to realize that

110
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,880
these are mutually
exclusive events.

111
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,030
The reason why we can multiply
the probability of the first

112
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,280
event times the probability of
the second event is because the

113
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,480
probability of getting heads
the second time is completely

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,160
independent of whether I
got heads the first time.

115
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,340
And that might be obvious to
you, but sometimes it isn't.

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,390
You know, some people feel that
if they got 5 heads in a row

117
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:51,360
that they're more likely to get
a tails on the sixth time.

118
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,450
But what we know from
experience really, is that no,

119
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,170
it's not like the coin knows
that you got 5 heads in a row

120
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,820
and then it says, oh boy, I
better give Sal a tails now

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,160
just to kind of make up for
all the 5 heads he got.

122
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,370
It's equally problems
to get a heads again.

123
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,600
So that's just something
to keep in mind.

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,370
And it's amazing how just human
beings psychologically-- you

125
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,250
feel that if you have a
big streak of heads that

126
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,350
you're due for a tails.

127
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,660
But your probability of getting
that tails does not increase.

128
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,830
Although, if you keep doing
it you're probability of

129
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,301
eventually-- the more times you
do it, the probability of

130
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,810
getting a tails does increase
and I'll show you that soon.

131
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,520
   

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,930
That last statement probably
confused you and I probably

133
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,130
shouldn't have said it.

134
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,840
Let's do an example.

135
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,830
Now that we know that in
mutually exclusive events

136
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,700
you can just multiply
the probabilities.

137
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,530
So let's say I have a fair coin
and what's the probability

138
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,540
of getting 5 heads in a row?

139
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,560
   

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,090
Well, I have a 1/2 chance of
getting heads the first time.

141
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,230
Then of those, 1/2.

142
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,990
Then another 1/2.

143
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:10,430
So it's 1/2 times 1/2 times
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

144
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,470
And that equals 1/2
to the fifth power.

145
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,790
That's equal to 1 over
2 to the fifth power.

146
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,260
And that's 1/32.

147
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,280
That's the probability of
getting 5 heads in a row.

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,200
   

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,460
What's the probability of
getting-- let's say I were

150
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,120
to flip a coin seven times.

151
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,420
So let's say I flip a coin, out
of seven times, what's the

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,035
probability of not
getting any heads?

153
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:53,700
   

154
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,270
I'm going to switch colors
just for the hell of it.

155
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,080
   

156
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,300
Well that might seem a little
bit more convoluted to you,

157
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,100
but just think about it.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,050
The probability of out of the
seven flips of not getting

159
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,760
any heads, that is equal--
what has to be true then?

160
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,900
We got all tails then.

161
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,090
That's equal to the probability
of getting 7 tails in a row.

162
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,570
   

163
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,510
And what does that equal?

164
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,900
Well, the tails are equally
likely to the heads.

165
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,250
So that would be 1/2
to the seventh power.

166
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,570
That equals-- what is that?

167
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:44,060
So it'll be 4 times 132,
so that's equal to 1/128.

168
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,600
And a fun experiment to do is
maybe in your classroom or if

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,460
you have a large group of
people together, maybe 128 or

170
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,610
some large number of people
and you make everyone flip

171
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,470
a coin multiple times.

172
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,710
By the end of 5 or 6 or 7
flips, there will probably be--

173
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,660
and later on we'll actually
figure out the probability

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,750
that there is someone
who has a streak.

175
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,860
But there will probably be
someone who has a very long

176
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,410
streak of heads or tails.

177
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,510
And that person will probably
think that there's something

178
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,140
magical about what is going on
in their life at that moment.

179
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,610
And it's important to realize
if you have a large room, if

180
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,730
you have a room of 500 people,
someone's going to be getting--

181
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,670
there's a likelihood and we
haven't figured that out yet,

182
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:31,520
but just given that you have a
1 in 128 chance of getting 7

183
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,670
heads or 7 tails in a row.

184
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,100
Someone's going to get if you
have 500 people flipping coins.

185
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,030
But that person, they just view
their own reality, they think

186
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,080
that today is their lucky day.

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,820
And they think that they're on
some type of streak and that

188
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,440
they should go to Vegas.

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,920
But that's just something that
you should think about because

190
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,280
probability can often
play with our brains.

191
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,240
But anyway, I have 10
seconds left, so I will

192
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
see you in the next video.

193
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,500
