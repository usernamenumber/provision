1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,450
What I want to do with this
video is talk about

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,700
nucleophilicity.

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:14,180
   

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,270
This is really just how good of
a nucleophile something is.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,180
Or I'll just make up a
definition right now: the

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:35,680
ability for an atom slash ion
slash molecule to act as a

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:51,220
nucleophile, or to give away
extra electrons and bond with

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,930
a nucleus or with
something else.

10
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,180
I'll say with a nucleus.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:01,490
   

12
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,420
I want to say with a nucleus,
because that's what

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,480
nucleophilicity is saying.

14
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,450
It loves nucleuses, especially
positive ones, that it can

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,420
give its extra electrons
to it.

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,150
Now, as a first cut, if you
want to identify a good

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,660
nucleophile, it should have
extra electrons to give away.

18
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:32,160
   

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,510
The best things that have extra
electrons to give away

20
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,750
are negative ions or anions, so
just at a very high level,

21
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,770
something like the
fluoride anion.

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,590
Normally, fluorine has seven
valence electrons: one, two,

23
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,130
three, four, five, six, seven,
but it's so electronegative,

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,700
it might be able swipe off
another electron from

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,880
something else and then it
becomes the fluoride anion.

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,650
Then it becomes the fluoride
anion with a negative charge.

27
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,150
You can do that for all
of the halides.

28
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,145
You could do that
for chlorine.

29
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:07,860
It can become chloride.

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,210
Bromine can be bromide.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,360
Iodine could be iodide.

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,190
Let me do iodine, too.

33
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,060
Iodine, once again,
it's a halide.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,590
It has seven valence
electrons.

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,980
It has many, many more electrons
than fluorine, but

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,250
if you just look at
its valence shell,

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,730
it has seven electrons.

38
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,850
And then it is also reasonably
electronegative, not as

39
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,220
electronegative as fluorine.

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,060
Remember, the trend goes like
this from the bottom left to

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,740
the top right.

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,930
So fluorine is extremely
electronegative, but iodine is

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,110
still pretty electronegative.

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,490
It is a halogen so it also might
be able to swipe off an

45
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,560
electron from someone else
and become iodide.

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,250
   

47
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,380
In general, things with extra
electrons, lone pairs of

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,820
electrons, and especially a
negative charge, are going to

49
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,880
be pretty good nucleophiles.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,570
Another example that's
not a halide is the

51
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,340
hydroxide anion, so OH.

52
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,420
This is an example of something
that is a molecule.

53
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,770
Maybe traditionally water
would look like this.

54
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,430
Traditionally, this is just
neutral water, and oxygen has

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,600
two lone pairs like that,
but oxygen is pretty

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,650
electronegative.

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,530
It is already kind of taking the
electrons away from one of

58
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,210
the hydrogens, and at some
point, it might just take it

59
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,900
altogether and then you have
the hydroxide anion.

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,540
This would look like this.

61
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,370
You have your original two lone
pairs, just like that,

62
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,010
and then you have this pair
that's going to be taken.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,100
It already had that electron.

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,490
It takes that electron from the
hydrogen, so now it has

65
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,000
two more electrons.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Let me color code it so
you see what it took.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,350
It took this electron from the
hydrogen and now this also has

68
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,990
a negative charge.

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,280
That's also a reasonably
good nucleophile.

70
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,815
And, of course, you have
your hydrogen now.

71
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:58,770
It lost its one electron.

72
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,320
It only has a proton
in its nucleus.

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,580
Whenever you see H plus, this
is really just a proton.

74
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
There's nothing else
to that hydrogen.

75
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,730
So that's hydroxide.

76
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,100
These are all reasonably good
nucleophiles in that they have

77
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,020
something to give away.

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,000
They have extra charge.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,209
Now, what I want to do is think
about between these, how

80
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,620
do you think about what's going
to be a stronger or

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,180
weaker nucleophile?

82
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,020
And here, it becomes a little
bit more nuanced.

83
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,090
What we're going to do is
differentiate what happens in

84
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,980
a protic solvent versus what
happens in an aprotic solvent.

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,310
Let me write down.

86
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,510
Let me start with a
protic solvent.

87
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,400
   

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,050
I'll make two columns here,
protic solvent and then we'll

89
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:54,030
do aprotic solvent
right over here.

90
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,830
Once again, these are fancy
words, but they mean something

91
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,680
pretty simple.

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,850
Protic solvent is something that
has hydrogens that can be

93
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,820
taken away or might have free
protons floating around.

94
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,060
An example of a protic
solvent is water

95
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,800
or really any alcohol.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
Water is the simplest example
or maybe the most common.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,620
The reason why you might have
protons floating around is

98
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,020
exactly this reaction
I showed right here.

99
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,430
Maybe every now and then a
hydroxide anion forms. Even

100
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,330
more likely, maybe a water takes
a hydrogen from one of

101
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,910
the other waters.

102
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,790
One of the water molecules takes
hydrogen from one of the

103
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,490
other water molecules and
becomes a hydronium, where

104
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,665
it's not a proton necessarily,
but it's an oxygen.

105
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:41,930
   

106
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,980
Let's say if you start with
water and one of these

107
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,350
electrons were to be given to
some proton floating around,

108
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,900
it would look like this.

109
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,000
And it has a positive
charge and then this

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,410
proton is very available.

111
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,520
You can almost imagine it's
almost floating around because

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,400
that oxygen really wants to
take back that electron.

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,420
So protic solvent is water.

114
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,360
In water, you might see a little
bit of hydroxide, a

115
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,450
little bit of proton, a little
bit a hydronium.

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,810
You see all of it in there, but
the bottom line is that

117
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,005
there are protons that can
react with other things.

118
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,520
   

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,070
Let me clear this away so that
I have some real estate.

120
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,490
Let me just write down water.

121
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,400
Water is a protic solvent.

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,700
Now, wait.

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,290
Is that always the case?

124
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,510
It seems like hydrogens
are everywhere.

125
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,790
Well, no, it's not
always the case.

126
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,270
Let me show you an
aprotic solvent.

127
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,830
Diethyl ether looks like this.

128
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:41,050
   

129
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,150
And just so you know the naming,
it's an ether because

130
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,640
it has oxygen, and it's diethyl
because it has two

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,300
ethyl groups.

132
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,360
That's one ethyl group right
there and that is the second.

133
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,050
So it's diethyl ether.

134
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,230
Now, you might say, hey, this
guy's got hydrogens lying

135
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,890
around as well.

136
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,090
Maybe those can get released.

137
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,270
But, no, these hydrogens are
bonded to the carbon and

138
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,950
carbon is not anywhere near as
electronegative as oxygen.

139
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,600
Carbon is unlikely to steal
these hydrogens' electrons and

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,110
these hydrogens to be loose.

141
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,870
If they were bonded to the
oxygen, that would have been a

142
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,040
possibility.

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,500
With water, you have
obviously H-O-H.

144
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,400
In alcohols, you have some maybe
carbon chain bonded to

145
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,540
an oxygen, which is then
bonded to a hydrogen.

146
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,860
So in either of these cases,
in either water or alcohol,

147
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,030
you have these hydrogens where
the electron might be taken by

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,140
the oxygen because it's so
electronegative and then the

149
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,270
hydrogen floats around.

150
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,770
Anyway, that's a review of
protic versus aprotic.

151
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,850
In a protic solvent-- and this
is actually a general rule of

152
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,060
thumb-- if a nucleophile is
likely to react with its

153
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,290
solvent, it will be bad at
being a nucleophile.

154
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,950
Think about it.

155
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,410
If it's reacting with the
solvent, it's not going to be

156
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,320
able to do this.

157
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,710
It's not going to be able to
give its electrons away to

158
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,960
what it needs to give it away,
to maybe what we saw in an

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,270
Sn2-type reaction.

160
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,870
In a protic solvent, what
happens is that the things

161
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,970
that are really electronegative
and really

162
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,290
small, like a fluoride anion--
let me draw a fluoride anion.

163
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,520
   

164
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,250
In a protic solvent, what's
going to happen is it's going

165
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,050
to be blocked by
hydrogen bonds.

166
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,660
It's very negative, right?

167
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,940
It has a negative charge.

168
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,700
And it's also tightly packed.

169
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,909
As you can see right here,
its electrons are

170
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,500
very close, tied in.

171
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,150
It's a much smaller atom
or ion, in this case.

172
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,000
If we looked at iodide,
iodide has 53

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,290
electrons, many orbitals.

174
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,940
Actually, iodide
would have 54.

175
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,160
It would have the same
as iodine plus one.

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,740
Fluoride will have 10 electrons,
nine from fluorine

177
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,610
plus it gains another one, so
it's a much smaller atom.

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,450
So when you have water hanging
around it, let's say you have

179
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,740
something like water.

180
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,170
That has a negative charge.

181
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,800
Water is polar.

182
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,695
Actually, both of these are
polar, so I should write down

183
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:15,750
polar for both of these.

184
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,770
This is a polar protic
solvent.

185
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,270
This is a polar aprotic
solvent.

186
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,620
In this case, water is still
more electronegative than the

187
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,060
carbon, so it still has a
partial negative charge.

188
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,930
These parts still have
a partial negative.

189
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,200
Water still has a partial
negative charge.

190
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,780
The hydrogen has a partial
positive charge so it is going

191
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,970
to be attracted to
the fluorine.

192
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,280
This is going to happen all
around the fluorine.

193
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,900
And if these waters are
attracted to the fluorine in

194
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,580
kind of forming a tight shell
around it, it makes it hard

195
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,830
for fluorine to react.

196
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,870
   

197
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,680
So it's a worse nucleophile
than, say, iodide or hydroxide

198
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,700
in a polar protic solvent.

199
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,390
Hydroxide has the same issue.

200
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,030
It's still forming hydrogen
bonds, but if you wanted to

201
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,800
compare them, iodide
is much bigger.

202
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,630
Maybe I'll draw it like this.

203
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,010
I'll draw its valence
shell like this.

204
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:20,180
It's a much bigger ion.

205
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,270
It has all these electrons
in here.

206
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,310
And so, it still will form
hydrogen bonds with the water.

207
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,070
It still will form hydrogen
bonds with the hydrogen end of

208
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,510
the water because they're
partially positive, but it's

209
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,255
going to be less
tightly packed.

210
00:10:34,255 --> 00:10:47,180
And on top of that, iodide is
more polarizable, which means

211
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,500
that its electron cloud is so
big and the valence electrons

212
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,820
are so far away from the nucleus
that they can be

213
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,380
influenced by things and then
be more likely to react.

214
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,350
So let's say this iodide is
getting close to a carbon that

215
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,620
has a partial positive charge.

216
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,190
So let's say carbon is attached
to a bromine and then

217
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,210
it's attached to three
hydrogens.

218
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,480
We've seen that this will have
a partial negative charge.

219
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,450
It's more electronegative than
the carbon, which will have a

220
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,420
partial positive charge.

221
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,580
When this guy, this big guy with
the electrons really far

222
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,040
away, gets close to this, more
of the electron cloud is going

223
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,090
to be attracted to the partial
positive charge.

224
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,450
It'll get distorted a little bit
and so it is more likely

225
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,640
to react in a polar
protic solvent.

226
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,450
Fluoride, on the other hand,
is very tightly packed,

227
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,230
blocked by the hydrogen bonds.

228
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,020
It's less likely to react.

229
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,210
If you were to look at the
Periodic Table, if you look at

230
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:57,410
just the halogens in a polar
protic solvent, the halides--

231
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,420
this would be the ion version of
the halogens-- the halide's

232
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,810
iodide will be the
best nucleophile.

233
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,740
Fluoride will be the worst. So
in a polar protic solvent--

234
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:21,090
let me write this down-- we
have a situation where the

235
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,860
iodide is the best nucleophile,
followed by

236
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,900
bromide, followed by chloride,
and then last

237
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,920
of all is the fluoride.

238
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,870
The exact opposite is true
in an aprotic solvent.

239
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:42,720
In an aprotic solvent, the
fluoride, which is-- fluorine

240
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,755
is far more electronegative.

241
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:48,560
Fluoride is more basic.

242
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,120
It will be more stable if it
is able to form a bond with

243
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,030
something than iodide.

244
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,210
Iodide is pretty stable.

245
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,610
If you look at a hydrogen
iodide, it's actually a highly

246
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,590
acidic molecule.

247
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,200
So iodide itself, the conjugate
base of hydrogen

248
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
iodide, is going to be
a very bad base.

249
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,470
When you're dealing with an
aprotic solvent, you go in the

250
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,390
direction of basicity.

251
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,990
We're going to learn in the
next video that actually

252
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,170
basicity and nucleophilicity are
related, but they aren't

253
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,280
the same concept.

254
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,110
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

255
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,030
If you're in an aprotic solvent,
you're not reacting

256
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,320
with the solvent as much.

257
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,310
And then in this situation,
fluoride is actually the best

258
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:37,920
nucleophile, followed by
chloride, followed by bromide,

259
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,420
followed by iodide.

260
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,150
So here, you're going in the
direction of basicity.

261
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,860
This is the best. This is the
worse in an aprotic solvent.

262
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,490
If it was in a protic solvent,
this is flipped around.

263
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,110
This becomes the best and
this becomes the worst.
