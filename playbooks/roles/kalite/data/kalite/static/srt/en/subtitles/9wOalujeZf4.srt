1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,360
So you may or may not already
know that any linear equation

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,300
can be written in the form
y is equal to mx plus b.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,630
Where m is the slope
of the line.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,590
The same slope that we've
been dealing with

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,580
the last few videos.

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,300
The rise over run of the line.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,090
Or the inclination
of the line.

9
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,920
And b is the y-intercept.

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,890
   

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,630
I think it's pretty easy
to verify that b is a

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,310
y-intercept.

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,350
The way you verify that is you
substitute x is equal to 0.

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,590
If you get x is equal to 0--
remember x is equal to 0, that

15
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,580
means that's where we're going
to intercept at the y-axis.

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,630
If x is equal to 0, this
equation becomes y is equal to

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,650
m times 0 plus b.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,430
m times 0 is just
going to be 0.

19
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,520
I don't care what m is.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,620
So then y is going
to be equal to b.

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,075
So the point 0, b is going
to be on that line.

22
00:00:58,075 --> 00:01:00,680
   

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,510
The line will intercept the
y-axis at the point

24
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,540
y is equal to b.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,060
We'll see that with
actual numbers in

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,420
the next few videos.

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,080
Just to verify for you that m
is really the slope, let's

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,310
just try some numbers out.

29
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,840
We know the point 0,
b is on the line.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,465
What happens when
x is equal to 1?

31
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:21,700
   

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,450
You get y is equal
to m times 1.

33
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,210
Or it's equal to m plus b.

34
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:34,200
So we also know that the
point 1, m plus b

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,290
is also on the line.

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:36,490
Right?

37
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,900
This is just the y value.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,770
So what's the slope between
that point and that point?

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,280
Let's take this as the end
point, so you have m plus b,

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,030
our change in y, m plus b minus
b over our change in x,

41
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:59,770
over 1 minus 0.

42
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,740
This is our change in
y over change in x.

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,660
We're using two points.

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,480
That's our end point.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
That's our starting point.

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,100
So if you simplify this,
b minus b is 0.

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,840
1 minus 0 is 1.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,500
So you get m/1, or you
get it's equal to m.

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,510
So hopefully you're satisfied
and hopefully I didn't confuse

50
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,410
you by stating it in the
abstract with all of these

51
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,410
variables here.

52
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,140
But this is definitely going
to be the slope and this is

53
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,580
definitely going to be
the y-intercept.

54
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,360
Now given that, what I want to
do in this exercise is look at

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,890
these graphs and then use the
already drawn graphs to figure

56
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,860
out the equation.

57
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,550
So we're going to look at these,
figure out the slopes,

58
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,650
figure out the y-intercepts and
then know the equation.

59
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:48,440
So let's do this line A first.
So what is A's slope?

60
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,670
Let's start at some
arbitrary point.

61
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,620
Let's start right over there.

62
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,430
We want to get even numbers.

63
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,070
If we run one, two, three.

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,550
So if delta x is equal to 3.

65
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,820
Right?

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,550
One, two, three.

67
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,640
Our delta y-- and I'm just doing
it because I want to hit

68
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,430
an even number here-- our delta
y is equal to-- we go

69
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,330
down by 2-- it's equal
to negative 2.

70
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,790
So for A, change in
y for change in x.

71
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,400
When our change in x is 3, our
change in y is negative 2.

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,860
So our slope is negative 2/3.

73
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,790
When we go over by 3, we're
going to go down by 2.

74
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,920
Or if we go over by 1, we're
going to go down by 2/3.

75
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,790
You can't exactly see it there,
but you definitely see

76
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,800
it when you go over by 3.

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,430
So that's our slope.

78
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,380
We've essentially done
half of that problem.

79
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,280
Now we have to figure
out the y-intercept.

80
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,580
So that right there is our m.

81
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,810
Now what is our b?

82
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,340
Our y-intercept.

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,120
Well where does this intersect
the y-axis?

84
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,260
Well we already said
the slope is 2/3.

85
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,250
So this is the point
y is equal to 2.

86
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,610
When we go over by 1 to the
right, we would have

87
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,880
gone down by 2/3.

88
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,000
So this right here must
be the point 1 1/3.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,370
Or another way to say it,
we could say it's 4/3.

90
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,920
That's the point y
is equal to 4/3.

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,660
Right there.

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,560
A little bit more than 1.

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,269
About 1 1/3.

94
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,029
So we could say b
is equal to 4/3.

95
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,300
So we'll know that the equation
is y is equal to m,

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,850
negative 2/3, x plus
b, plus 4/3.

97
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,590
That's equation A.

98
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,600
Let's do equation B.

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,860
Hopefully we won't have
to deal with as

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,510
many fractions here.

101
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,360
Equation B.

102
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,420
Let's figure out its slope
first. Let's start at some

103
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,830
reasonable point.

104
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,510
We could start at that point.

105
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,650
Let me do it right here.

106
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,380
B.

107
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,030
Equation B.

108
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,100
When our delta x is equal
to-- let me write it

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,960
this way, delta x.

110
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,040
So our delta x could be 1.

111
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,640
When we move over 1 to the
right, what happens

112
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,480
to our delta y?

113
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,270
We go up by 3.

114
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,710
delta x.

115
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,670
delta y.

116
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,140
Our change in y is 3.

117
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,710
So delta y over delta x, When
we go to the right, our

118
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,940
change in x is 1.

119
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,830
Our change in y is positive 3.

120
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,760
So our slope is equal to 3.

121
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,410
What is our y-intercept?

122
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,550
Well, when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 1.

123
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,160
So b is equal to 1.

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,210
So this was a lot easier.

125
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,430
Here the equation is y is
equal to 3x plus 1.

126
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,280
Let's do that last line there.

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:49,100
Line C Let's do the y-intercept
first. You see

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,820
immediately the y-intercept--
when x is equal to 0, y is

129
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,040
negative 2.

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,380
So b is equal to negative 2.

131
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,300
And then what is the slope?

132
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,220
m is equal to change in
y over change in x.

133
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,880
Let's start at that
y-intercept.

134
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,630
If we go over to the right
by one, two, three, four.

135
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,570
So our change in x
is equal to 4.

136
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,380
What is our change in y?

137
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,945
Our change in y is positive 2.

138
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:19,630
   

139
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,780
So change in y is 2 when
change in x is 4.

140
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,390
So the slope is equal
to 1/2, 2/4.

141
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,870
So the equation here is y is
equal to 1/2 x, that's our

142
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,750
slope, minus 2.

143
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,560
And we're done.

144
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Now let's go the other way.

145
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,850
Let's look at some equations of
lines knowing that this is

146
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,900
the slope and this is the
y-intercept-- that's the m,

147
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
that's the b-- and actually
graph them.

148
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,320
Let's do this first line.

149
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,030
I already started circling
it in orange.

150
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,350
The y-intercept is 5.

151
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,800
When x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 5.

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
You can verify that
on the equation.

153
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,920
So when x is equal to 0, y is
equal to one, two, three,

154
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,590
four, five.

155
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,890
That's the y-intercept
and the slope is 2.

156
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,330
That means when I move 1 in the
x-direction, I move up 2

157
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,770
in the y-direction.

158
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,490
If I move 1 in the x-direction,
I move up 2 in

159
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:12,990
the y-direction.

160
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,050
If I move 1 in the x-direction,
I move up 2 in

161
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,320
the y-direction.

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,550
If I move back 1 in the
x-direction, I move down 2 in

163
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,830
the y-direction.

164
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,160
If I move back 1 in the
x-direction, I move down 2 in

165
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,750
the y-direction.

166
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,970
I keep doing that.

167
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,130
So this line is going to look--
I can't draw lines too

168
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,060
neatly, but this is going
to be my best shot.

169
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,240
It's going to look something
like that.

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,100
It'll just keep going on,
on and on and on.

171
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,140
So that's our first line.

172
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,720
I can just keep going
down like that.

173
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,420
Let's do this second line.

174
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,200
y is equal to negative
0.2x plus 7.

175
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,910
Let me write that. y is equal
to negative 0.2x plus 7.

176
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,450
It's always easier to
think in fractions.

177
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,420
So 0.2 is the same
thing as 1/5.

178
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,500
We could write y is equal to
negative 1/5 x plus 7.

179
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
We know it's y-intercept at 7.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,270
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

181
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,100
That's our y-intercept
when x is equal to 0.

182
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,240
This tells us that for every
5 we move to the right,

183
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,120
we move down 1.

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,330
We can view this as
negative 1/5.

185
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,590
The delta y over delta x is
equal to negative 1/5.

186
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,430
For every 5 we move to the
right, we move down 1.

187
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,370
So every 5.

188
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,550
One, two, three, four, five.

189
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,650
We moved 5 to the right.

190
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,169
That means we must
move down 1.

191
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,309
We move 5 to the right.

192
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,690
One, two, three, four, five.

193
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,549
We must move down 1.

194
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,740
If you go backwards, if you move
5 backwards-- instead of

195
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,260
this, if you view this
as 1 over negative 5.

196
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,450
These are obviously equivalent
numbers.

197
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,060
If you go back 5-- that's
negative 5.

198
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,500
One, two, three, four, five.

199
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,805
Then you move up 1.

200
00:08:56,805 --> 00:09:00,050
If you go back 5-- one,
two, three, four,

201
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,830
five-- you move up 1.

202
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,110
So the line is going
to look like this.

203
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,000
I have to just connect
the dots.

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,020
I think you get the idea.

205
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,170
I just have to connect
those dots.

206
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,170
I could've drawn it a little
bit straighter.

207
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,840
Now let's do this one, y
is equal to negative x.

208
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,480
   

209
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,800
Where's the b term?

210
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,940
I don't see any b term.

211
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,490
You remember we're saying
y is equal to mx plus b.

212
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,670
Where is the b?

213
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,780
Well, the b is 0.

214
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,770
You could view this as plus 0.

215
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,290
Here is b is 0.

216
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,710
When x is 0, y is 0.

217
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,080
That's our y-intercept, right
there at the origin.

218
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,490
And then the slope-- once again
you see a negative sign.

219
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,710
You could view that as
negative 1x plus 0.

220
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,200
So slope is negative 1.

221
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,570
When you move to the right by
1, when change in x is 1,

222
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,690
change in y is negative 1.

223
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,320
When you move up by 1 in x,
you go down by 1 in y.

224
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,580
Or if you go down by 1 in x,
you're going to go up by 1 in

225
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,660
y. x and y are going to
have opposite signs.

226
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,850
They go in opposite
directions.

227
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,955
So the line is going
to look like that.

228
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:06,550
You could almost imagine it's
splitting the second and

229
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,240
fourth quadrants.

230
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,980
Now I'll do one more.

231
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,160
Let's do this last
one right here.

232
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,830
y is equal to 3.75.

233
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,610
Now you're saying, gee,
we're looking for y is

234
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,630
equal to mx plus b.

235
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,940
Where is this x term?

236
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,650
It's completely gone.

237
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,980
Well the reality here is, this
could be rewritten as y is

238
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,240
equal to 0x plus 3.75.

239
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Now it makes sense.

240
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,500
The slope is 0.

241
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,020
No matter how much we change
our x, y does not change.

242
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,930
Delta y over delta
x is equal to 0.

243
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,770
I don't care how much
you change your x.

244
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,220
Our y-intercept is 3.75.

245
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,870
So 1, 2, 3.75 is right
around there.

246
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,710
You want to get close.

247
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,990
3 3/4.

248
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,620
As I change x, y will
not change. y is

249
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,570
always going to be 3.75.

250
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,200
It's just going to be
a horizontal line at

251
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,450
y is equal to 3.75.

252
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,600
Anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.

253
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:10,866
