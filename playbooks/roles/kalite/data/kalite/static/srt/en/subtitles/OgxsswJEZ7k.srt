1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,450
We're on problem 173.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,310
The probability is 1/2 that a certain coin will turn up

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,560
heads on any given toss. Fair enough.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,140
If the coin is to be tossed three times,

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,050
what is the probability that on at least one of the tosses

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,660
the coin will turn up tails?

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,580
So probability, at least one tails.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,410
That might seem really hard for you.

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,690
How do I know which tails it is and all of that?

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,800
But let's think about the opposite circumstance.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,180
This is equivalent to saying what is the probability that

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:48,160
I don't get all heads? These are equivalent things.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,880
At least one tails means that I don't get all heads.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,020
What is the probability that I don't get all heads?

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,200
Well, that's 1 minus the probability that I get all heads.

16
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,770
Figuring out the probability that

17
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,180
you get all heads isn't that hard.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,100
Because you have 1/2 probability of heads on the first time,

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,860
times 1/2 probability

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,820
because you have to get a heads on the second time,

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,030
times 1/2 probability because you have to get a heads on

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,020
the third time. That's equal to 1/8.

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,170
So 1 minus 1/8 is equal to, 8/8 minus 1/8,

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,570
which is equal to 7/8. So that is choice D.

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,430
A lot of these probability questions,

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,000
you have to get at least 1 of something.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,910
If you think of it that way, it's very hard.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,360
You'll have to start thinking of combinatorics and binomial

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,000
coefficients and all of that.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,510
But if you just think of the opposite problem,

31
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,100
what would have to be true? That I don't get all heads.

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,750
What's the probability that I do get all heads?

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,560
And then that's a much easier thing to solve for.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,940
You just take that from 1,

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,050
and you get the probability that it doesn't happen.

36
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,080
Next question, 174.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,080
Of the final grades received by the students in a certain

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:11,870
math course, 1/5 are A's, 1/4 are B's, 1/2 are C's,

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,880
and the remaining 10 grades are D's.

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,020
What's the number of the students in the course?

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,240
So if we know what fraction 10 is,

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,550
then we know the number of students in the course.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,210
So, essentially, what do these fractions add up to?

44
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,000
So let's find a common denominator.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,030
Looks like a common denominator between 4, 5, and 2 is 20.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,330
So, 1/5 get A's. So that's four 20's plus 1/4.

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,180
So, that's five 20's plus one 1/2. That's ten 20's.

48
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,670
So the A's, B's, and C's are equal to-- what is this?

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,050
4 plus 5 is 9 plus 10 is equal to 19/20 of the class.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,130
They're saying that the remaining 10 grades are D's.

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,400
So there are no F's in this class.

52
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,620
So the remaining grades, that's 1/20 of the class.

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,920
So that's equal to 1/20. Right?

54
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,580
Because if the A's, B's and C's are 19/20, and all the other

55
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,760
grades are D's, then all the other grades are going to

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,770
be 1/20 of the class because that's what's left over.

57
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,830
So if I say 1/20 of the class is equal to 10,

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,750
multiply both sides by 20.

59
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,600
You get the class is equal to 200 students. That's choice D.

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,750
Next question, 175.

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,360
As x increases from 165 to 166,

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,940
which of the following must increase?

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Interesting. So 1, 2x minus 5.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,660
Well sure, as I go from 2 times 165 to 2 times 166,

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,420
this is obviously going to increase,

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,900
and this is going to stay the same.

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,200
So this is going to increase.

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,770
You can substitute the numbers in there if you don't believe

69
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,670
me, but I think that should make some intuition.

70
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:25,070
Statement 2,1 minus 1 over x. So,1/165 is greater than 1/166.

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,490
This is a larger fraction than that is.

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,100
1 over 1 million is much smaller than 1/2.

73
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,620
So 1/65 is greater than 1/66.

74
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,250
So you might say, as I go from 165 to 166,

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,280
this term right here gets smaller. Right?

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,620
That term does get smaller. But we're subtracting that term.

77
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,810
So if we're subtracting a term that's getting smaller,

78
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,770
the whole value is actually going to get larger.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,020
We're subtracting a smaller number as we go to 166.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,600
1 minus 1/166 is a larger number than 1 minus 1/165.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,880
So this, also, gets larger.

82
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:20,910
Statement 3, 1 over x squared minus x. So the question is,

83
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,090
what happens to x squared minus x as we go from 165 to 166?

84
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,470
If you think about it, we are well beyond any type of

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,450
x squared, any kind of vertex in this.

86
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,590
If you know a little bit of calculus,

87
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,230
you could figure out the vertex really fast.

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,440
So, this is going to be some type of a parabola.

89
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,080
This x squared minus x is going to look something like this.

90
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,690
Right? Its vertex is actually-- 2x minus 1 is equal to 0--

91
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,240
its vertex is at x is equal to 1/2. It's a very small number.

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,020
So we're in the point of this curve that's increasing upwards

93
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,130
Right? So when we go from 165 to 166,

94
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,200
this right here is definitely increasing. This

95
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,010
denominator is definitely going to increase from 165 to 166.

96
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,470
You might say, we're going to be subtracting a larger number.

97
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,010
But that's more than offset by squaring the larger number.

98
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,180
So this denominator is going to increase.

99
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,270
But if the denominator is increasing,then the whole fraction,

100
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,470
which is the inverse of the denominator,

101
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,040
that's going to decrease. So this one is not increasing.

102
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,620
So, 1 and 2 only. So that's C.

103
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,870
Next question, 176. I'll do it in a different color.

104
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,700
A rectangular box is 10 inches wide, 10 inches long,

105
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,750
and 5 inches high.

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,490
So, it's 10 inches, 10 inches, and then 5 high.

107
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,410
Fair enough. That's the box.

108
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,910
What is the greatest possible distance in inches between

109
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,000
any two points on the box? So, this is a bit of an old trick.

110
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,980
So, the longest distance in this box is kind of

111
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,040
a three-dimensional diagonal.

112
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:12,280
So, a normal diagonal goes along one surface.

113
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,430
But if you go from this point back here-- and I'll do that

114
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,010
in a different color-- to this point over here,

115
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,080
that's the longest dimension in the box.

116
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,810
If you know how to figure out distance in three dimensions,

117
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,670
then that's all you really need to know how to do.

118
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,950
It's going to be the square root of 10 squared plus 10

119
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,590
squared plus 5 squared. So that's the fast way to do it.

120
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,150
I'll show you the logic of it in a second.

121
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,790
So, 10 squared plus 10 squared plus 5 squared.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,590
If we had a fourth dimension, which is hard to visualize,

123
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,680
we would at that distance squared and

124
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,770
take the square root of everything.

125
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is equal to the square root of what? 100 200 25

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,060
225, which is equal to 15. That's choice A.

127
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,020
Let me give you the logic.

128
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,180
So if I'm taking the distance from this point to this point,

129
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,000
how do we figure that out?

130
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,300
Well let's see, the easiest way to think about it is can

131
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:11,000
we figure out this distance right here?

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,770
So this is going along the top of the box.

133
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,720
Let me do that in the magenta.

134
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,470
Well sure, if we look at the box straight down,

135
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,870
what I just drew-- if this is 10 and 10--

136
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,890
what I just drew goes like that. Right?

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's going along the top of the box.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,500
So, this is going to be the square root of 100 squared, the

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,470
square root of 10 squared plus the square root of 10 squared.

140
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,690
So, this just the Pythagorean theorem.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,060
This distance right here is the square root of 200.

142
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,790
I just used the Pythagorean theorem.

143
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,990
I just said this is 10, this is 10,

144
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,830
so this has to be the square root of 200.

145
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,010
Now we have to do a little bit of visualization.

146
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,850
To figure out that green line that's the longest diagonal in

147
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,820
this box, think about it this way.

148
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,080
We still have a right triangle although maybe it's a little

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,380
harder to visualize. Well, maybe it isn't.

150
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,910
So, the right triangle looks like this,

151
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,030
where the side is the square root of 200,that's this up here.

152
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,890
This side right here is 5. They tell us that.

153
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,570
So the side right here is 5.

154
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,000
Then the diagonal that we're trying to solve for is in green.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,790
That's the longest diagonal.

156
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,320
Remember this line is the same thing,if you view from the top

157
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,690
as this line. It's just that you can't see what's below it.

158
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,670
So here we just use the Pythagorean theorem.

159
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,880
So, we could say c squared-- let's call this c--

160
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,010
is equal to 25 plus this squared plus 200.

161
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,460
Then you get to the same answer that we just got to.

162
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,060
So c is equal to the square root of 225,

163
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,930
which is equal to 15. What problem was I on?

164
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,400
That was choice A if I haven't already said it.

165
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,050
Anyway. See you in the next video.
