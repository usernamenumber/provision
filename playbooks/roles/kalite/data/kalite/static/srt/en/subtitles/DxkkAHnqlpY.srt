1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,200
In the videos on massive stars and on black holes, we learned that if the remnant of a massive star is

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,800
massive enough, the gravitational contraction, the gravitational force, will be stronger than even the

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,898
electron degeneracy pressure, even stronger than the neutron degeneracy pressure,

4
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:23,067
even stronger than the quark degeneracy pressure,

5
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,400
and everything would collapse into a point.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,979
And we called these points "black holes".

7
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,056
And we learned there is an event horizon around these black holes.

8
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:40,067
And if anything gets closer or goes within the boundary of that event horizon,

9
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:44,046
there is no way that it can ever escape from the black hole.

10
00:00:44,046 --> 00:00:46,325
All it can do is get closer and closer to the black hole.

11
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:49,067
And that includes light, and that's why it's called a black hole.

12
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:54,079
So, even though all of the mass is at the central point, this entire area,

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:02,933
or the entire surface of the event horizon -- I'll do it in purple, although it's supposed to be black --

14
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:08,533
This entire surface will appear black. It will emit no light.

15
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,364
Now, these type of black holes that we described,

16
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:16,101
we call those stellar black holes.

17
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:21,200
And that is because they are formed from collapsing massive stars.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,933
And the largest stellar black holes that we have observed are on the order of 33 solar masses, give or take.

19
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,287
So, very massive to begin with, lets just be clear.

20
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:35,800
And this is what the remnant of the star has to be.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:43,333
So a lot more of the original star's mass might have been pushed off in supernovae (the plural of supernova).

22
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,833
Now, there is another class of black holes here, and they are somewhat mysterious.

23
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:57,133
They are called supermassive black holes.

24
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:02,467
To some degree the word super isn't big enough.

25
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,933
They are not just a little bit more massive than stellar black holes --

26
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:07,826
they are a lot more massive.

27
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:18,033
They are on the order of hundreds of thousands to billions

28
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,877
of solar masses.

29
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:25,333
A hundred thousand to billions of times the mass of our sun.

30
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,747
And what's interesting about these, other than the fact that they're super-huge,

31
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:31,867
is that there doesn't seem to be black holes in between.

32
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,200
Or at least we haven't observed black holes in between.

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,667
The largest stellar black hole is thirty-three solar masses.

34
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:40,667
And then there are these supermassive black holes that we think exist.

35
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,321
And we think they mainly exist in the centers of galaxies.

36
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,267
And we think most, if not all, centers of galaxies

37
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,513
actually have one of these supermassive black holes.

38
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,176
But it's kind of an interesting question:

39
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:57,667
If all black holes were formed from collapsing stars, wouldn't we see things in between?

40
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,267
So one theory of how these really massive black holes form

41
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,282
is that you have a regular stellar black hole

42
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:08,085
in an area that has a lot of matter than can accrete around it,

43
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:10,538
(So let's imagine you have a regular . . .

44
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:13,593
So I'll draw the event horizon around it.

45
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,954
The actual black hole's going to be in the center of that,

46
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:18,025
or the mass of the black hole will be in the center of it.)

47
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,267
And then over time you just have

48
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:24,067
more and more mass just falling into this black hole.

49
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,936
Just more and more stuff just keeps falling into this black hole,

50
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:31,067
and then it just keeps growing.

51
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,867
And so this could be a plausible reason . . .

52
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,899
Or at least the mass in the center keeps growing,

53
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,333
and so the event horizon will also keep growing in radius.

54
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,933
Now, this is a plausible explanation based on our current understanding.

55
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,535
But the reason why this one doesn't gel that well is

56
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:49,400
if this was the explanation for supermassive black holes,

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,576
you would expect to see more black holes in between --

58
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:57,819
maybe black holes with a hundred solar masses, or a thousand solar masses, or ten thousand solar masses.

59
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,667
But we're not seeing those right now;

60
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,133
We just see the stellar black holes and we see the supermassive black holes.

61
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,667
So another possible explanation --

62
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:11,402
my inclination is leaning towards this one because it kind of explains the gap --

63
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:14,142
is that these supermassive black holes

64
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:19,642
actually formed shortly after the Big Bang, that these are primordial black holes.

65
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:26,877
These started near the beginning of our universe.

66
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:29,415
Now remember, what do you need to have a black hole?

67
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:33,945
You need to have an amazingly dense amount of matter,

68
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,421
or a dense amount of mass.

69
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:38,895
If you have a lot of mass in a very small volume,

70
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:43,133
then the gravitational pull will pull them closer and closer together,

71
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:47,000
and they'll be able to overcome all of the

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,689
electron degeneracy pressures, and the neutron degeneracy pressures, and the quark degeneracy pressures

73
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,400
to really collapse into what we think is a single point.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,733
I want to be clear here too.

75
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,292
We don't know it's single point;

76
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,729
we've never gone into the center of a black hole.

77
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,667
Just the mathmetics of the black hole --

78
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,274
or at least as we understand it right now --

79
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:09,104
have everything colliding into a single point where the math starts to break down.

80
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:10,467
So we're really not sure

81
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,933
what happens at that very small center point.

82
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,067
But needless to say, it will be an unbelievably --

83
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:21,267
maybe infinite, maybe almost infitely dense point in space

84
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,533
or dense amount of matter.

85
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,000
And the reason why I kind of favor this primordial black hole,

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
and why this would make sense,

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,667
is right after the formation of the universe,

88
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:35,333
all the matter in the universe was in a much denser space

89
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,736
because the universe was smaller.

90
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,895
So let's say this is right after the Big Bang,

91
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:41,600
some period of time after the big bang.

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,533
Now, what we've talked about before when we talked about cosmic background radiation

93
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,974
is at that point, the universe was relatively uniform.

94
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:53,222
It was super, super dense, but it was relatively uniform.

95
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,333
So in a universe like this,

96
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,656
there's no reason why anything would collapse into black holes

97
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,548
because if you look at a point here,

98
00:05:59,548 --> 00:06:04,333
sure, there's a ton of mass close to it, but it's very close to it in every direction.

99
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,267
So it would be pulled . . .

100
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:07,285
the gravitational force would be the same in every direction,

101
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:11,566
if it was completely uniform.

102
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,267
but if you go shortly after the Big Bang --

103
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,733
maybe because of slight quantum fluctuaion effects --

104
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,044
it becomes slightly non-uniform.

105
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,267
So let's say it becomes slightly non-uniform.

106
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:24,867
But it still is unbelievably dense.

107
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,933
So let's say it looks something like this,

108
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:32,400
where you have areas that are denser, but it's slightly non-uniform.

109
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,645
But extremely dense.

110
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,133
So here, all of a sudden, you have the type of densities

111
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,333
necessary for a black hole,

112
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,667
and where you have higher densities, where it's less uniform,

113
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:47,115
here all of a sudden, you will have inward force.

114
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,733
The gravitational pull from things outside of this area

115
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,267
is going to be less than the gravitational pull towads those areas.

116
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:59,200
And the more things get pulled towards it, the less uniform it's going to get.

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,348
So you can imagine, in that primordial universe,

118
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,533
very shortly after the Big Bang,

119
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:07,800
when things were very dense and closely packed together,

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,467
we may -- we may -- have had the conditions

121
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:13,733
where these supermassive black holes could have formed,

122
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,280
where you had so much mass in such a small volume,

123
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,467
and it was just not-uniform enough so that you could have this snowballing effect,

124
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:29,600
so that more and more mass would collect into these supermassive black holes

125
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,509
that are hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of the sun.

126
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,800
And -- this is the even more interesting part --

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,568
those black holes would become the centers of future galaxies.

128
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:45,933
So you have these black holes forming, these supermassive black holes forming.

129
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:49,000
And not everything would go into a black hole;

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
only if it didn't have a lot of angular velocity, it might go into the black hole.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,752
But if it's going past it fast enough,

132
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:59,167
it'll just start going in orbit around the black hole.

133
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:02,000
And so you can imagine that this is how the early galaxies,

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,672
or even our galaxy formed.

135
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:05,000
And so you might be wondering,

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,830
"Well, what about the black hole at the center of the Milky Way?"

137
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,498
We think there is one.

138
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:14,585
We think there is one because we've observed stars orbiting very quickly

139
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:24,267
around something at the center of our Milky Way.

140
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,893
And the only plausible explanation

141
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:29,400
for things orbitting so quickly around something

142
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,975
is that it has to have a density of either a black hole,

143
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:36,200
or something that will eventually turn into a black hole.

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,600
And when you do the math,

145
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,568
for the middle of our Galaxy, the center of the Milky Way,

146
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:47,456
our supermassive black hole is on the order of four million times the mass

147
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:50,667
of the sun.

148
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,735
So hopefully that give you a little food for thought.

149
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,667
There aren't just only stellar collapsed black holes.

150
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,667
Or maybe there are,

151
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,267
and maybe they somehow grow into supermassive black holes,

152
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:00,067
and everything in between we just can't observe.

153
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,867
Or that they really are a different class of black holes.

154
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,200
They're actually formed different ways.

155
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Maybe they formed near the beginning of the actual universe.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,933
When the density of things was a little un-uniform,

157
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,000
things condensed into each other.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,562
And what we're going to talk about in the next video is

159
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:17,867
how these supermassive black holes could help generate

160
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:21,876
unbelievable sources of radiation,

161
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:25,000
even though the black holes themselves aren't emitting them.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,911
And those are going to be quasars.
