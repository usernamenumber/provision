1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,655
Let's do some equations of lines
in point-slope form.

3
00:00:04,655 --> 00:00:07,540
   

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,645
And this is different from y or
from slope-intercept form.

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,650
   

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,200
But they really are just two
different ways of writing the

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,330
same equation.

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,220
We'll see that with a
couple of examples.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,450
And you might remember that
slope-intercept form were

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,030
equations of the form, y is
equal to mx plus b-- we did

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,280
this in the last video-- where
m is the slope, b is the

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,850
intercept, the y-intercept.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,060
That's why it's called
slope-intercept.

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,320
You have the slope and
the intercept.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,650
In point-slope form, it takes
the form y minus y1-- and I'll

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,680
tell you what y1 is in a
second-- is equal to m times x

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:00,590
minus x1, where the coordinate
x1, y1 is a point on the line.

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,530
That's why this is called
point-slope form.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,440
Now, these are just two
different ways of writing the

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,520
exact same thing.

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,960
You can always algebraically
manipulate this to get that,

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,870
or algebraically manipulate
that to get that.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,800
And I'll show you that with
a couple of examples.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,960
But let's just do a few in
point-slope form, just to make

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,140
things concrete in your head.

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,030
So here we have a line that has
a slope of negative 1 over

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,160
10, so m is equal to
negative 1 over 10.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,460
And it goes through the
point 10 comma 2.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,320
So we can directly go
to point-slope form.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,430
So let's get a point.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,470
A point here is the
point 10 comma 2.

32
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,470
So we can immediately go to
point-slope form. y minus,

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,730
this is a y-value that's
on the line.

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:53,730
So y minus 2 is going to be
equal to the slope, negative 1

35
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:01,530
over 10 times x minus an
x-value, times x minus 10,

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,020
just like that.

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,780
And we're done.

38
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,650
We just put it in point-slope
form.

39
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,410
There's two things I want
to point out to you.

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,610
One, why this makes sense.

41
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,150
And I also want to show
you that this is

42
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,300
equivalent to that.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,910
So the first thing is why
does this make sense?

44
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,920
Well, all this is saying, if you
divide both sides of this

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,710
equation by that right over
there, you get y2 over x minus

46
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,880
10 is equal to negative
1 over 10.

47
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,540
Or you get the change in y
between any point and 2, and

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,380
the point 2, over
the change in x.

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,400
So you get the change in y over
the change in x for any

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,200
point x, y on that line,
relative to the point 10 comma

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,690
2, is going to be negative
1 over 10.

52
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,370
This is just the definition
of your slope.

53
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,580
Hopefully I don't confuse
you there.

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,720
I'm just showing you that this
is just using the definition

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,190
of the slope to create the
equation of the line.

56
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,140
Now, the other thing I want
to show is that this is

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,100
completely equivalent to this.

58
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,110
We can just algebraically
manipulate this to get that.

59
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,060
And let's do that.

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,280
So this right here is the
answer to the problem.

61
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,340
But let's play around with
it algebraically to

62
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,780
get it in that form.

63
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,170
So if we get y minus 2 is equal
to-- let's distribute

64
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,720
the negative 1 over 10.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
So it's negative 1 over 10 x,
and then negative 1 over 10

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,020
times negative 10 is plus 1.

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,990
Now we can add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

68
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:34,850
And you get y is equal to
negative 1 over 10 x plus 3.

69
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,370
So just algebraically
manipulating it, we were able

70
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,830
to put it into slope-intercept
form.

71
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,750
So these two things are
completely equivalent.

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,680
Let's do a couple more problems.
The line contains

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,630
the points 10 comma
12 and 5, 25.

74
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,040
So let's figure out the slope.

75
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,060
So the slope, which is equal to
change in y over change in

76
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,000
x, is equal to-- well, let's
just use this point first. So

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:19,870
let's say it's 12 minus
25 over 10 minus 5.

78
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,760
This is going to be equal to--
12 minus 25 is negative 13,

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,530
over 10 minus 5, which is 5.

80
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,270
So the slope here is
negative 13 over 5.

81
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,980
Let's put it in point-slope
form, the equation.

82
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,040
So it's going to be y minus--
let's use this point right

83
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,440
here-- y minus 25 is equal to
the slope negative 13 over 5

84
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,690
times x minus this point, 5.

85
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,350
We just knew that the point
5 comma 25 is on the line.

86
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,890
So y minus 25 is equal to the
slope, which we figured out,

87
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,850
times x minus 5.

88
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,060
And we're done.

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,650
That's all.

90
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,580
If you want, out of interest,
you could do the algebra to

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,470
put this into the
slope-intercept form, to the

92
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,930
mx plus b form, and see that
they are completely

93
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,460
equivalent.

94
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,770
Let's do another one.

95
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,050
So they gave us our slope.

96
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,700
It's 3/5, and the y-intercept
is negative 3.

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,945
So here, immediately, this would
be very easy to put it

98
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:27,420
in the slope-intercept form.

99
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:35,020
   

100
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,650
The equation of this line is y
is equal to the slope 3/5x,

101
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,200
plus the y-intercept, minus 3.

102
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,070
And we'd be done.

103
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,590
But how do you put this
into point-slope form?

104
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,190
   

105
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,830
Well, we know the slope.

106
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,950
We know that m is
equal to 3/5.

107
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,670
   

108
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,750
But do we know any points
on this line?

109
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,150
You need a point and a slope
to immediately put it into

110
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,660
point-slope form.

111
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,180
Well, we know one point.

112
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,300
We know the y-intercept.

113
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,150
The y-intercept is negative 3.

114
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,420
That means when x is equal to
0, y is equal to negative 3.

115
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,520
So our point is, the point
0, negative 3.

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
You could have tried to figure
out other points.

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,450
You could have said, oh,
when x is equal to 5,

118
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,500
y is equal to 0.

119
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,090
There's all sorts of things
you could've tried out.

120
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,500
But this one was just sitting
there for us.

121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,840
The y-intercept is negative 3.

122
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,640
That means that the point 0,
minus 3 is on the line.

123
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,180
So let's write it in
point-slope form.

124
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:42,150
y minus this y-value, so y minus
negative 3, is equal to

125
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,080
the slope 3/5 times x minus
this x-value, this

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,000
x-coordinate, x minus 0.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,420
And this is point-slope form.

128
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,810
This could be y plus 3 is equal
to 3/5 times-- we could

129
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,200
write times x minus 0.

130
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,610
If you really wanted to make it
look like point-slope form,

131
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,510
this would be point-slope form,
but it's kind of silly

132
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,080
to write x minus 0.

133
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,936
So you could just write y
plus 3 is equal to 3/5x.

134
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:13,290
   

135
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,380
It's not 100% clear that
you're in point-slope

136
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,230
form yet right now.

137
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,480
But I think you still need
to write x minus 0.

138
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,870
And obviously, to go from here
to there, you just have to

139
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,110
subtract 3 from both sides
and you'll get that.

140
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,920
So these are almost
equivalent.

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,720
I mean, they are equivalent in
terms of what they represent.

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,750
They're even almost equivalent
in how you write them.

143
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,300
You just have to subtract 3
from both sides of this

144
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,350
equation to get to that one.

145
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,770
Let's do another one.

146
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,260
Let's put this in point-slope
form.

147
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,880
They're giving us information.

148
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,570
They're giving it in the
form of x, f of x.

149
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,680
So in this situation, when
x is negative 7, f of

150
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,860
x is equal to 5.

151
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,580
And this coordinate, they're
telling us when x is equal to

152
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,810
3, f of x is equal
to negative 4.

153
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,220
So just like that, we can figure
out the slope first. So

154
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,895
the slope, which is equal change
in y over change in x.

155
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:15,950
So let's do this.

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:29,130
It's negative 4 minus 5, over
3 minus negative 7.

157
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,900
And this is going to be equal
to-- negative 4 minus 5 is

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,460
negative 9.

159
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,299
And then 3 minus negative 7,
that's the same thing as 3

160
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,049
plus 7, that's 10.

161
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,870
So slope is negative 9/10.

162
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,830
And so to put this
in point-slope

163
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,083
form is really easy.

164
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:52,000
   

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,710
It's just going to be y--
let's do it this way-- y

166
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,770
minus-- I'll color code it-- 3
is equal to-- I'll do this

167
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,480
back to the green color-- is
equal to the slope, is equal

168
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:16,415
to negative 9 over 10, times
this x minus this coordinate,

169
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:20,180
x minus negative 4.

170
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,090
Then we can close it.

171
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,560
So this is in point-slope
form.

172
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,050
We obviously can simplify this
negative a little bit.

173
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,210
We can rewrite it as y minus
3 is equal to negative 9/10

174
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,330
times x, plus 4.

175
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,340
And we are done.

176
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,000
