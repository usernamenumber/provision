1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,540
We're on problem 16.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,225
They draw the axes.

4
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:10,880
x-axis, that's the y-axis.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,250
I wish there was the parabola
drawing tool

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,430
here, but there isn't.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,240
There's the parabola, it looks
something like this.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,750
   

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,840
They tell us that this
is the point 1.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,450
Fair enough.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,460
This is, of course, the y-axis,
this is the x-axis.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,870
The figure above show that the
graph of a quadratic function

13
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,000
h who's maximum value
is h of 2.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,560
So this is its maximum
value right here.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,760
When x is equal to 2, its
maximum is h of 2.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,350
   

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:51,510
If h of a is equal to 0--
so where does this

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,400
function equal 0?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,630
It equals 0 two places.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,540
Here and here, right?

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,950
Its y value is 0 in
those two places.

22
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,610
So this could be a or that could
be a, we don't know.

23
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,150
Which of the following
could be a?

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,050
So we're saying this could
be a or this could

25
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,420
be a, we don't know.

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,780
And we know that this is 2,
so a is either going to be

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,260
greater than 2 or less than 0.

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,340
Or actually, we can actually
figure out what a is, right?

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,620
Because if this is the maximum
point, it's going to be

30
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,070
symmetric around the point 2.

31
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,990
So the distance from 2 to a on
this side has to be the same

32
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,810
as the distance from 2 to a on
this one-- Actually that

33
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,740
doesn't help.

34
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,960
So let's look at the choices.

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,040
It could be negative 1--
that looks fair because

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,060
it's less than 0.

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,290
a can't be 0-- 0
is this point.

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,990
Let me pick a color.

39
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,840
That's 0.

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,330
That's definitely not where you
inter-- they draw it so

41
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,710
that you can't be there.

42
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,120
It can't be 2 because that's
actually where the maximum

43
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,800
point is, so a definitely
isn't 2.

44
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,730
Can a be 3?

45
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,280
And this is where the symmetry
comes into play.

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,220
We know that it does not
intersect the x-axis for at

47
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,850
least-- on the left-hand side
you go 1, 2, and then some

48
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,250
distance which we don't really
know, but you're going more

49
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,930
than 2 on this side.

50
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,060
So you're also going
to have to go more

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,760
than two on this side.

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,140
You're going to have to go 1,
2, and then some distance.

53
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,860
So this is 2, 3, 4.

54
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,940
So you know that a has to be
less than 0, or a has to be

55
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,430
greater than 4.

56
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,550
And if you look at all of the
choices, the only-- negative 1

57
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,500
is less than 0.

58
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,880
None of the other ones
are greater than 4.

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,020
And how did I know
greater than 4?

60
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,440
Because it's symmetric.

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,190
If this is the maximum point
at 2, and one of the places

62
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,660
where I intersect the x-axis
is more than 2 to the left,

63
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,050
the other place where I
intersect the x-axis has to be

64
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,380
more than 2 to the right.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,860
So it has to be greater
than 4.

66
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,850
This has to be less than 0, this
has to be greater than 4.

67
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,480
And that's the answer.

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,120
Negative 1.

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,770
Next problem.

70
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,750
And you really didn't have to--
once you felt comfortable

71
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,330
with negative 1 you could have
just said well that's the

72
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,970
answer because it can very
easily have intersected the

73
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,400
x-axis at x equals negative 1.

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,490
Problem 17-- and that was the
first choice, which tends to

75
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:08,900
be convenient.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,330
Let me get a brighter color.

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:11,850
Problem 17.

78
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,870
If k and h are constants and
x squared plus kx plus 7 is

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:28,100
equivalent to, equals, x plus 1
times x plus h, what is the

80
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,500
value of k?

81
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,330
Well at first sight it doesn't
seem like we could solve this,

82
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,950
but maybe we can, let's try.

83
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:45,470
x squared plus kx plus 7 is
equal to x squared plus x

84
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:52,800
plus hx plus h.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,100
And so this equals x squared.

86
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,350
What's 1x-- right, x is
the same thing as 1x--

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,420
what's 1x plus xh?

88
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:08,810
Well that's 1 plus hx plus h,
right, I just combined these

89
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,610
two terms, added their
coefficients.

90
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,780
And we say x squared plus kx
plus-- oh, well actually,

91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,209
maybe we can solve this because
we can just match up

92
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:26,840
terms. We say this term matches
up to this term.

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,130
This term matches
up to that term.

94
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,590
So we know, h is equal to 7.

95
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,790
And if h is equal to 7, what
is this term equal to?

96
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,860
That term is going to be
equal to 7 plus 1 is 8.

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,570
And this term, what does
this term match up to?

98
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,270
It matches up to this.

99
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,970
We're just kind of matching
coefficients.

100
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,870
If this is 8 than
k is equal to 8.

101
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,650
And that's choice D.

102
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,430
At first I was like how am
I going to solve this?

103
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,710
That's why you should always
just move forward and see if

104
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,340
you see any patterns.

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,590
Next problem.

106
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,490
   

107
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:22,530
Problem 18.

108
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,590
y, x, and then they
draw a line here,

109
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,840
something like that.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,610
   

111
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:45,440
You go from A to C-- oh, the
line keeps going, and then

112
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,010
there's the point up here,
which is the point

113
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,510
here, this is 4,10.

114
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,740
So this is 10 and this is 4.

115
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,080
This is A, B, C.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,700
In the figure above if the
legs of triangle ABC are

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,540
parallel to the axes-- this is
parallel to that, this is

118
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,620
parallel to that, so this is
going to be a right angle.

119
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,950
Which of the following could
be the lengths of

120
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,230
the sides of ABC.

121
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,110
Interesting.

122
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,200
So this is really just a slope
problem because what they want

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,990
you do is figure out the ratio
of this side to this side.

124
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,270
So what is the slope
of this line?

125
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:33,470
Well it rose 10-- change in y
over change in x is equal to

126
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,520
10 minus 0, which is 10 over
4 minus 0, which is 4.

127
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,300
That equals 5 over 2.

128
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,640
So for every one it moved
to the right, it's going

129
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,030
to go 5 over 2 up.

130
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,220
So if this is x, this is
going to be 5 over 2x.

131
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,120
   

132
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,510
So first we should look for--
the two shorter sides are

133
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,000
going to have this ratio.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,030
1 to 5 over 2.

135
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,000
So if you look at the first
choice, choice A, 2 and 5, if

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,760
this is 2, if x is equal to 2,
then what's 2 times 5 or 2?

137
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,210
Well this will be 5, right?

138
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,370
That'll be 5.

139
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,240
So that satisfies that ratio.

140
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,300
And you could even figure out
rise is 5 when run is 2, which

141
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,870
is the slope of 5 over 2.

142
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,400
Now you just have to confirm
that they gave the right

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,960
length for this longer side.

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,830
So we just us Pythagorean
Theorem.

145
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,050
The length of that side's going
to be the square root of

146
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,490
this squared plus
this squared.

147
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,980
The square root of 4 plus
25, which equals the

148
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,310
square root of 29.

149
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,370
So the sides could be
2, 5 squared to 29.

150
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,270
And that is choice A.

151
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,405
Choice B has 2 and 5, but then
it gives 7, assuming that you

152
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,360
didn't know how to do the
Pythagorean Theorem.

153
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,610
Next problem.

154
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,000
   

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,760
Problem 19.

156
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:00,140
Let f be defined by f of x
is equal to 2x minus 1.

157
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:08,020
If 1/2 times f of the square
root of t is equal to 4, what

158
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,200
is the value of t?

159
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,490
So let's just evaluate
this expression.

160
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,620
So it's 1/2 times what?

161
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,265
f of the square root of t-- so
everywhere we see x we stick

162
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,870
in a square root of t.

163
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,570
So 1/2-- that 1/2 is
just this 1/2.

164
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,960
f of the square root of t
is 2 times the square

165
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,570
root of t minus 1.

166
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,040
I just replaced x with
the square root of t.

167
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,930
And we know that
this equals 4.

168
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,280
Let's multiply both sides by 1/2
and you get-- or multiply

169
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,510
both sides by 2-- the 1/2
gets canceled out here.

170
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,429
So you get 2 square root of
t minus 1 is equal to 8.

171
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,480
And you get 2 square root of 5,
adding 1 to both sides is

172
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,420
equal to 9.

173
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,010
Let me continue it here.

174
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,960
Divide both sides by 2 you get
the square root of t is equal

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,140
to 9 over 2.

176
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,130
And now we can square
both sides of this.

177
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,220
So you get t is equal to--
what's 9 over 2 squared?

178
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,910
It's 81 over 4, and
that is choice E.

179
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,130
   

180
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,610
And then let's see
if I have time.

181
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,520
I have 50 seconds.

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,040
Let me see if I can squeeze
in video 20 in here.

183
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,450
If k is a positive integer,
which of the following must

184
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,330
represent an even integer
that is twice the

185
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,260
value of an odd integer.

186
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,580
   

187
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,840
So k is any positive integer.

188
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,060
So I want an even number
that is twice the

189
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,930
value of an odd integer.

190
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,920
So an odd integer-- if this is
any integer, an odd integer

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,080
can be represented this--
2 times k plus 1.

192
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,970
This is definitely going
to be odd integer.

193
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,580
You can try it out with
k is 1, 2 or 3.

194
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,840
So if I want double this,
I just multiply it by 2,

195
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,110
I get 4k plus 2.

196
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,590
And that is choice E.

197
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,330
And you could try it out
with some numbers.

198
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,380
You just have to take my word
that that has to be an odd

199
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,550
integer and then
you double it.

200
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,350
I'll see you in the
next section.

201
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,800
