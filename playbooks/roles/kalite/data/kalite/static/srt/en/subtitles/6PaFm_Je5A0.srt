1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,110
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:06,800
So where I left off, we said
that we had this, I guess you

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,450
could call it, equation or this
function, although I didn't

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,110
write it with the function
notation, where I said, the

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,540
distance is equal to 16 t
squared, and I graphed it, it's

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,100
like a parabola, right,
for positive time.

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,960
And then we said, well, the
velocity, if we know the

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,190
distance, the velocity is just
the change of the distance

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,360
with respect to time.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,080
It's just, the velocity is
always changing, you can't

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,560
just take the slope, you
actually have to take

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,920
the derivative, right?

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,760
So we took the derivative with
respect to time of this

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,915
function, or this equation, and
we got 32t, and this

16
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:33,210
is the velocity.

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,060
And then we graphed it.

18
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,130
And then I asked a question.

19
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,160
I was like, well, we want to
figure out, if we were given

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:47,080
this, if we were given just
this, and I asked you, what is

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,920
the distance that this object
travels after time, you

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,130
know, after 10 seconds?

23
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,240
Let's, you know, let's say this
t0 is equal to 10 seconds.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,150
I want to know how far is this
thing gone after 10 seconds.

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,450
And let's say you didn't know
that you could just take the

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,605
antiderivative, let's say we
didn't know this at all, and

27
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,840
let's say you didn't know that
you could just take the

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,860
antiderivative, because we just
showed that, you know, the

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,990
derivative of distance is
velocity, so the antiderivative

30
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,670
of velocity is distance.

31
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,700
So let's say you couldn't just
take the antiderivative.

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,140
What's a way that you could
start to try to approximate

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,780
how far you've traveled
after, say, 10 seconds?

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,330
Well [? as I said, ?]

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,520
you graph this, and you say,
let's assume over some

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,580
change in time, velocity is
roughly constant, right?

37
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,390
Let's say velocity
is right here.

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,370
So you could approximate how
far you travel over that small

39
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,020
change in time by multiplying
that change in time, let's say

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,900
that's like, you know, a
millionth of a second, times

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,940
the velocity at roughly that
time, or maybe even the average

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,940
velocity over that time, and
you'd get the distance you've

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,390
traveled over that very small
fraction of time, right?

44
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,770
But if you look at it visually,
that also happens to be the

45
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,470
area of this rectangle, right?

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,320
And what we said, is if you
want to know how far you travel

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,160
after 10 seconds, you just draw
a bunch of these rectangles,

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,520
and you sum up the area, right?

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,550
And you could imagine, and you
don't have to imagine, it's

50
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,380
actually true, the smaller the
bases of these rectangles, and

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,610
the more of these rectangles
you have, the more accurate

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,840
your approximation will be,
and you'll approach 2 things.

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,640
You'll approach the area under
this curve, right, almost the

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,740
exact area under this curve,
and you'd also get almost the

55
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:47,030
exact value of the distance
after, say, 10 seconds

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,130
in this case, right?

57
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,100
But 10 didn't have to
be an exact number.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,290
It could have been a variable.

59
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,310
So this is something
pretty interesting.

60
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,100
All of a sudden, we see
that the antiderivative

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,450
is pretty darn similar to
the area under the curve.

62
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,800
And it actually turns out
that they're the same thing.

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,600
And this is where I'm
going to teach you the

64
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,930
indefinite integral.

65
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,860
So the indefinite integral, I
don't know how comfortable you

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,010
are with summation, I remember
the first time l learned

67
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,170
calculus, I wasn't that
comfortable with summation, but

68
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,030
it's really, all the indefinite
integral, is is you can kind of

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,590
view it as a sum, right?

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,130
So now, you'll maybe understand
a little bit more why this

71
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,860
symbol looks kind
of like a sigma.

72
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,270
That's actually how I view it.

73
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,320
And please look it up so
you can see properly

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,250
drawn integrals.

75
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,830
But in this case, the
indefinite integral is just

76
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,700
saying, well, I'm going to take
the sum from t equals 0, right,

77
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,910
so from t equals 0, to let's
say in this example, t equals

78
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,560
10, right, because I said 10.

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,660
From t equals 0 to t equals 10.

80
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,150
and I'm going to take the sum
of each of the heights, the

81
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,810
height at any given point,
which is the velocity.

82
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,280
   

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,720
And then, what's the
formula for the velocity?

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:13,140
It's 32t and then I'm at
times the base at each

85
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,620
of these rectangles, dt.

86
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,440
And so this is the
definite integral.

87
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,620
The definite integral is
literally, and they never do

88
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,050
this in math texts, and that's
what always kind of confused

89
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,560
me, is that you can kind of
view it like a sum, like this.

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,140
   

91
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,090
It's kind of the sum of each of
these rectangles, but it's the

92
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,680
limit, as-- if these were
discrete rectangles, you could

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,110
just do a sum, and you could
make the rectangle bases

94
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,870
smaller and smaller, and have
more and more rectangles,

95
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,210
and just do a regular sum.

96
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,870
And actually, that's how, if
you ever write a computer

97
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,770
program to approximate an
integral, or approximate the

98
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,640
area under a curve, that's
the way a computer program

99
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,020
would actually do it.

100
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,480
But the actual indefinite
integral says, well, this is a

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,310
sum, but it's the limit as the
bases of these rectangles get

102
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,230
smaller and smaller and smaller
and smaller, and we have more

103
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,940
and more and more of
these rectangles.

104
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,310
So as these dt's approach 0,
the number of rectangles

105
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,880
actually approach infinity.

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,950
So I'm actually going to, I'll
do that more rigorously later,

107
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,780
but I think it's very important
to get this intuitive feel

108
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,680
of just what an integral is.

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,930
It isn't just this voodoo
that happens to be there.

110
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,160
But anyway, so going
back to the problem.

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,360
So the integral from-- this
is now a definite integral,

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,670
extending from t equals
0 to t equals 10.

113
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,020
This tells us 2 things.

114
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,300
This tells us the area of the
curve from t equals zero to t

115
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,360
equals 10, right, it tells us
this whole area, and it also

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,580
tells us how far the object
has gone after 10 seconds.

117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,320
Right?

118
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,450
So it's very interesting.

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,770
The indefinite integral
tells us 2 things.

120
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,160
It tells us area, and it also
tells us the antiderivative.

121
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Right?

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,130
We're already familiar with
it as an antiderivative.

123
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,220
So let me give you
another example.

124
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,760
Actually, maybe I'll stick
with this example, but

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,650
I'll clear it a bit.

126
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,310
Actually, maybe I should erase.

127
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,810
Erasing might be a good
option with this one,

128
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,190
since it's fairly messy.

129
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,830
I think you know all
this stuff now.

130
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,760
I just need space.

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,830
   

132
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,372
Maybe, OK, so we have that
indefinite integral.

133
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,040
And we could actually
figure it out, too.

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,470
I mean, well, after t
seconds, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

135
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,920
So and the way you evaluate an
indefinite integral, and let me

136
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,780
show you that first, is that
you figure out the integral.

137
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,740
So let me just say, let
me continue with the

138
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,060
problem, actually.

139
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,790
As you can tell, I don't plan
much for these presentations.

140
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,170
So the way you figure out the
indefinite integral, is you

141
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,300
say, and sometimes they won't
write t equals 0 to t equals t.

142
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:54,610
They'll just say from
0 to 10 of 32t dt.

143
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,370
Right?

144
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,770
And the way you evaluate
this, is you figure out the

145
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,780
antiderivative, and you really
don't have to do the plus c

146
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,330
here, so the antiderivative, we
know, is 16t squared, right?

147
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,440
It's one half t
squared times 32.

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,690
So that's 16t squared.

149
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,300
   

150
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,010
And we evaluate this at ten,
and we evaluate it at 0, and

151
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,680
then we subtract
the difference.

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,250
So we evaluate this at 10,
so 16 times 100, right?

153
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,060
That's evaluated at 10,
and then we subtract

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,155
it, evaluate at 0.

155
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,320
So 16 times 0 is 0.

156
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,960
So after 10 seconds, we
would have gone 1600 feet.

157
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:41,230
And also, the area under
this curve is 1600.

158
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,200
So let's use this to do
a couple more examples.

159
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,990
And actually, I want to show
you why we do this subtraction.

160
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,560
Actually, I'm going to
do that right now.

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,110
Let me clear it.

162
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:00,600
   

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,850
Oh, that's ugly.

164
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,520
   

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,100
I'll now do it more
general, actually.

166
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,700
   

167
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,600
Let me draw this twice,
once for the distance, and

168
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,480
once for its derivative.

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,860
   

170
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,580
So let's say that the distance,
yeah, well, let's just say it

171
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,670
looks something like this.

172
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,580
Let's say you start at some
distance, and then it

173
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,350
goes off like that.

174
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,410
Right?

175
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,190
So let's say we call
this distance b.

176
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,160
Well, let's just call this,
you know, I don't know, 5.

177
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,450
Right?

178
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,600
We start at 5 feet, and then
we moved forward from there.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,600
And this axis is of course
time, this axis, maybe I

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,590
shouldn't do 5, because
it looks so much like s.

181
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,280
That's 5, 5 feet.

182
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,420
And this is the s,
or distance, axis.

183
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,270
And actually, I just
looked at the clock.

184
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,310
I'm running out of time.

185
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,120
So let me continue this in
the next presentation.

186
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,400
