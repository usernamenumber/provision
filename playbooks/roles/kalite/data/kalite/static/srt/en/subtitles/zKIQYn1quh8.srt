1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,370
Let's do some SAT problems. Let's see,

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,630
we're starting test 5 now

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,540
and it's problem number 1.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,330
This is page 652.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,780
According to a certain recipe,20-- I'm getting deja-vu,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,200
this looks like a question I did in the last test,

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,670
but maybe this is different--

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,870
25 pounds of flour are needed to make 300 rolls.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,510
So 25 pounds per 300 hundred rolls.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,860
At this rate,

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:38,660
how many pounds of flour are needed to make 12 rolls?

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,710
Well, we can make a ratio here.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:48,300
So I need 25 to do 300 rolls,right?

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,830
But they're asking us well,

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,140
how much do I need if I only need to do 12 rolls?

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,450
So 12 is what fraction of 300?

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,390
Whatever that fraction is,

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,670
the fraction of rolls of pounds of flour I need to use

19
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,570
will be the same fraction.

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,100
Let's say that this is x is the pounds of flour I need to use

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,280
So x is to 25 as twelve is to 300.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
And I can tell you from inspection that

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,260
12 over 300 is the same thing as 1/25.

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,360
If you don't believe me,

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,000
divide 300 by 12 and I come up with that.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,220
Well, you know 25 goes into 100 4 times

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,170
and then 4 times 3 is 12.

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,020
If you don't believe me,you can confirm this.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,460
And they did it on purpose because this is the first problem,

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,690
which tends to be a quick one.

31
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,180
So x over 25 is equal to one over 25, so x equals 1.

32
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,990
So you need 1 pound of flour.

33
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,140
And you could have also set the ratio up like this:

34
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,710
you could have said 25 is to 300 as x is to 12.

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,720
This would have also worked.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,960
Here we would have put the rolls all on one fraction

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,570
and we could've put the pounds of flour

38
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,060
all on the other fraction.

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,730
Next problem.

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,490
Switching colors.

41
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,190
Problem number 2.

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,490
If xy is equal to 10,

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:25,660
what is the value of 2 times x divided by y times y squared?

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,650
Well the trick here is you've got to simplify this expression

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,990
before you attempt to do anything.

46
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,840
And simplifying, what's x divided by y times y squared?

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,530
Well this right here,

48
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,420
this is the same thing as xy squared divided by y, right?

49
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,940
We could put the 2 out here.

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,900
And see, we have a 2 on top and the y on the bottom is

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,320
the same thing as y to the first,so this is the same thing.

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,220
What's y squared divided by y?

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,940
Well it's just y, right?

54
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,150
So we get 2x and y squared divided by y is just y, right?

55
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,890
The squared cancels out with this entire term.

56
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,780
This just gets 1.

57
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,730
I divide the top and the bottom by 1.

58
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,810
So all I'm left with is 2xy,

59
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,550
and we know that xy is equal to 10, so 2 times 10 is 20.

60
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,250
That's choice e.

61
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,320
Next problem.

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,080
Problem 3.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,100
Let's see if I can fit it on this without having to--

64
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:29,610
x plus y is equal to 30.

65
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,560
I might be talking funny.

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,450
I just came from the dentist. And x is greater than 8.

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,390
Which of the following must be true?

68
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,530
Well, we know x is greater than 8,

69
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,610
and we also know that x is equal to 30 minus y, right?

70
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,130
I just subtracted y from both sides of that equation.

71
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,830
x is equal to 30 minus y.

72
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,370
Well we also know that x is greater than 8, so 30 minus y,

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,620
which is the same thing as x,

74
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,540
must also be greater than 8, right?

75
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,320
30 minus y is also going to be greater than 8.

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,380
And we could play with this a little bit.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,790
We could add y to both sides

78
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,360
and get 30 is greater than 8 plus y.

79
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,550
We could subtract 8 from both sides

80
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:23,720
and then you get 22 is greater than y, or y is less than 22.

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,870
And that's choice b.

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,760
Next problem.

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,660
Problem 4.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,030
I'm writing in toothpaste color

85
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,860
in honor of my recent visit to the dentist.

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,270
OK, what do they have here?

87
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,440
They have three points.

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,340
So point p, which is 3 comma 2.

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,540
Point q, which is 7 comma 2.

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,220
And point r, which is 7 comma 4.

91
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,440
The coordinates of points p, q, and r and the xy plane

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,370
are given above.

93
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,360
What is the perimeter of pqr?

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,510
Let's draw that real fast.

95
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,980
I think that'll make things make more sense,

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,620
especially if you missed it the first time around.

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,190
So p is 3 comma 2.

98
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,310
So 3 comma 2, approximately.

99
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,020
q is 7 comma 2, so this is 3.

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,660
So this is going to be a straight line.

101
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,940
And what's this length going to be?

102
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,410
Well, it's going to be 4 because it's going from 3 to 7

103
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,010
and we have no change in the y, they're both at 2.

104
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,700
Then we have r is 7 comma 4.

105
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,090
It's going to be roughly over here.

106
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,260
This is q, this is r.

107
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,350
And what's this distance?

108
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,520
Well we had no change it x,

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,840
so the distance is just going to be the change in y,

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,760
so this is just 2.

111
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,700
And now we have to-- and this is r--

112
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,530
and now the only thing we have to do to finish this problem

113
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,700
is figure out that distance.

114
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,640
And how do we figure out that distance?

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,120
Well this is a right triangle,

116
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,750
so we could use the Pythagorean theorem.

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,440
2 squared-- this is the hypotenuse, right?

118
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,540
The green side I drew, that's the longest side

119
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,910
and it's opposite the 90-degree angle,

120
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,950
so it's the hypotenuse.

121
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:30,080
So 2 squared plus 4 squared is equal to-- let's call this x--

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,650
is equal to x squared.

123
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,180
So this is 4 plus 16 is equal to x squared.

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,520
20 is equal to x squared.

125
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,920
So x is equal to the square root of 20.

126
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,630
So x is equal to-- let's try to simplify this,

127
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,160
that's the square root of 4 times 5, right?

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,950
And we know what the square root of 4 is,

129
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,730
so we can take that out.

130
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,600
So that's x is equal to 2 root 5.

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,080
I find that

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,850
this is actually where most people have a lot of trouble,

133
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,000
simplifying root 20 to 2 root 5.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,550
All we did is we factor 20 as a product of a perfect square

135
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,360
and another number that's not a perfect square.

136
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,990
And then we took the perfect square out.

137
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,040
We said the square root of 4 is 2, so we can take it out.

138
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,080
So x is 2 root 5.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,690
So what's the perimeter?

140
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,090
It's 4 plus 2 plus 2 root 5.

141
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,490
So 4 plus 2 is 6 plus 2 root 5.

142
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,030
Now let me see what the choices are.

143
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,350
Oh, I didn't even have to do 2 root 5.

144
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,370
They actually have choice c says

145
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
6 plus the square root of 20.

146
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,510
So I didn't even have to do this but that's good to know.

147
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,090
This, what I did here,is good to learn.

148
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,030
But they made it so we didn't have to do that.

149
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,300
So it never hurts to glance at your choices

150
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,620
before you move forward like I just did.

151
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,580
Invert colors. I'm getting tired of this color,

152
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,490
so I will switch.

153
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,950
Problem number 5.

154
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:11,520
They give us a sequence: 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, and so on.

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,830
The first five terms in a sequence are shown above.

156
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,940
Each term after the first is found

157
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,000
by adding 9 to the term immediately preceding it.

158
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,260
Which term in the sequence

159
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:33,390
is equal to 8 plus 26 minus 1 times 9?

160
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,180
Fascinating.

161
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,860
So each term is equal to 9 plus the previous term, right?

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,460
So the first term, let's say term one,

163
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,290
let's call this the term.

164
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,420
Term one is 8.

165
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,040
Term two, let's call this t for term.

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,940
Term two is 17.

167
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,310
And an equation we could have gotten that is we could've

168
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:12,010
gotten 8 plus 2 times-- oh sorry, 8 plus 9 times what?

169
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,630
The term minus 1, right?

170
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,100
Because that's just 8 plus 9 so if the term is 2,

171
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,990
2 minus 1 is 1.

172
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,370
So we multiply it times 9 and we add it to 8.

173
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,440
Similarly, the third term, which is 26.

174
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,070
That's essentially 8 plus 16, right?

175
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,860
So that's 8 plus-- I'm sorry, 8 plus 18.

176
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,970
So it's 8 plus 9 times-- once again,

177
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,540
t minus 1, or 3 minus 1.

178
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,640
Right here it's 2 minus 1, here it's 3 minus 1.

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,740
So in general, this is the t-th term.

180
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,850
This is the equation of the t-th term,

181
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,810
which looks oddly familiar

182
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,360
to what they give us in the beginning.

183
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,380
And if we do a little pattern matching,

184
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,080
we see that t is equal to 26.
