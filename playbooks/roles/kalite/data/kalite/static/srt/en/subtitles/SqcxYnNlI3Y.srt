1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,430
In the last video we learned a
little bit about what the

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,030
expected value of random
variable is, and we saw that it

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,660
was really just the population
mean-- the same thing.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,600
But with a random variable,
since the population is

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,880
infinite, you can't take
up all of the terms and

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,140
then average them out.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,620
What you have to do is say OK,
each of these terms occur with

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,280
some frequency or with some
probability, and you kind of

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,100
just take a probability
weighted sum.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,180
Which we saw in the last video
was the exact same thing as

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,420
adding everything together and
dividing by the number of

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,460
numbers, except that that
method worked with an infinite

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,850
number of an infinite
population what the

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,510
random variable is.

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,230
Because you can just keep on
performing the experiment that

17
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,980
generates the random variable.

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,400
And then, we actually
calculated the expected value

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,580
for the particular binomial
distributions that we studied,

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,040
especially the one with the
flipping of the coin.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,840
In this video we'll find a
general formula for the mean,

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,200
or actually, for the expected
value of a binomial

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,830
distribution.

24
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:05,750
So if we say that the random
variable, x, is equal to the

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,795
number of-- we could
call it successes.

26
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:12,550
   

27
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:30,430
The number of successes with
probability p after n trials.

28
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,770
So I'm being a little
bit generally here.

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,060
I mean I could have said the
number of successful heads,

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,940
which have a probability
of 0.5 after 10 flips.

31
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,420
That's the same thing is this,
I'm just being a little

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,990
bit more general here.

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,300
And now, we'll actually
figure out what the

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,500
expected value of this is.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,850
And we saw if you actually
figured out the probability

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,970
distribution for this random
variable you get that nice

37
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,070
binomial distribution that
looks a little bit

38
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,840
like a bell curve.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,360
And we'll study more
about bell curves later.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,580
And before I actually
show it to you I'll

41
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,980
give you the answer.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,470
Because the answer, to
some degree, is actually

43
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,850
pretty intuitive.

44
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,730
The expected value of this
random variable is n times

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,810
p, or sometimes people
will write p times n.

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,920
Let me make that a little
bit more tangible for you.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,600
So if I said that x is-- let me
do it in a different color.

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:31,510
Let's see, x is equal to the
number of baskets I make.

49
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,430
Where I'm talking about
basketball, not basket weaving.

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:43,350
Number of baskets I make after
10 shots where I have the

51
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,270
probability of me making any 1
shot is-- I don't know-- 40%.

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,010
We know that the expected
number of baskets I

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,550
make after 10 shots.

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,120
So we know that the expected
number of baskets I make after

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,770
10 shots, where each of my
shots is 40%-- all I have to do

56
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,410
is multiply the probability
times the number of

57
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,720
baskets I'm taking.

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,390
So I multiply probability times
the number of baskets or the

59
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,740
number of shots I'm taking,
which should be equal to 4.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,940
So I know I said-- and you
really shouldn't necessarily

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,310
strictly view expected value as
the number of shots you should

62
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,630
expect to make because
sometimes probability

63
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,770
distributions can
be kind of weird.

64
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,490
But in the binomial
distribution you can kind

65
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,290
of view it that way.

66
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,200
That this is the number of
shots you would expect to make.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,090
Or you can kind of view it
as the most likely outcome.

68
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,340
That if you have a 40% shot
percentage, and you takes 10

69
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,320
shots, the most likely outcome
is that you'll make 4 shots.

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,080
You still might make 6 shots or
3 shots, but this is going to

71
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,650
be the most likely outcome.

72
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,790
and in my head, the way I think
about, the way it makes

73
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,260
intuitive sense is that every
time you shoot you have a 40%

74
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,280
chance of making the shot.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
So you could say that you
always make 40% of a shot.

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,390
And if you take 10 shots you're
going to make 4 whole shots.

77
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,420
So that's one way to think
about it and why this might

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,190
make a little intuitive sense.

79
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,170
But now, let's prove it to
ourselves that this is really

80
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,110
true for any a random variable
that's described by a

81
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,170
binomial distribution.

82
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,270
So in a binomial distribution
what is the probability-- so if

83
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,110
I say, what is the probability
that X is equal to k?

84
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,770
And I know it just gets a
little complicated sometimes.

85
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,010
But I'm just saying, what's
the probability say in

86
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,440
this basketball analogy.

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
Would be you know, what's the
probability that I make--

88
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,850
k could be 3 shots or
something like that.

89
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,880
So that's what we're
talking about.

90
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,350
And that we learned was, if
we're taking n shots we're

91
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,720
going to choose k of them.

92
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,740
And we did that several times
in the last couple of videos.

93
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,940
And then we multiply that times
the probability of any one of

94
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,610
those particular occurrences.

95
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,100
So if I'm making k shots, it'll
be the probability of me making

96
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,610
any one shot, Which is
p to the kth power.

97
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,950
p times itself k times.

98
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,360
That's the probability
of me making k shots.

99
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,800
And then the rest of the
shots I have to miss.

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,360
So the probability of
a miss is 1 minus p.

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,180
And then how many shots?

102
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,450
If I've made k shots, the rest
of the shots I have to miss.

103
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,780
So I'm going to miss
n minus k shots.

104
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,240
So in any binomial distribution
this is a probability

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
that you get k successes.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,380
Now we know that the expected
value, the way you calculate an

107
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,020
expected value of a random
variable is you just take the

108
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,710
probability weighted sum.

109
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,160
I don't want to confuse you
too much and if you main take

110
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,960
away from this video is just
this, that's good enough.

111
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,990
You should feel good.

112
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,890
Now it'll get a little
technical, but it'll hopefully

113
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,630
make you a little bit more
comfortable with sigma and

114
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,680
sum notation as well.

115
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,570
It'll make you a little
bit more comfortable with

116
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,250
binomial coefficients
and things like that.

117
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,140
But just going back, the
expected value is a a

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,130
probability weighted
sum of each of these.

119
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,700
So what you want to do is you
want to take the probability

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,300
that X is equal to k, times
k, and then add that up for

121
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,580
each of the possible k's.

122
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,860
So how would I write that?

123
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,600
So the expected value of X, the
expected value of our random

124
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,560
variable that's being described
as binomial distribution--

125
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,340
it's equal to the sum.

126
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,910
   

127
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,750
And we're going to sum all of
the values that k can take on.

128
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,480
So k can start at 0-- in the
basketball version, I make no

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,160
shots-- all the way to n,
which means I make n shots.

130
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,350
And for each of them you want
to multiply k, so the outcome,

131
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,390
so I made k shots, times the
probability that

132
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,030
I make k shots.

133
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,700
Well, what was the probability
that I make k shots?

134
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,460
That was this right here.

135
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,730
So it'd be k times n choose
k times p to the k times 1

136
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,730
minus p to the n minus k.

137
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,370
And now we're just going
to do some algebra, some

138
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,750
sigma algebra I guess
you could call it.

139
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,380
So the first simplification
we can make is we're summing

140
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,710
from k equals 0 to n.

141
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,240
So the first term here is going
to have a k equals 0 here.

142
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,230
This is going to be 0
in the first term.

143
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,350
So this first term is 0, then
this whole thing is going to be

144
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,170
0, and the k equals 0 term
won't contribute to the sum

145
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,910
because this whole
thing will be 0.

146
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,800
Let me that write because I
think it's-- so this sum could

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,450
be written as 0 times n choose
0 times p to the 0 times 1

148
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,580
minus p to the n minus 0.

149
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,600
Plus 1 times n choose 1 times
p to the 1 times 1 minus

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,710
p to the n minus 1.

151
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,150
And then you keep adding,
all the way until you

152
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,810
get to k is equal to n.

153
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,430
So it'd be n times n choose
n times p to the n, times

154
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,250
1 minus p, n minus n.

155
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,650
This is just another way of
writing this sum up here.

156
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,690
And what I just said is the
first term, which is this term,

157
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,920
is going to be equal to 0
because k is equal to 0.

158
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,090
0 times any thing is 0.

159
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,540
So we can ignore that term and
we can rewrite this sum as

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,230
essentially this
sum right here.

161
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,020
   

162
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,660
And so if we were to do that
we're essentially just

163
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,820
rewrite this thing up here.

164
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,730
So the expected value
of our random variable

165
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,890
is equal to the sum.

166
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,540
And we don't have to go
from k equal 0, we could

167
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,450
start at k equal 1 now.

168
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,130
From k equals 1 to n of the
same thing. k times n choose

169
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:28,230
k times p to the k, times
1 minus p, n minus k.

170
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,490
Let's see what we
can do from here.

171
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,600
All we did so far is we got rid
of that first term because

172
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,410
that's kind of the trick we'll
use to simplify this eventually

173
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,150
to the result that
we want to have.

174
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,420
So let's write out the binomial
coefficient and see if we

175
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,780
can do something there.

176
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Oh, look at this.

177
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,330
My iPod wants to sync.

178
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,120
Let me get rid of that.

179
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,030
All right, so then,
where was I?

180
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,250
OK, so then this is equal to--
I'm just going to write out

181
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,520
the binomial coefficient.

182
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,960
k equals 1 to n.

183
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:03,750
k times-- this right here is
n factorial over k factorial

184
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,610
over n minus k factorial.

185
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,970
Times p to the k times 1
minus p to the n minus k.

186
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,370
And here we can make a little
bit of a simplification

187
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,100
because what's k
divided by k factorial?

188
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,870
Maybe I could rewrite it a
different way. k factorial is k

189
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,530
times k minus 1 times k minus
2, and so forth, all the

190
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,010
way until you get to 1.

191
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,180
This is k factorial.

192
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,270
So k factorial could be written
as k times k minus 1 factorial.

193
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,300
It's k times, and then the
number 1 smaller then k times

194
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,330
all the numbers below it.

195
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,000
So let me rewrite.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,640
So this could be rewritten as
k times k minus 1 factorial.

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
And the whole reason why I
did that is so I can cancel

198
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,100
this k out with that k.

199
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,540
So if I cancel that out I
think this warrants rewriting

200
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,490
the whole thing again.

201
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,900
So now, I guess you could argue
simplified it to, it equals the

202
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:15,250
sum from k is equal to 1 to n
of n factorial over k

203
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,920
minus 1 factorial.

204
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,400
Times n minus k factorial times
p to the k times 1 minus

205
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,560
p to the n minus k.

206
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,350
And let's do another
simplification.

207
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,270
Now, what I want to do and
we kind of know where

208
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,140
we're heading, right?

209
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,540
This should simplify
to n times p.

210
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,320
So let's see if we can factor
out an n times p and then let's

211
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,930
see if we can turn everything
else into a 1, and then

212
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,230
we would be done.

213
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,640
So we could rewrite n factorial
using the same trick up here.

214
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,210
n factorial can be rewritten as
n times n minus 1 factorial

215
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,710
by the same logic.

216
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:58,450
And then p to they k could
be rewritten as p times

217
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,610
p to the k minus 1.

218
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,680
And then we can factor out this
n and this p and we'll get it's

219
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,190
equal to np times the sum from
k is equal to 1 to

220
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,470
n of-- let's see.

221
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,360
We factored that n and p out.

222
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,910
n minus 1 factorial over k
minus one factorial times

223
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,210
n minus k factorial.

224
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,140
Times p to the k minus 1.

225
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,160
That's not in the denominator.

226
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:40,150
This is just a regular-- times
1 minus p to the n minus k.

227
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,900
And we're close.

228
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,500
Remember, we want the result
that the expected value of our

229
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,930
variable, and that's what
we were doing before.

230
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,550
That this should
be equal to this.

231
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,090
So we'll be done if we can
just show that this whole

232
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,295
thing here equals 1.

233
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:57,970
And to do that I'll make a
simplifying substitution.

234
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,380
Let me make the substitution--
I don't know-- let's say that

235
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,990
a is equal to k minus 1.

236
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,710
And that b is equal
to n minus 1.

237
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,270
And then what would
n minus k equal to?

238
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,580
Let's see.

239
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,920
If a is equal to k minus 1
then a plus 1 is equal to k.

240
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,890
And then here, b plus 1 is
equal to n, so then n minus

241
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:28,320
k would be equal to this,
a plus 1 minus this.

242
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,850
Minus b minus 1, these
would cancel out.

243
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,720
Which would equal a minus b.

244
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,340
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

245
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:44,020
So this whole sum will then
turn into np times the sum

246
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,510
from-- OK, when k is equal to
1, that's the same thing--

247
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,760
when k is equal to 1,
what is a equal to?

248
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,350
a is equal to 0.

249
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:02,230
From a equal to 0 to-- now
when k is equal to n,

250
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,890
what will a be equal to?

251
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,350
If this is equal to n,
if k is n, then a is

252
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,830
equal to n minus 1.

253
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,110
So we have a equal to a
to a equals n minus 1.

254
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,760
But n minus 1 is the
same thing as b.

255
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,870
So we could rewrite
the sum there.

256
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,120
That's always a
little confusing.

257
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,140
You might want to pause and
think about that a little bit.

258
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,210
But I realize I'm already
over time, so I'll just

259
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,970
keep moving forward.

260
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,280
And then we had b is
equal to n minus 1.

261
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,280
So that'll be b factorial
over k minus 1 , we made

262
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,910
the definition that
that's equal to a.

263
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,060
So that's a factorial.

264
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:47,030
And then over here, n
minus k should be a--

265
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,560
oh, you know what?

266
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,750
I reversed this. n minus
ok should be b minus a.

267
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,280
n minus k-- right.

268
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,490
n is b plus 1, so it's b
plus 1 minus a plus 1.

269
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,550
Minus a, minus 1.

270
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,760
So the 1's cancel out
and you get b minus a.

271
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,730
So the n minus k will become
b minus a factorial.

272
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,580
And then p to the k minus 1--
k minus 1 is p to the a.

273
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,230
And then times 1 minus
p to the n minus k.

274
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,815
We already showed that
n minus k is the same

275
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:23,510
things as b minus a.

276
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,080
And then here, and we're
pretty much done now-- this

277
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,760
right here, what is this?

278
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,500
This is the probability
of-- well, let me rewrite

279
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,320
it a simpler way.

280
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,510
This is equal to np times the
sum from a is equal to 0 to b.

281
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,080
What is this?

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,816
This is b choose a.

283
00:14:44,816 --> 00:14:48,120
I have b things and I want to
choose a things from them, how

284
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,580
many different ways can I--
times p to the a times 1

285
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,220
minus p to the b minus a.

286
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,380
What is this thing here?

287
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,520
This is you're taking every
term of the binomial

288
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,110
distribution.

289
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,280
So you're saying, what
is the probability

290
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,840
when a is equal to 0?

291
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,990
This is the probability for
each of the a's, right?

292
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,750
And you're summing up over all
of the a's you can achieve.

293
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,360
So if I were to draw a quick
dirty distribution like this,

294
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,700
if a is equal to 0 you have
a certain probability.

295
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,280
Then a certain probability for
a equals 1. and then another

296
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,490
probability, and
it goes higher.

297
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,820
Then it's like a bell curve,
something like that.

298
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,550
This term right here
is each of these.

299
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,610
Each of these boxes you
could say represents

300
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,740
one of these terms.

301
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,460
When a equals 0 it's this term.

302
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,240
When a equals 1 it's this term.

303
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,580
When a equals 2 it's this
term, all the way to b terms.

304
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,320
But we're summing them
up, so we're summing all

305
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,860
of the probabilities.

306
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,670
We're summing over all
of the values that our

307
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,240
random variable can take.

308
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
So if we solved all the
probabilities that a random

309
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,040
variable can take, or we're
summing over all of the values,

310
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,170
this is going to sum up to 1.

311
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,420
This is like saying that this
is the probability of heads

312
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,810
plus the probability of tails.

313
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,630
Or you could say in the
flipping of a coin analogy,

314
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,210
this is the probability that I
have one heads plus the

315
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,210
probability I have 2 heads,
plus the probability I have 3

316
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,465
heads, plus the probability I
have 4 heads, all the way to

317
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,660
the probability I have b heads.

318
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,690
So it's pretty much every
circumstance that can occur.

319
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,640
So this is the sum over
the entire probability

320
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,840
distribution, and so that
is going to be equal to 1.

321
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,680
And so, we're left with
the expected value of our

322
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,500
random variable, X, is
equal to n times p.

323
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,390
Where n is the number of trials
and p is the probability

324
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,830
of success on each trial.

325
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,745
And this is true only for
binomial distributions.

326
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:45,700
It isn't true for any
random variable, X.

327
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,540
Only true for random variable,
X, whose probability

328
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,230
distribution is the
binomial distribution.

329
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,770
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

330
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,910
I'll see you in the next video.

331
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,000
