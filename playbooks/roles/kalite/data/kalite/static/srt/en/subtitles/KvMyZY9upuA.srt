1
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:04,297
f of x is equal to 2 x times the principal square root of five minus 4

2
00:00:04,297 --> 00:00:11,287
g of x is equal to x squared plus two x times the principle square root of 5 - 1

3
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:23,198
find g minus f of x

4
00:00:23,198 --> 00:01:38,060
and once again g minus f of x is really just referring to a function thats made by substracting the function

5
00:01:38,060 --> 00:02:12,584
definition for f from the function definition of g

6
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:55,117
so this is going to be the same thing as g of x MINUS f of x

7
00:02:55,117 --> 00:03:02,356
and then we can use the function definitions to substitute back here to figure out what g - f actually is

8
00:03:02,356 --> 99:59:59,999
x actually is
