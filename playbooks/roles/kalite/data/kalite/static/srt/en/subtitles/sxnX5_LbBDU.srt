1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,099
On the first day of Christmas

2
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,050
my true love gave to me

3
00:00:13,053 --> 00:00:21,071
the multiplicative identity.

4
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:24,058
I always hated the song

5
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:26,026
"The Twelve Days of Christmas"

6
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,022
when I was younger.

7
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,036
Not that the tune or the words are any

8
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:29,094
worse than any other Christmas song

9
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,041
but it's just so long and repetitive.

10
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,084
Singing it sucks too

11
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:34,013
because like math class it seems

12
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,025
no matter how hard you try to pay attention

13
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:37,096
you lose focus out of the sheer tedium of it all

14
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,081
and forget where you are, unless you keep

15
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:43,013
vigorous records by drawing complicated graphs.

16
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,093
On the second day of Christmas

17
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:50,084
my true love gave to me the only even prime

18
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:58,019
and the absolute value of e to the i Pi.

19
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,042
See it doesn't have to be repetitive

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,060
but the "Twelve Days of Christmas"

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,026
is more fun to think about than

22
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,018
to actually sing or listen to.

23
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,082
I do like these kinds of visualizations

24
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:08,019
and you can think of other ways to visualize

25
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,077
the process of singing the "Twelve Days"

26
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:11,044
which might come in useful next time you are

27
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:13,014
at a family Christmas party and someone

28
00:01:13,014 --> 00:01:16,001
insists on singing through the whole thing.

29
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,094
On the third day of Christmas, my true love

30
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:23,085
gave to me, the number of spatial dimensions

31
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:25,037
at least macroscopically -

32
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:26,091
don't yell at me strict theorists -

33
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:29,074
the number of points that define a line

34
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:37,019
and the limit of sine x, over x, as x goes to zero.

35
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,056
Unlike normal reasonable songs adding twelve

36
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,005
more verses wouldn't just make it twice as long

37
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,046
because the stupid thing just grows and grows

38
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:45,078
even ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall

39
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:47,073
has a promise of getting to zero unless

40
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:50,080
you believe in anti beer. But "Twelve Days" is just

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,087
disheartening, because the closer you think

42
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:54,092
you're getting to the end the longer the verses get

43
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,045
dragging it out to the bitter end.

44
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,099
On the fourth day of Christmas

45
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,018
my true love gave to me

46
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:04,070
the smallest possible number of sides on a polyhedron

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,033
the number of points that define a plane

48
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,093
the divisor of even numbers and

49
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:15,020
any other number to the power of zero.

50
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,064
If i had a time machine and was not bitterly

51
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,037
anti-time travel, and yes I've actually

52
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:22,004
protested with this sign. One of the things

53
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:24,030
on my list would be to go back to year zero -

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,056
pick your era and be like "hey"" three kings

55
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,026
of Orient hurry it up will ya??

56
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,015
Also what's myrrh because it sounds like the noise

57
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,031
a camel makes... Really though five days

58
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:33,073
of Christmas would be more reasonable.

59
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:35,062
Even eight, I could live with.

60
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:39,033
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love

61
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,070
gave to me...

62
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:50,034
five golden ratio producing pentagons,

63
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:53,028
the number of sides on a square,

64
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,050
the number of sides on that rigid,

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,044
funtional and beautiful creature

66
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,024
called the triangle and

67
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,079
I guess a two....

68
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:10,019
and the number of sides on a MÃ¶bius strip.

69
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,057
Graphing the numbers like this may seem trivial

70
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:15,015
but I think it's nice to be reminded these

71
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:17,019
numbers aren't just squiggles on a page

72
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:18,082
symbols to be manipulated, but actually

73
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:21,092
represent something and I think it's nice that

74
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:23,071
it results in such a lovely triangle.

75
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:26,085
You know how I feel about triangles.

76
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:29,024
On the sixth day of Christmas

77
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:31,093
my true love gave to me...

78
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,002
my name in Roman numerals,

79
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:38,050
the number of feet in iambic pentameter.

80
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,028
My name in Roman numerals backwards,

81
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,094
the first Mersenne in a prime,

82
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:46,043
the number of syllables in a foot of iambic pentameter

83
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:51,041
and sine(x) squared plus cosine(x) squared.

84
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:54,000
Right, so if you want to know how many times

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,029
you're gonna have to sing a line about

86
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,096
whatever stuff your true love got you -

87
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,041
it's like counting up all the things

88
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,016
in one of these triangles that has

89
00:04:00,016 --> 00:04:02,027
however many layers - in this case twelve

90
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,049
the answer will be what's called a

91
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,090
triangular number for obvious reasons.

92
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,050
You can also shift the things around

93
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,008
to get an equilateral triangle

94
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,059
which is how triangular numbers

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,065
are usually explained.

96
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,058
So, the first triangular number is one.

97
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:15,059
The second is three. The third is six.

98
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:17,083
The fourth is ten.

99
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:21,021
On the seventh day of Christmas

100
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:25,015
my true love gave to me the most common

101
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,051
lucky number, the first perfect number,

102
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,078
the only prime ending in five...

103
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,047
the number of colors sufficient

104
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,017
for coloring in a map

105
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,068
the only prime triangular number

106
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:45,054
the highest number that is its own factorial

107
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:48,034
and a half, plus a fourth, plus an eighth,

108
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:52,072
plus a sixteenth and so on...

109
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,027
....almost.

110
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,074
Here's a famous story that I've heard told

111
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:57,082
a few different ways and the actual facts are fuzzy,

112
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,096
but basically here is the gist of it.

113
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:02,026
Carl Gauss was bored in his math class.

114
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,067
I can imagine why because not only was

115
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,088
Gauss a pretty smart guy,

116
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,014
but math classes sucked

117
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,021
three hundred years ago

118
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:09,034
just much as the suck today and

119
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:10,054
Gauss would get himself in trouble

120
00:05:10,054 --> 00:05:11,059
when he was bored.

121
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,080
Maybe he also like to escape via the window.

122
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,006
So, the teacher got fed up and was like

123
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:16,087
"Gauss" I mean he probably

124
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,084
called him "Carl"...but that's not the point.

125
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,034
"Gauss if you're so freaking bored with my class

126
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:23,001
how 'bout you go sit in the corner and add up

127
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,056
all the numbers between one and a hundred.

128
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,065
That ought to keep you busy for awhile."

129
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,000
So, Gauss goes to the corner, but he's just

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,065
sitting there and his teacher gets all mad and

131
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:32,066
is like "Hey Gauss, I guess that means

132
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,082
you've already added up all those numbers right?"

133
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,084
And Gauss is like "Sure, it's five thousand and fifty."

134
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:41,001
On the eighth day of Christmas, my true

135
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:44,003
love gave to me, the only perfect cubed

136
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:45,050
positive Fibonacci number besides one,

137
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,097
the number of frieze patterns,

138
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,006
the number of sides on a cube,

139
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:52,025
the number of platonic solids!

140
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,046
The first composite number,

141
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,073
the number of regular polytopes

142
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:57,063
in all dimensions greater than four

143
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:59,057
the Euler characteristic

144
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:02,030
of polyhedral homeomorphic to a sphere

145
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,063
and the number where the indivisive

146
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:09,042
phase of a logarithm is undefined....

147
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,072
His teacher of course didn't believe him.

148
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,073
I think the teacher spent the next 10 minutes

149
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,053
adding up the numbers by hand in an effort to

150
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,007
catch Gauss in a lie and when he saw that Gauss

151
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:19,029
was right, he probably gave him detention anyway.

152
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:21,004
Or, more likely whacked him with a ruler,

153
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:22,065
a few times for having the gall

154
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:24,067
to be smarter than him, or it could be

155
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,073
that the story is mostly made up.

156
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:27,041
I don't know, nevertheless

157
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,058
here's how he did it.

158
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,053
Instead of adding up the numbers

159
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,060
individually like his teacher did,

160
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,064
which would have been super boring,

161
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:34,054
he realized this fact.

162
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:37,049
The numbers one through a hundred, come in pairs

163
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:39,014
that add up to a hundred and one.

164
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:41,044
One plus a hundred, two plus ninety-nine,

165
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:43,039
three plus ninety-eight, four plus ninety seven,

166
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,093
and so on. There's fifty such pairs of numbers.

167
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:48,097
And, fifty times a hundred and one

168
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:49,062
is real easy to do in your head

169
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,027
'cause it's fifty times a hundred plus fifty.

170
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:53,012
Or, five thousand and fifty.

171
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,077
On the ninth day of Christmas, my true love

172
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:59,038
gave to me... an upside down six,

173
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,091
infinity sideways, flipped over "L",

174
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:08,027
an upside down 9, a funny looking "S",

175
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:12,088
a sail for a boat, backwards "E", half a heart on a

176
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:19,016
plate and a simple boring short and straight line...

177
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:22,034
So, yeah if you want to add up all the numbers

178
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,013
between one and anything, this trick works.

179
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:25,032
For example all the numbers between

180
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:27,099
one and twelve. One plus twelve is thirteen.

181
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:30,073
Two plus eleven is thirteen. All the way in

182
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:33,093
to six plus seven. That's six times thirteen,

183
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:34,055
which I do in my head as

184
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:37,009
sixty plus eighteen equals seventy-eight.

185
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:39,089
So, seventy-eight is the twelfth triangular number.

186
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,055
While five thousand and fifty is the

187
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,010
one hundredth triangular number.

188
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,019
At least it's not "One Hundred Days of Christmas".

189
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,072
I'll stick with bottles of beer.

190
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,050
On the tenth day of Christmas,

191
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,074
my true love gave to me...

192
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,048
The base of our Arabic numeral system!

193
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:02,023
The base of the nonary numeral system.

194
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,090
The base used in octal,

195
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,090
and the base of septenary,

196
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,019
and the base of senary

197
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:16,000
and a number five...

198
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:21,080
quaternary's base, tenary's base also

199
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,025
and binary too...

200
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:37,058
and the base of unary....

201
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,068
Here's my favorite way of visualizing

202
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,080
the triangular numbers.

203
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,070
Say you've got them in this configuration

204
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,086
where they make a nice right equilateral triangle.

205
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:47,021
Or, half a square. Finding the area of a square

206
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:49,073
is easy because you just square the length of it.

207
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:51,055
In this case, twelve times twelve.

208
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,094
And the triangle is half of that. Only, not really

209
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,020
because half the square means you only get

210
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,046
half of this diagonal. So, you've got to

211
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,068
add back in the other half.

212
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:00,080
But, that's easy because there's twelve things

213
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,072
in the diagonal, and twelve over 2 is six.

214
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,078
So, to get the nth triangular number,

215
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:07,059
just take n squared, over 2, plus n, over 2.

216
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:10,005
Or, n squared, plus n, over 2.

217
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,090
On the elventh day of Christmas

218
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,018
my true love gave to me...

219
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:16,068
the number my amp goes up to,

220
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,015
the number of fingers on my hand,

221
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,004
the German word for no,

222
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:21,010
what I did after I eat,

223
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,050
the number of heads on a hydra,

224
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,070
at least until you start cutting them off...

225
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,012
The number of strings on a guitar.

226
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:32,054
The number I like to do high....

227
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,088
The amount of horsemen of the Apocolypse.

228
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,096
The number of notes in a triad,

229
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:42,002
the number of pears, in a pair of pears...

230
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:45,073
and the number of Partridges

231
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:51,087
in a pear tree...

232
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:02,029
On the twelfth day of Christmas,

233
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,094
my true love gave to me..

234
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:09,007
Actually enough is enough...

235
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:12,047
Merry Christmath!

236
00:10:12,047 --> 99:59:59,999
Epsilon greater-than, VI HART
