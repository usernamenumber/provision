1
00:00:01,316 --> 00:00:04,899
Let's say that this is you. You're enjoying a nice sunny day

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:09,768
and you decided to take a nice long deep breath of air.

3
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:15,910
And of course when I say air the part that you 
probably care the most about is just the oxygen,

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,134
part of that air, that's the part that 
we as humans need to survive.

5
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:24,618
So you take a deep breath. 
Let's say you take it through your mouth,

6
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:26,953
you take a deep breath through your mouth.

7
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:30,095
And then lets say you take one more deep breath, 
a second deep breath,

8
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:31,904
and then you take that one through your nose.

9
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:36,707
And you might think, "Well, these are two totally 
different ways of getting in air."

10
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:40,183
That's certainly how it looks when 
you look at the mouth and nose.

11
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:42,177
They don't look like they have much in common.

12
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:45,428
But the truth is that actually if you follow the air,

13
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:50,011
it almost follows an identical path.

14
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:56,030
The air is gonna go into the back of the throat 
really regardless of how you took it in.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,598
So here we have air coming in from the nose,

16
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:03,916
in here yet air coming in from the mouth 
and they meet up in the back of throat.

17
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:10,402
And then they go down down down,
they go towards this thing that we call the Adam's apple.

18
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:14,542
I'm gonna bring it up a little bit, you can see it more easily.

19
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:19,030
But basically you bring up this, you see 
this Adam's apple right there.

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,705
And actually you can go ahead and 
take a feel of you own Adam's apple.

21
00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:27,146
It's a pretty cool structure in the middle of your throat

22
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:30,565
and everybody has it, that's the first thing I want to tell you,

23
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:34,416
that everybody has it, not just men, women have it too.

24
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:41,847
And the reason it's called an Adam's apple 
is because "Adam" is generally a boy's name.

25
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:49,432
And so it's to remind us that usually men or boys 
have larger Adam's apples than girls.

26
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:54,139
And if you're trying to find it, 
I also want to point that it's a notch here.

27
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:57,129
And you if you can feel the notch with your fingers,

28
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:00,467
in that case you have a nice clue as to where it is located.

29
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:06,526
This is Adam's apple and what it does is, 
it helps you control your voice.

30
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,893
And actually there's another name for Adam's apple.

31
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:13,693
Another name for it, sometimes 
people call it the voice box. The voice box.

32
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:21,553
And of course air is passing through the voice box 
in this kind of the entry way into the trachea.

33
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:28,471
And so it actually allows me to make my voice 
very high or make my voice very low,

34
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:34,096
depending on how you change 
the muscles around in that Adam's apple.

35
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:39,254
So that's actually kind of a first cool thing I want to point out to you, that you can actually control your voice.

36
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm sure you knew this already but what you're using 
is the Adam's apple, your voice box.

37
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,236
Now air keeps going, air is just gonna 
keeps making its journey down and

38
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:54,204
specifically of course the part of air I said, 
you know, we care about is the oxygen.

39
00:02:54,204 --> 00:02:58,063
It's gonna keep making its journey 
down into the lung areas,

40
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:05,283
now the lung areas, it's gone down the trachea and it goes into the two lungs, the right and left lungs.

41
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:11,365
This is the left lung, I'm gonna put L for left 
and this is the right lung, I'll put R for right.

42
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,889
And immediately you'll think, 
"Wait a second, aren't they switched?"

43
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,487
Now I want you to remember that this is from the perspective of the person who owns the lungs.

44
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:23,132
So that's why I put it in left where I put it, 
in right where I put it.

45
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:26,841
Now we should probably go ahead and 
start labelling some of these.

46
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:30,476
You can see that the lungs actually 
don't look identical, right?

47
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,712
They look slightly different, for example, 
this one has three lobes.

48
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:40,827
The right side has three lobes called 
the upper lobe, middle lobe and lower lobe.

49
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:45,279
And the left one only has two lobes, 
that's the first kind of a big difference.

50
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:53,809
And the other difference is that you actually have 
this thing in the middle that we call a cardiac notch.

51
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:57,166
This thing right here, this is called the cardiac notch.

52
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:03,163
And the reason we call it that is that 
it's a little spot that gets formed

53
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:07,714
because the heart is literally kind of peeking out here.

54
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,874
And as a result it's kind of makes a notch 
in the lung where it develops.

55
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:15,632
So the heart takes a little space here, this is the heart.

56
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:22,201
And as a result, it takes or makes that notch. 
So this is our heart space there.

57
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:27,144
So on the other side you've got of course 
your two lobes, your upper and lower lobes.

58
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:31,934
And these are exclusive, you see a lung 
that's kind of sitting by itself.

59
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:36,008
And you want to figure out whether 
it's the left lung or the right lung,

60
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:40,767
you can look for the lobes, the number of lobes, 
or you can look for that cardiac notch.

61
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:45,719
Now around here, around these lungs, you've got ribs.

62
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:52,120
You've got ribs here and between the ribs 
you've got rib muscles and of course on both sides.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,351
And below the lungs and below the heart, 
you've got a muscle, a big muscle.

64
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:05,798
Actually it's gonna come through here, 
I'm just gonna kind of go through the word heart,

65
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:08,399
and it basically becomes the floor.

66
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,405
So the heart and the two lungs sit on this floor 
that made up of this muscle

67
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:21,763
and this muscle is the diaphragm muscle. 
So this diaphragm muscle makes up the floor;

68
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:26,822
the ribs make up the walls. So what do we have?

69
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:32,696
We have basically a room, we have a giant room 
with walls and the floor.

70
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:36,331
And this entire room we actually call the thorax.

71
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:40,453
So within this room then you have 
your two lungs and your heart.

72
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:46,269
So, so far so good, but I haven't done a very nice job 
of actually showing you where the air goes.

73
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:51,164
I just kind of pointed that it goes to the two lungs, 
we don't have to get to see where it goes after that.

74
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,851
So let me actually, I'm gonna erase a lot of these.

75
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:59,763
I’m gonna reveal to you what it would look like. 
If you could slip on some X-ray glasses

76
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:03,185
and look into your two lungs, 
this is kind of what it would look like.

77
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:11,253
You've got all these interesting architecture and 
the easiest way to kind of think about this,

78
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:14,631
probably the simplest way to think about this, 
is to imagine a tree,

79
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:19,420
to imagine a tree, and that tree 
has been flipped upside down,

80
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,976
so you've got all these branches of that tree 
and they are branching and branching.

81
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:31,421
And if you flip this tree upside down, you start seeing that it looks a lot like what we have in our lungs.

82
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:37,654
Our lungs basically look like a flipped up or 
a flipped upside down tree and we even call that,

83
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:42,025
we even call this entire structure, 
we call it a bronchial tree.

84
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:47,336
So when you look at the lungs and 
they look kind of messier and complicated.

85
00:06:47,336 --> 00:06:52,145
Just think of them as an upside down bronchial tree 
and all of a sudden

86
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:57,809
it'll look much simpler with basically 
in the middle you've got this nice trunk,

87
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:01,518
this is our trunk, and then it's kind of 
branching from there.

88
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:06,057
So air goes down this main trunk, this trachea, 
and they kind of start splitting up.

89
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:12,983
And each of this kind of colored regions, the green region and the purple region serve a different lobe.

90
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:18,844
So this green region serves the lower lobe down here, 
the purple serves the upper lobe.

91
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:23,446
And on this side, you've got an upper, 
a middle and a lower lobe.

92
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,851
Now I know it looks a little bit strange because

93
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:30,268
you’ve got some green branches in what should be 
the middle lobe like right here;

94
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:34,173
you've got some orange branches in what 
looks like the upper lobe like right there.

95
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:39,251
But what you have to remember, this is kind of tricky, 
just try to play it in you head,

96
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:45,467
what you have to remember is that, what you have 
is basically a three dimensional lung.

97
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,718
So you have to imagine that we are literally 
looking at the front side,

98
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,008
but of course that middle lobe does go back.

99
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:57,677
And if you went back then you'd make perfect sense
why the orange branches are where they are at.

100
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:01,761
Now let me continue the air journey because 
I wanna make sure we finish it off.

101
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,740
So let's say we take a little branch like that, we expand it.

102
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,585
We keep zooming into it, zooming into it, zooming into it,

103
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:12,422
until it's microscopic, you cant see it 
with your eyes any more;

104
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:16,191
but you could see it under a microscope. 
It would look like this.

105
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:21,649
It would basically in a microscope, 
it would look like a bunch of little sacs like these.

106
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:27,214
And these sacs, we call these alveoli. Alveoli.

107
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:30,702
And the air, it actually kind of runs into the alveoli.

108
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:34,078
It has a dead end and then it comes back around.

109
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,418
And then you breathe it out. So that's how breathing works.

110
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:42,251
The air goes all the way from the mouth down 
to the alveoli, takes a U-turn and it goes back out.

111
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:49,394
But before it does that, before it leaves-
Very close to the alveoli is blood.

112
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:55,330
Let's say blood is coming this way and going that way, 
and what will happen is that,

113
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,507
actually out of the or into the blood, let's do that first.

114
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:05,256
We've got oxygen, oxygen will actually go into the blood, and out of the blood will be waste.

115
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:09,206
So you'll have some carbon dioxide waste 
that your cells have been making.

116
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:14,897
And that waste actually then 
gets thrown back into the alveoli.

117
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:18,569
So now you can see how oxygen 
gets from the outside world,

118
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:21,223
gets breathed into the lungs when you inhale,

119
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:25,203
gets down into the alveoli, exchanges with the blood;

120
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:28,402
and then you exhale and let all that carbon dioxide out.
