1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,680
Let's say I've got some
subspace of Rn.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:11,790
Let's say V is a
subspace of Rn.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,350
And let's say the set B-- I'll
do it in blue-- let's say the

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,880
set B is a basis for V,
so it's got a bunch

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,930
of vectors in it.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,480
And let's say it's got v1,
v2, all the way to vk.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,660
So you can see we have
k vectors, so v is a

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,790
k-dimensional subspace.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,960
So that means that if I have
some vector a-- let's say I

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,910
have some vector a that is a
member of my subspace-- that

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,640
means that I can represent a
as a linear combination of

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,840
these characters right there.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,130
So I could write a as being
equal to some constant times

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,420
my first basis vector, plus some
other constant, times my

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,140
second basis vector.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,310
And then I can keep going all
the way to a kth constant

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,940
times my k basis vector.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,640
Now, I've used the term
coordinates fairly loosely in

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,060
the past. And now we're going
to have a more precise

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,010
definition.

22
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:25,470
I am going to call these
constants here c1, c2, all the

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,620
way through ck.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm going to call them the--
I'll do it in a new color--

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:47,750
the coordinates of a, with
respect to our basis B, with

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,170
respect to B.

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,930
And we could also write
it like this.

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,930
We could also write I have
my vector a, so I

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,740
have my vector a.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,610
But if I wanted to write my
vector a in coordinates with

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,800
respect to this basis set B,
I would write it like this.

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,690
Put brackets around it, and put
the basis set right there.

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,200
And this says I'm going to write
this in coordinates with

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,340
respect to this basis set.

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,570
So, I will then write
it like this.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm just going to put these
weights there, these constant

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,790
terms, on the on the linear
combination that I have to get

38
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,910
of my basis vectors to get a.

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,880
So there's c1, c2, all
the way to ck.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,600
Now there's one slightly
interesting thing, or maybe

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,680
very interesting thing,
to point out here.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,520
V is as basis of Rn, so
anything in V is also

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,620
going to be in Rn.

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,360
But V has k vectors.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,390
It has dimension k.

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,090
And that k could be as high
as n, but it might

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,550
be something smaller.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,410
Maybe we have two vectors in R3,
in which case v would be a

49
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,920
plane in R3, but we can abstract
that to further

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,740
dimensions.

51
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,050
But when you specify something
that is in our subspace, with

52
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,610
respect to its basis, notice
you only have to have that

53
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,840
many-- the dimension of your
subspaces-- you only have to

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,830
have that many coordinates.

55
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,090
So even though a is a member of
Rn, I only have to give it

56
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,920
k coordinates.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,720
Because, essentially, you're
giving it positions within,

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,850
let's say, if this was a plane,
within the plane that

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,850
is your subspace.

60
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,780
Let me make this a little
bit more concrete.

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,440
Let me do some examples.

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,960
So let's say we have
some subspace.

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,330
Let me clear this out.

64
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,280
Let's say I have a couple
of vectors.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,170
Let's say v1 is the
vector 2, 1.

66
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:52,710
And let's say v2 is
the vector 1, 2.

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,740
Now you might immediately see
that the basis, or the set, of

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:10,230
v1 and v2, this is a basis for
R2, which means that any

69
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,360
vector in R2 can be represented
as a linear

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,540
combination of these guys.

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,240
I could do a visual argument.

72
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,360
Or we also know that, look, R2
is two-dimensional, and we

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,290
have two basic vectors right
here, and they are linearly

74
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:22,860
independent.

75
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,880
You can verify that.

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
In fact, the easiest way to
verify that, is if you just

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,450
take 2, 1 and 1, 2, and you put
it in reduced row echelon

78
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,620
form, you're going to get the
2 by 2 identity matrix.

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,260
You're going to get 1, 0, 0, 1,
and that lets you know that

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,770
this guy and this guy are
both basis vectors.

81
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,200
So, that's all review.

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,460
We've seen that before.

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,320
But let's visualize these.

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,530
Let's visualize these guys.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,450
So if I were to just graph it
in the way we normally graph

86
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,660
these vectors, what does
2, 1 look like? let me

87
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,960
draw some axes here.

88
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,970
Let me draw it.

89
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,220
We'll do it in a different
color.

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,010
   

91
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,640
Let's say that is my vertical
axis, and this is my

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,820
horizontal axis.

93
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,520
And 2, 1 might look like this.

94
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,710
We're going to go out
1, 2, and then we're

95
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,270
going to go up 1.

96
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,460
So that is our vector
1, right there.

97
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,160
That is 2, 1, that's
our vector 1.

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,670
And then 1, 2 might look like,
or it does look like this, if

99
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,680
I draw it in a standard
position.

100
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
1, then you go up 2.

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,980
1, 2 looks like this.

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,740
   

103
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,200
So when we talk about
coordinates with respect to

104
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,290
this basis, let me pick
some member of R2.

105
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,510
I'll engineer it so that I
can easily find a linear

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,150
combination.

107
00:05:48,150 --> 00:06:00,210
Let me take 3 times v1,
plus 2 times v2.

108
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,960
What is that going
to be equal to?

109
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,710
That's going to be equal
to the vector.

110
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,950
So 3 times 2, which is
6, plus 2 times 1.

111
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:15,630
So it's the vector 8, and then
I have the vector 3 times v1,

112
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,900
plus 2 times that.

113
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,300
So 8, 7, right?

114
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,230
3 plus 2 times 2 is for 8, 7.

115
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,215
So if we were to just graph 8,
7 in the traditional way, we

116
00:06:26,215 --> 00:06:33,530
would go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and then we would go up 1,

117
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,870
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

118
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,190
And we would have a vector, I'm
not going to draw it out

119
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,740
here, but it would specify
that point right there.

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,080
That would be this point.

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,590
If you view these as
coordinates, we would view

122
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,940
that as point 8,
7 right there.

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,100
Maybe I'll write it like that.

124
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,240
That's the point 8, 7.

125
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,050
If I wanted to draw the spectrum
in standard position,

126
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,820
I would draw a vector that
ends right there.

127
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,170
Now, we have this is basis
here, this basis B,

128
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,190
represented by these
two vectors.

129
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,635
This is B1 and B2.

130
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,980
And what we want to do is
represent this guy.

131
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,640
Let's say that this is vector--
let me call that

132
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,210
vector a-- so vector
a is equal to 8, 7.

133
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,350
Now, we know that if we wanted
to represent vector a as a

134
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,070
linear combination of my basis
vectors, it's going to be 3

135
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,910
times you v1, plus 2 times v2.

136
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,610
So just given what we just saw
in the earlier part of this

137
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:38,190
video, we can write that the
vector a, with respect to the

138
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,660
basis B-- maybe I'll do it in
the same color as the basis--

139
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,960
with respect to the basis B, is
equal to these weights on

140
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,655
the basis vectors, is
equal to 3 and 2.

141
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:54,700
And let's see if we can visually
understand why this

142
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,770
makes sense.

143
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,930
We're saying that in some new
coordinate system, where this

144
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,390
vector can be represented as 3,
2-- and the way you think

145
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,000
about the new coordinate
system is, in this old

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,960
coordinate system we hashed
out 1's in the horizontal

147
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,350
axis, and that was our
first coordinate.

148
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,130
And we hashed out 1's in
the vertical direction.

149
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,590
That was our second
coordinate.

150
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,480
Now in our new system, what's
our first coordinate?

151
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,810
Our first coordinate is going
to be multiples of v1.

152
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,540
This is v1 or this is v1,
so it's multiples of v1.

153
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
So that's 1 times v1.

154
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,680
Then if we do 2 times v1, we're
going to get, over here,

155
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,049
2 times v1 would get
us to, what?

156
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,400
2 would get us to 4, 2.

157
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,289
3 times v1 would
get us to 6, 3.

158
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:48,150
So let's see, 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

159
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,780
So it's 6 and then 3,
just like that.

160
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,945
And then 4 times v1 would
get us to 8 and 4.

161
00:08:57,945 --> 00:09:01,330
So you can imagine that what I'm
drawing here, this is kind

162
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,670
of the axes, the first-term
axis generated by v1.

163
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,450
So I could draw it-- let me do
it in this blue color-- so you

164
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,946
can imagine it like this.

165
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:16,990
This would be a straight
line, just like that.

166
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,090
And then the coordinate tells me
how many v1's do I have. So

167
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,830
I would hash off the coordinate
system like this.

168
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,490
Instead of doing increments
of 1, I'm going to do

169
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,700
increments of v1.

170
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,780
I'll write it just like that.

171
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,360
As you go 9, 10, we're going
to go up one more to 5,

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,800
something like that.

173
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,870
Now, the second coordinate tells
you increments of v2.

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,080
So this is our first increment
of v2, then our second

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
increment if we go to 4,
is going to be 4, 2.

176
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,850
Just like that.

177
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,892
That's going to be 6 and 3.

178
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:50,060
It's going to be
just like that.

179
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,560
It's going to be 6 and 3.

180
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,970
So it's going to look
something like this.

181
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,830
So if you want to think of it
is a bit of a, well, you

182
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,620
should be thinking of it
as a coordinate system.

183
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,570
You can have this new skewed
graph paper, where any point

184
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,320
you can now specify it as going
in the v1 direction by

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,350
some amount, and then
by going in the v2

186
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,280
direction by some amount.

187
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,130
Let me draw that as
this graph paper.

188
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:19,980
So I could draw another version
of v2, just like that,

189
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,500
just all the multiples of v2.

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,100
I could shift them like that.

191
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,760
I could do another
one like this.

192
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,140
I could do another.

193
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,035
That one is a little bit
not neat enough.

194
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,630
I could do it like that.

195
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,280
I could do-- I think you're
getting the idea.

196
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,630
Let me make that a little
bit neater.

197
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,430
This might have been useful
to do with another tool.

198
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,500
And then I could do all the
multiples of v1 like this.

199
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,320
I'm doing a graph paper
right here.

200
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,350
So it looks something
like this.

201
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,980
It would look something
like this.

202
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,560
It would look something
like this.

203
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,090
And so you can imagine the
skewed graph paper, if I did

204
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,740
it all over the place
with this kind of

205
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,160
green and this blue.

206
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,390
So in our new coordinate system,
we're seeing 3, 2.

207
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,690
So that means 3 times our first
direction, which happens

208
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,950
to be the v1 direction.

209
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,490
It's no longer the horizontal
direction.

210
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,680
It's the v1 direction.

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,500
We're going 1, 2, and then
we go 3, like that.

212
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,470
And then we're going to go
2 in the v2 direction.

213
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,260
So we're going to go 1,
2 in the v2 direction.

214
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,110
And so our point is going
to be right there.

215
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,250
You could imagine
going like this.

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,390
You go 3 in the v1 direction,
and then you go 1, 2 in the v2

217
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,900
direction and you get
to our point.

218
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,980
Or you could go, kind of in
your v2 direction and then

219
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,250
your v1 direction, but either
way you're going to get to

220
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,680
your original point.

221
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,570
So that vector, or the position
specified by the

222
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,930
vector, 8, 7, could just as
easily be specified in our new

223
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,180
coordinate system by the
coordinates 3, 2.

224
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,980
Because we're saying 3 times v1,
and then, plus 3 times v1.

225
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,180
It takes us in this direction.

226
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,850
We're going 3 notches in the v1
direction, and then we're

227
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,570
going 2 notches in
the v2 direction.

228
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,430
And so that's why these are
called coordinates.

229
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,690
You're literally saying how
many spaces in the v1

230
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,430
direction to go, and then how
many spaces in the v2

231
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,250
direction to go.

232
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,460
But this might, I guess, lead
you to the obvious question.

233
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,280
Why haven't we been using
the coordinates before?

234
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,640
Like I might have been
saying all along.

235
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,470
I've been saying all along.

236
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,660
Let's say I have some vector
lowercase b, that is equal to,

237
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,380
I don't know, let's say it's
equal to-- I'll do it in an

238
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,640
R2, just because it's easy to
visualize-- let's say it's

239
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,630
equal to 3 minus 1.

240
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,240
If we were to graph
it it would look

241
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
something like this.

242
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,490
We would go, 1, 2, 3, and
then we would go down 1.

243
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,220
So it would look something
like this.

244
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,970
It would specify this point.

245
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,310
But why have we been calling 3
and negative 1 coordinates?

246
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,110
Why have we been calling 3
and minus 1 coordinates?

247
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,630
We've been doing it
well before we

248
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,490
learned linear algebra.

249
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,440
We called these coordinates all
the way from when we first

250
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,370
learned how to graph.

251
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,680
Why are we calling those
coordinates?

252
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,820
Or how does this meeting of
coordinates relate to these

253
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,030
coordinates with respect
to a basis?

254
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, these are coordinates
with respect to a basis.

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,100
These are actually coordinates
with respect to

256
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,670
the standard basis.

257
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,630
If you imagine, let's see,
the standard basis in

258
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,680
R2 looks like this.

259
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,530
We could have e1, which
is 1, 0, and we have

260
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:40,680
e2, which is 0, 1.

261
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,755
This is just the convention for
the standard basis in R2.

262
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:53,100
And so we could say s is equal
to the set of e1 and e2.

263
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:06,055
Then we say that s is the
standard basis for R2.

264
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:09,080
And it's a standard basis
because these two guys are

265
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,180
orthogonal.

266
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,470
This is 1 in the horizontal
direction.

267
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,130
This is 1 in the vertical
direction.

268
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:22,130
And any vector in R2-- let's say
I have some vector x, y in

269
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:32,440
R2-- it's going to be equal to
x times e1, plus y times e2.

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:39,900
So we can say that if you want
to write some vector x, y, if

271
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,600
you wanted to write with respect
to this standard basis

272
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:53,770
right here, it's going to be
equal to the coordinates by

273
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,270
the definition that we did
earlier in this video of the

274
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,600
basis vectors right there.

275
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,250
Or these weights on our e1's and
e2's, so it's going to be

276
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,010
equal to, well the weight
there is x and the

277
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,780
weight here is y.

278
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,410
So these coordinates that we've
been talking about from

279
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,820
the get-go, these are definitely
coordinates.

280
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,400
They're consistent with our
definition of coordinates in

281
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,300
this video.

282
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,180
But we can maybe be a little
bit more precise.

283
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:25,930
We can now call them the
coordinates with respect to

284
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,480
the standard basis.

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,950
   

286
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,700
Or we could call them, we could
call these right here

287
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,950
the standard coordinates.

288
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,750
   

289
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,910
I just wanted to
point this out.

290
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,600
This might be almost trivially
simple, or a bit obvious.

291
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,370
But I just wanted to show that
our old usage of the word

292
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,210
coordinates was not inconsistent
with this new

293
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,560
definition of coordinates as
being the weights on some

294
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,610
basis vectors.

295
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,290
Because even in our old
coordinates, or the old way we

296
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,970
used them, these really
were weights on our

297
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,270
standard basis vectors.

298
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,533
