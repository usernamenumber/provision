[Intro Music]

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:11,064
We're in the Leopold museum in Vienna, and we're looking at Gustav Klimt's Death and Life.

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:19,528
And he's taking older traditional scenes and reworking them and making them wildly contemporary, wildly modern.

4
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:23,434
This is loosely based on the subject of Dance of Death,

5
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:27,911
which is a medieval subject showing Death coming to people of all ranks.

6
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:33,849
The idea that Death comes to everyone whether you're a peasant or priest or prince.

7
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:38,869
Usually Death holds an hourglass or a scythe.

8
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:41,981
But here, and I think this is very unusual, Death holds a club.

9
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:44,448
And looks much more dangerous and menacing.

10
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:48,014
This skull is looking towards life eagerly.

11
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:55,482
When I say life, I'm referring to this accumulation, almost architecture of human bodies, old and young and new born.

12
00:00:55,482 --> 00:01:01,523
There is this sense of generations and generations of human beings who have been taken by Death.

13
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:07,177
If you look at the overlapping of those bodies, there really is a sense of succession,

14
00:01:07,177 --> 00:01:11,041
of movement forward in time, but not towards anything.

15
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,140
They do seem swept along as though in a dream.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,479
That idea of their eyes closed of the dream, I think is really important.

17
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:26,445
This notion of subconscious or of the dream state, or something that was being developed by Freud in Vienna at this time.

18
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,888
We should say that there are two exceptions to those eyes being closed.

19
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:36,660
One is the infant, and there is a kind of instinctual aspect there. This is not yet a learned consciousness.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,413
And the other eyes that are opened are those of the young woman on the extreme left.

21
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,891
She seems almost crazed, almost delusional.

22
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:49,948
To me it reads like Death on one side and pleasure or sensuality on the other.

23
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:54,376
There is a real mirroring and I think the both figures are intensified because of the other.

24
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,538
Their hands are even somewhat together.

25
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:59,698
One holding the club, one clutching her breasts.

26
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:07,396
We see on both sides that characteristic decorative patterning that we associate with Gustav Klimt so much.

27
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:14,229
On the side of Death we see very dark colours and the shape of cross, clearly allusion to the Church.

28
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:18,594
And maybe the resurrection or afterlife.

29
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:25,622
On the right much brighter colours, shapes suggests flowers decorative patterns that suggest renewal.

30
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,713
That pattern really tends to flatten the entire image.

31
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:39,375
In Europe at this time, we see an interest in the interior, in dream states, in removal from the everyday world.

32
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:46,523
A kind of reaction against the materialism and the quick pace of modern industrial life.

33
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:52,682
This interest in instinctive drives has particular significance in Vienna

34
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:56,646
even more than the symbolist movement in other countries at this time.

35
00:02:56,646 --> 00:03:00,546
It does seem to me a really successful solution to the problem

36
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,969
that the artists have been grappling with for sometime.

37
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:09,286
Which is how do you rescue the profound qualities that art had been able to achieve in history

38
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:17,385
without resorting to history painting or the traditional modes that had been so worn out by the end of the 19th century.

39
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:21,116
Was it possible to find a new arena to explore?

40
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:24,088
And they did, but that arena was an interior one.

41
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:33,474
