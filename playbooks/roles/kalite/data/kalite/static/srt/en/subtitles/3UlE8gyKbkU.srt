00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:06,711
Find the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping three coins.

2
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,867
So let's think about the sample space, here.

3
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:10,797
Let's think about all of the possible outcomes.

4
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:12,133
So I can get all heads.

5
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,533
So, on flip #1, I get a head.

6
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,698
Flip #2, I get a head.

7
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:16,138
Flip #3, I get a head.

8
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:18,800
I could get 2 heads and then a tail.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,732
I could get heads, tail, heads.

10
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:26,308
Or I can get heads, tails, tails.

11
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:30,533
I could get tails, heads, heads.

12
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:33,135
I could get tail, heads, tails.

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,782
I could get tails, tails, heads.

14
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:38,801
Or I could get tails, tails, and tails.

15
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:42,098
These are all the different ways that I could flip three coins.

16
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:45,302
And you could maybe say that this is the first flip, the second flip, and the third flip.

17
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:48,135
Now, so this right over here is the sample space.

18
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,533
There's eight possible outcomes.

19
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,457
Let me write this.

20
00:00:50,457 --> 00:01:02,717
The probability of exactly two heads, exactly... exactly two heads... two, I'll say h's there for short, the probability of exactly two heads.

21
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,132
Well, what is the size of our sample space?

22
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,133
I have eight possible outcomes.

23
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:14,533
So, eight... this is possible outcomes, or the size of our sample space... possible outcomes.

24
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:19,807
And how many of those possible outcomes are associated with this event?

25
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:24,800
You could call this a compound event because there's more than one outcome that's associated with this.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,533
Well, so let's think about exactly... exactly two heads...

27
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,533
This is three heads, so it's not exactly two heads.

28
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,460
This is exactly two heads right over here.

29
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,061
This is exactly two heads right over here.

30
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,129
There's only one head.

31
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,801
This is exactly two heads.

32
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,448
This is only one head, only one head, no heads.

33
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:48,693
So you have [counting] 1, 2, 3 of the possible outcomes are associated with this event.

34
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,107
So you have three possible outcomes.

35
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:54,133
Three outcomes associated with the event.

36
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,798
Three outcomes.

37
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,098
Outcomes.

38
00:01:57,098 --> 00:02:01,464
Satisfy... satisfy this event, or are associated, with this event.

39
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:04,296
So the probability of getting exactly two heads,

40
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:08,467
when flipping three coins is three outcomes satisfying this event

41
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,426
over eight possible outcomes.

42
00:02:10,426 --> 99:59:59,999
So it is three-eighths.
