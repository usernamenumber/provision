1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,762
So I have several groups of these ball-looking things

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,371
and let's think about 
how many balls are in each group.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:05,987
We have: 1

4
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:06,474
2

5
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:06,872
3

6
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:07,291
4

7
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:07,770
5

8
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,206
6

9
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:08,687
7

10
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:09,178
8

11
00:00:09,178 --> 00:00:09,742
9

12
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:10,278
10

13
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:10,835
11

14
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:11,462
12.

15
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:15,140
And what I want to do 
is think about the different ways

16
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,389
of dividing these 12 balls 
into different numbers of groups.

17
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:22,615
So, for example, I could view these 12 balls as:

18
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:26,211
1...so that's 1 group of 3,

19
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,620
2 groups of 3,

20
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,839
3 groups of 3,

21
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,890
4 groups of 3.

22
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:37,514
So I could view 12 as being 4 groups of 3.

23
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,740
And the way that we would write that...
the way that we would write that...

24
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:47,085
is that 12...is that 12 is equal to 
4 groups of 3...

25
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:52,661
...4 groups of 3. 
4 groups of 3.

26
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:58,315
Or another way of reading this
is that 12 is equal to 4 times 3.

27
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,786
If I have 1,

28
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:01,288
2,

29
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:01,922
3,

30
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:02,766
4 groups,

31
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:06,098
and in each of those groups
I have 1, 2, 3 objects...

32
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:09,052
I'm going to have a total of 12 objects.

33
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:14,390
That's not the only way we can get to 12. 
We could also view it as 3 groups of 4.

34
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,783
So let's look at that. So we could have it as:

35
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:21,568
1, 1 group of 4,

36
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,671
2 groups of 4,

37
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:28,473
3 groups...3 groups of four.

38
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:33,618
So now we could view 12 as being 3 groups of 4.

39
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:37,429
Or we could say, we could say that 3...

40
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,840
(let me get the right tool out)

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,182
...we can say that 3, 3 times 4...

42
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:47,501
...3 times 4 is equal to 12.

43
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:53,001
So whether we're doing 4 times 3 or 3 times 4 
they're both going to be equal to twelve.

44
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,908
4 groups of 3 is 12; 3 groups of 4.

45
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:58,951
But we don't have to stop there!

46
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:04,079
We could also view 12 as, 
well we could do it as 2 groups of 6.

47
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:05,710
Let's look at that.

48
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:11,155
It could be...so this is one group of 6 
right over here, so that's one group of 6.

49
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:14,801
That's another group of 6.

50
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:19,933
So, once again we could view this as 2 times 6.

51
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:23,694
2 times 6 will also get us to 12.

52
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,895
Well what about viewing it as 6 groups of 2?

53
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:29,185
Well, we can draw that out, too!

54
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,624
6 groups of 2. So that's 1 group of 2
(let me do that in a different color)

55
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,714
We have...ehhh...this purple color...

56
00:02:36,714 --> 00:02:38,395
We have 1 group of 2,

57
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:39,773
2 groups of 2,

58
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:41,497
3 groups of 2,

59
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,451
4 groups of 2,

60
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:44,694
5 groups of 2,

61
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,909
and 6 groups of 2.

62
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:51,821
So once again, this is all different ways of writing 12.
Something equivalent to 12.

63
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,492
We could write 6 times 2,

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,925
6...6 groups of 2,

65
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:03,900
6 times 2 is also...is also equal 12.

66
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,448
But we don't have to stop there.

67
00:03:06,448 --> 00:03:11,970
We could also literally view 12 as 1 group of 12.

68
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,032
So how would that look?

69
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:16,760
So 1 group of 12. So this whole thing is just...

70
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:22,392
1...1 group...1 group of 12 here.

71
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:28,105
So we could literally say 1...1 times 12...

72
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,196
1 times 12 is equal to 12.

73
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,282
We have 1 entire group of 12,

74
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,114
1 times 12 is equal to 12.

75
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:44,943
And we could think of it the other way around. We could view this as 12 groups of 1. 12 groups of 1.

76
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,342
Let me draw that. So 12 groups of 1.

77
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,711
This is 1 group of 1, 2 groups of 1,

78
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,563
3,

79
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:52,532
4,

80
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,346
5,

81
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,140
6,

82
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,069
7,

83
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,451
8,

84
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:57,850
9,

85
00:03:58,263 --> 00:03:58,856
10,

86
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,311
11,

87
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,613
and 12.

88
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:05,139
12 groups of 1. So we could also write...

89
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,912
...we could also write 12...

90
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,699
12 groups and in each 1, I have 1.

91
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,640
Well that's still going to get me to 12.
