1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,690
One of you all sent a fairly
interesting problem, so I

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,360
thought I would work it out.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,430
The problem is I have a
group of 30 people, so

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,580
30 people in a room.

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,820
They're randomly
selected 30 people.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,490
And the question is what is the
probability that at least 2

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:29,640
people have the same birthday?

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,930
This is kind of a fun question
because that's the size

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,680
of a lot of classrooms.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,260
What's the probability that at
least someone in the classroom

12
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,200
shares a birthday with someone
else in the classroom?

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,740
That's a good way
to phrase as well.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,720
This is the same thing as
saying, what is the probability

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:53,820
that someone shares with
at least someone else.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,570
They could share it with 2
other people or 4 other

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,420
people in the birthday.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,860
   

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,260
And at first this problem seems
really hard because there's

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,810
a lot of circumstances
that makes this true.

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,270
I could have exactly 2 people
have the same birthday.

22
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,170
I could have exactly 3 people
have the same birthday.

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,060
I could have exactly 29 people
have the same birthday and all

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,500
of these make this true, so do
I add the probability of each

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,830
of those circumstances?

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,990
And then add them up and then
that becomes really hard.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,510
And then I would have to
say, OK, whose birthdays

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,280
and I comparing?

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,020
And I would have to
do combinations.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,200
It becomes a really difficult
problem unless you make kind

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,560
of one very simplifying
take on the problem.

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,310
This is the opposite of--
well let me draw the

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,810
probability space.

34
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,250
Let's say that this is
all of the outcomes.

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,630
Let me draw it with
a thicker line.

36
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,250
   

37
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,770
So let's say that's all
of the outcomes of my

38
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,630
probability space.

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,590
So that's 100% of the outcomes.

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,730
   

41
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,000
We want to know-- let me draw
it in a color that won't

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,680
be offensive to you.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,030
That doesn't look that
great, but anyway.

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,620
Let's say that this is the
probability, this area right

45
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,250
here-- and I don't know
how big it really is,

46
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,070
we'll figure it out.

47
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,140
Let's say that this is the
probability that someone

48
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,220
shares a birthday with
at least someone else.

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,410
What's this area over here?

50
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,080
What's this green area?

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,970
Well, that means if these are
all the cases where someone

52
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,170
shares a birthday with someone
else, these are all the area

53
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,850
where no one shares a
birthday with anyone.

54
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,230
   

55
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:45,735
Or you could say, all 30 people
have different birthdays.

56
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:51,430
   

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,850
This is what we're
trying to figure out.

58
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,500
I'll just call it the
probability that

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,630
someone shares.

60
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,170
I'll call it the probability
of sharing, probability of s.

61
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,760
   

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,540
If this whole area is area 1 or
area 100%, this green area

63
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,760
right here, this is going
to be 1 minus p of s.

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,540
This is going to be
1 minus p of s.

65
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,200
Or if we said that this is the
probability-- or another way we

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,310
could say it, actually this is
the best way to think about it.

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,780
If this is different, so
this is the probability

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,610
of different birthdays.

69
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,770
This is the probability
that all 30 people have

70
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,410
30 different birthdays.

71
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,300
No one shares with anyone.

72
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,630
The probability that someone
shares with someone else plus

73
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,460
the probability that no one
shares with anyone-- they all

74
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,960
have distinct birthdays--
that's got to be equal to 1.

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,950
Because we're either going to
be in this situation or we're

76
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,990
going to be in that situation.

77
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,670
Or you can say they're
equal to 100%.

78
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,191
Either way, 100% and 1
are the same number.

79
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,460
It's equal to 100%.

80
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,990
So if we figure out the
probability that everyone has

81
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,830
the same birthday we could
subtract it from 100.

82
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,710
So let's see.

83
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,090
We could we just rewrite this.

84
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,710
The probability that someone
shares a birthday with someone

85
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:11,390
else, that's equal to 100%
minus the probability that

86
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,080
everyone has distinct,
separate birthdays.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,190
And the reason why I'm doing
that is because as I started

88
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,190
off in the video, this is
kind of hard to figure out.

89
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,140
You know, I can figure out the
probability that 2 people have

90
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,520
the same birthday, 5 people,
and it becomes very confusing.

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,560
But here, if I wanted to just
figure out the probability that

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,860
everyone has a distinct
birthday, it's actually a much

93
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,190
easier probability
to solve for.

94
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,830
So what's the probability
that everyone has a

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,440
distinct birthday?

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,300
So let's think about it.

97
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,690
   

98
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,880
Person one.

99
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,370
Just for simplicity, let's
imagine the case that we only

100
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,790
have 2 people in the room.

101
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,770
What's the probably that they
have different birthdays?

102
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,870
Let's see, person one, their
birthday could be 365 days

103
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,520
out of 365 days of the year.

104
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,390
You know, whenever
their birthday is.

105
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,440
And then person two, if we
wanted to ensure that they

106
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,340
don't have the same birthday,
how many days could

107
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,720
person two be born on?

108
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,130
Well, it could be born
on any day that person

109
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,240
one was not born on.

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,080
So there are 364
possibilities out 365.

111
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,550
So if you had 2 people, the
probability that no one

112
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,110
is born on the same
birthday-- this is just 1.

113
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,330
It's just going to be
equal to 364/365.

114
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,740
Now what happens if
we had 3 people?

115
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,470
So first of all the
first person could

116
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,280
be born on any day.

117
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,990
Then the second person could
be born on 364 possible

118
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,390
days out of 365.

119
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,220
And then the third person,
what's the probability that

120
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,810
the third person isn't
born on either of these

121
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,620
people birthdays?

122
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:03,110
So 2 days are taken up, so
the probability is 363/365.

123
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,330
You multiply them out.

124
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:11,480
You get 365 times 36-- actually
I should rewrite this one.

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,420
Instead of saying this is 1,
let me write this as-- the

126
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:21,370
numerator is 365 times
364 over 365 squared.

127
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,140
Because I want you
to see the pattern.

128
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,640
Here the probability is 365
times 364 times 363 over

129
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,610
365 to the third power.

130
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,100
And so, in general, if you just
kept doing this to 30, if I

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,610
just kept this process for 30
people-- the probability that

132
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:55,560
no one shares the same birthday
would be equal to 365 times 364

133
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,280
times 363-- I'll have
30 terms up here.

134
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,760
All the way down to what?

135
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,080
   

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,120
All the way down to 336.

137
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,810
That'll actually be 30
terms divided by 365

138
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,380
to the 30th power.

139
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,220
And you can just type this into
your calculator right now.

140
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,910
It'll take you a little time to
type in 30 numbers, and you'll

141
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,960
get the probability that no one
shares the same birthday

142
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,700
with anyone else.

143
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,900
But before we do that let
me just show you something

144
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,250
that might make it a
little bit easier.

145
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,970
Is there any way that I can
mathematically express

146
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,130
this with factorials?

147
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,730
Or that I could mathematically
express this with factorials?

148
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,380
Let's think about it.

149
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,120
365 factorial is what?

150
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:55,320
365 factorial is equal to 365
times 364 times 363 times--

151
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,710
all the way down to 1.

152
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,870
You just keep multiplying.

153
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,040
It's a huge number.

154
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,830
Now, if I just want the 365
times the 364 in this case,

155
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,610
I have to get rid of all of
these numbers back here.

156
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,690
One thing I could do is I
could divide this thing

157
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,140
by all of these numbers.

158
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,630
So 363 times 362-- all
the way down to 1.

159
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,820
So that's the same thing as
dividing by 363 factorial.

160
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,370
365 factorial divided by 363
factorial is essentially this

161
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,260
because all of these
terms cancel out.

162
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:38,230
So this is equal to 365
factorial over 363 factorial

163
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,725
over 365 squared.

164
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,870
And of course, for this case,
it's almost silly to worry

165
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,000
about the factorials, but it
becomes useful once we have

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,230
something larger than
two terms up here.

167
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,940
So by the same logic, this
right here is going to be equal

168
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:01,780
to 365 factorial over 362
factorial over 365 squared.

169
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,390
And actually, just another
interesting point.

170
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,580
How did we get this 365?

171
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,620
Sorry, how did we get
this 363 factorial?

172
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,250
Well, 365 minus 2
is 363, right?

173
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,940
And that makes sense because we
only wanted two terms up here.

174
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,670
We only wanted two
terms right here.

175
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,760
So we wanted to divide by a
factorial that's two less.

176
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,670
And so we'd only get the
highest two terms left.

177
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,180
This is also equal to-- you
could write this as 365

178
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:36,870
factorial divided by 365 minus
2 factorial 365 minus 2 is 363

179
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,210
factorial and then you just end
up with those two terms

180
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,630
and that's that there.

181
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,580
And then likewise, this right
here, this numerator you could

182
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:54,980
rewrite as 365 factorial
divided by 365 minus 3-- and

183
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,190
we had 3 people-- factorial.

184
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,380
And that should hopefully
make sense, right?

185
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,780
This is the same thing as 365
factorial-- well 365 divided

186
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,090
by 3 is 362 factorial.

187
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,430
And so that's equal to
365 times 364 times

188
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,380
363 all the way down.

189
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,550
Divided by 362 times
all the way down.

190
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,870
And that'll cancel out with
everything else and you'd

191
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,860
be just left with that.

192
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,600
And that's that right there.

193
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,190
So by that same logic, this top
part here can be written as

194
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,160
365 factorial over what?

195
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,660
365 minus 30 factorial.

196
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,360
And I did all of that just so
I could show you kind of the

197
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,200
pattern and because this is
frankly easier to type into a

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,700
calculator if you know where
the factorial button is.

199
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,330
So let's figure out what
this entire probability is.

200
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,710
So turning on the calculator,
we want-- so let's

201
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,790
do the numerator.

202
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:09,820
365 factorial divided by--
well, what's 365 minus 30?

203
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,020
That's 335.

204
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:19,560
Divided by 335 factorial and
that's the whole numerator.

205
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,630
And now we want to divide
the numerator by 365

206
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,610
to the 30th power.

207
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,100
Let the calculator think
and we get 0.2936.

208
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,990
Equals 0.2936.

209
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:45,350
Actually 37 if you rounded,
which is equal to 29.37%.

210
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,550
Now, just so you remember what
we were doing all along, this

211
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,610
was the probability that no one
shares a birthday with anyone.

212
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,180
This was the probability of
everyone having distinct,

213
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,090
different birthdays
from everyone else.

214
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,580
And we said, well, the
probability that someone shares

215
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,930
a birthday with someone else,
or maybe more than one person,

216
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,830
is equal to all of the
possibilities-- kind of the

217
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,800
100%, the probability space,
minus the probability that no

218
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,030
one shares a birthday
with anybody.

219
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,990
So that's equal to
100% minus 29.37%.

220
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,660
Or another way you could write
it as that's 1 minus 0.2937,

221
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,860
which is equal to-- so if I
want to subtract that from 1.

222
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,330
1 minus-- that just
means the answer.

223
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,280
That means 1 minus 0.29.

224
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,630
You get 0.7063.

225
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,720
So the probability that someone
shares a birthday with someone

226
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,420
else is 0.7063--
it keeps going.

227
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,090
Which is approximately
equal to 70.6%.

228
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,250
Which is kind of a neat result
because if you have 30 people

229
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,030
in a room you might say,
oh wow, what are the odds

230
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,580
that someone has the same
birthday as someone else?

231
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,170
It's actually pretty high.

232
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,870
70% of the time, if you have a
group of 30 people, at least 1

233
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,500
person shares a birthday
with at least one other

234
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,260
person in the room.

235
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,990
So that's kind of
a neat problem.

236
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,950
And kind of a neat result
at the same time.

237
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,740
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

238
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:15,900
