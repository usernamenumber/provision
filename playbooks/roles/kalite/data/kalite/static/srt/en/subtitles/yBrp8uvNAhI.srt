1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:02,093
In the video where we introduced
the atom, I went

2
00:00:02,093 --> 00:00:06,042
off a bit about how at the
center of an atom we have the

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:09,009
nucleus, and it's actually a
very small fraction of the

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,026
total volume of the atom.

5
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:13,092
And the electron, even though we
call it a particle, it can

6
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:16,064
really be best described
as kind of a

7
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:19,060
smear around this nucleus.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,098
That although it's a particle,
because of the Heisenberg

9
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:26,073
uncertainty principle, we can
never tell exactly at a given

10
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:29,087
moment where the particle is
and what its momentum is.

11
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:32,047
So to describe it as a particle
is a little bit, I

12
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:35,053
don't know, at best, it's
a little bit strange.

13
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:37,088
And we said that the way that
they describe it, they don't

14
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:42,017
say that this particle is in
an orbit, like the planets

15
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:44,071
around the Sun in orbit
would be like that.

16
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,003
That would be like the
orbit of Halley's

17
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,067
Comet around the Sun.

18
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:51,059
Instead, it can be described
as a probability function

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,092
around the nucleus.

20
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:57,003
So if the nucleus is there, we
have one orbital, actually the

21
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,089
1s orbital, and we'll talk
about that in this video.

22
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:07,084
It'll be a sphere around
the nucleus.

23
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,089
And actually the sphere has
no strict boundary.

24
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:14,043
Whenever you see someone draw
it, they're just saying, where

25
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:17,004
is 90% of the time the
electron going to be.

26
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:18,012
And then they'll cut
off a boundary.

27
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:20,045
And they'll say, OK, it's going
to be within this sphere

28
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,029
and it actually gets denser
as you get into the

29
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:23,026
center of the sphere.

30
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,054
So if this was a cross-section,
it would be

31
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:28,032
really dense in the center, and
it gets less dense, less

32
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:29,034
dense as you go outside.

33
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,032
Which just means that there's
a much higher probability of

34
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:36,056
finding the electron in the 1s
orbital near the center than

35
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:37,065
near the outside.

36
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:40,070
Although this boundary point out
here is just artificial.

37
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,006
You can find the electron
pretty much anywhere.

38
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:45,081
It just has a much lower
probability out

39
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,056
there than in here.

40
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:49,015
But I'll touch on that
in more detail in the

41
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,067
rest of this video.

42
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:54,009
But I wanted to go back
to the Bohr model.

43
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,043
And the Bohr model is the kind
of-- let me write that down.

44
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:58,006
Bohr model.

45
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,023
And sometimes it's
nice to know it's

46
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:01,056
named after Niels Bohr.

47
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,054
And don't think that this
guy was some slouch.

48
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:05,015
He was at the cutting
edge and this wasn't

49
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:06,028
even that long ago.

50
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,055
This was roughly about
100 years ago.

51
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:12,097
So already we're talking about
things that you can probably

52
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,062
dig up research papers in your
library not too long ago where

53
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:17,059
people are debating some
of these issues.

54
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:20,059
But in the Bohr model, that's
the model where he kind of

55
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:24,046
modeled electrons as planets
revolving around a star or

56
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:25,096
around the Sun.

57
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:28,094
And that model is actually
useful, at least it's useful

58
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:32,037
in my brain, to conceptualize
the idea of energy states.

59
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:36,013
So this is an electron around
the nucleus, right?

60
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:38,040
It's moving around
in an orbit.

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,006
And we know, and I want to
emphasize, orbits aren't

62
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,006
really what happen.

63
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,052
Orbitals are what happen.

64
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:50,075
And orbitals are more like
probability functions as to

65
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:53,074
where you might find the
electron, while an orbit is a

66
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:56,074
very kind of classical,
mechanical way of describing

67
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:59,061
the path of a classical
object, like a

68
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:00,078
planet around a star.

69
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:02,052
I don't want to say the
analogy too much.

70
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:06,087
But if you view this model,
the idea of energy levels

71
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,090
start to make sense.

72
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,084
For example, if I have something
orbiting, if I have

73
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:15,002
a planet orbiting a
star, like that.

74
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:19,038
And if it were to have more
energy, perhaps its orbit

75
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:20,093
would become more elliptical.

76
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:24,015
Maybe for some reason I put some
more energy into this.

77
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:27,063
I had a little rocket booster on
this planet right now that

78
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,043
temporarily put some
energy into it.

79
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:35,099
Instead of going down this path,
maybe it'll push it this

80
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,094
way, and maybe it'll
accelerate it

81
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:38,084
a little bit faster.

82
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,053
And maybe it'll go something
like this.

83
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,018
I don't know, I haven't
done the math.

84
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,084
But in general it's going to
have a little bit higher

85
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:46,015
kinetic energy, so it's going
to get a little bit further

86
00:03:46,015 --> 00:03:47,044
away from the planet.

87
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:50,058
And then maybe if I
rocket-boosted it again, its

88
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,022
path would look something
like this.

89
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:55,006
   

90
00:03:55,006 --> 00:04:00,055
Its orbit would get further
pushed out and as it

91
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:02,074
approaches the planet, it
actually would achieve faster

92
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,002
speeds as it approaches the
planet with gravity.

93
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,056
And there's a couple of
interesting things here.

94
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:11,056
One, obviously, the planet or
the rocket that has this orbit

95
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,081
has more energy.

96
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:16,025
   

97
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:26,056
This one right here will have
more energy than, let's say,

98
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:27,052
this one over here.

99
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,051
And energy, even though we're
talking in the quantum world

100
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,050
and this is just analogy,
because we know orbits don't

101
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,026
really apply, but energy is
really the same energy that we

102
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,016
talk about in anything.

103
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:40,061
And energy is the ability to
do work or transmit heat or

104
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,036
create heat.

105
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,016
So, you know, if you're not
doing work and you have

106
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,099
energy, you might kind
of waste the work

107
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,094
by generating heat.

108
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:48,031
We'll talk more about that
in future videos.

109
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,064
But it's the same idea, right?

110
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,097
If I had a little rocket pack
and put some energy into this,

111
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:57,056
or pushed it somehow, I might
get into this higher orbit.

112
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:00,094
The idea of orbitals is the same
thing, except obviously

113
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,080
they aren't these well-defined
paths.

114
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,033
That as electrons get more
energy, and that energy can be

115
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:10,097
given to the electron, mainly
through light waves, or

116
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:13,037
electromagnetic waves can be
put onto the electron.

117
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:14,085
And when we do quantum
mechanics, we'll do that in

118
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:15,064
more detail.

119
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,062
But, essentially, if you view
light as a bunch of packets,

120
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,043
as a bunch of photons, and a
photon hits an electron in a

121
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:24,094
certain energy state, all of a
sudden it will enter a higher

122
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:27,054
energy state.

123
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:32,025
And maybe it'll go to this
probably distribution that's a

124
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,085
shell around that one.

125
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:37,098
And maybe if, after it gets
excited-- these are words that

126
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:41,050
you hear physicists and chemists
say a lot-- but

127
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,055
excited just means that energy
was put into the electron and

128
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,064
it went to a higher
energy state.

129
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:48,092
And it might stay there or it
might just want to go back to

130
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,006
its lower energy state.

131
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:53,025
So when it goes back to its
lower energy state, it would

132
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:55,085
emit the photon back, and that's
actually why you see

133
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,059
some things sometimes glow.

134
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:59,092
But we'll talk more about that
in the future, as well.

135
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,098
But I really want to give this
intuitive point, because in

136
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:04,069
the rest of chemistry and in a
lot of physics people talk a

137
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:07,020
lot about energy states, or
the electron going into a

138
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,072
higher or lower energy state,
and that's just the general

139
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:15,024
idea, is that an electron in a
kind of higher orbital has had

140
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,067
energy put into it, although
it wants to get back to its

141
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,080
lower orbital.

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,048
Now you might ask, how
can an electron

143
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,085
stay in a higher orbital?

144
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:24,093
For example, what if an electron
just stayed, what if

145
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,043
we already had two electrons
in this orbital over here?

146
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:31,064
And we'll talk a little bit
about how the different

147
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:32,095
orbitals get filled.

148
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,088
But I want to give you the
intuition first. Let's say you

149
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:36,058
had two electrons.

150
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,079
They're just all over
this place.

151
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,017
You can't even pinpoint them.

152
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:41,063
And then I were to add
a third electron.

153
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:44,063
So you might say, oh, the lowest
energy state is this

154
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:47,085
magenta inner sphere
that I just drew.

155
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:50,006
Why wouldn't that third
electron go there?

156
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,049
Well, my intuition is that,
well there's already two

157
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:56,058
electrons there, and although
the electrons are attracted to

158
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:59,018
the nucleus because the nucleus
has all the positive

159
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,085
charge in it, and the electrons
have all the

160
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:04,012
negative charge, it's repelled
by these two electrons.

161
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:06,043
Because negative, like charges
repel each other.

162
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:09,069
So it will want to stay away
from these two electrons.

163
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,060
And so it will go to the
next energy state.

164
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,051
It'll maybe go into this
shell out here.

165
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,058
And the other interesting thing
about energy states--

166
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,039
and this is key to chemistry
when we start talking about

167
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,089
reactivity and how something
might react with something

168
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:26,063
else, and why would it -- is
that things at a high energy

169
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:29,075
state, for example if we use the
orbit analogy, this high

170
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:35,018
energy state, in the case of
planets they get further from

171
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:37,031
the body that they're kind
of attracted to, so the

172
00:07:37,031 --> 00:07:39,030
gravitational force is weaker.

173
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,052
Or in the case of electrons,
when they get further away

174
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:45,036
from a high energy state,
the coulomb

175
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,025
force is weaker, right?

176
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:50,017
The charges we talk about when
we talk about electrons and

177
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,056
protons, those are the
coulomb forces.

178
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:54,012
So this is a negative charge
and then you have positive

179
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,031
charges in the center.

180
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,032
But it gets further away,
I guess is the best way

181
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:57,098
to think about it.

182
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:00,033
And so the force from the
nucleus is weaker, so they're

183
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:02,048
easier to pluck off.

184
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,038
They're easier to pluck off
and maybe share with other

185
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,098
atoms. Or maybe to give to other
atoms, and we'll talk a

186
00:08:08,098 --> 00:08:10,076
lot about that when we
talk about bonding.

187
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,048
But I wanted to give you
this intuition first.

188
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:15,035
So then the next question that
might arise is, well, so how

189
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:18,018
do the electrons fill the
different orbitals, and what

190
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,099
do those orbitals actually
look like?

191
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,017
And I've cut and pasted
some interesting

192
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,044
graphics from Wikipedia.

193
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:27,008
So here are the orbitals.

194
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,012
Here are the different
orbitals.

195
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:31,037
And so there's two aspects
to the orbital.

196
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:34,009
One is its shell, its
energy shell.

197
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,061
And that's given by this
number here, n.

198
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,096
That's the energy shell.

199
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,054
And just so you know,
everything

200
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,092
kind of fits together.

201
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:46,025
Those energy shells correspond
to periods in

202
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,037
the periodic table.

203
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,087
So a period on the periodic
table is literally

204
00:08:49,087 --> 00:08:50,090
just a row in it.

205
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:59,005
So this is period one in the
periodic table, right there

206
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,097
all the way to helium.

207
00:09:00,097 --> 00:09:01,078
That's period one.

208
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,039
It's just the first row.

209
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:09,035
And that means that the elements
in that first period,

210
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:12,051
that their electrons will fill
the first energy shell.

211
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:17,011
So for example, hydrogen
has one proton.

212
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,067
And everything we do, we're
going to assume neutral atoms.

213
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:22,087
So we can take-- we learned in
the last video, that the

214
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:27,044
atomic number tells you how many
protons there are, right?

215
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:30,064
This is how many protons
there are in hydrogen.

216
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:33,012
But if we assume it's a neutral
atom, we can say that

217
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:34,065
this is also the number
of electrons.

218
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:38,021
So we can use the atomic number
also as an indicator of

219
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,063
how many electrons in
a neutral atom.

220
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,000
So this has one electron.

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,052
Where does it go?

222
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:45,017
Well, it's in the first period,
so it's going to go

223
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,011
into the first energy shell.

224
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,062
And so the first electron
will go right here in

225
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:55,041
the 1s energy shell.

226
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,030
So if we wanted to write the
electron configuration for

227
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,042
hydrogen, we would write--
so hydrogen, the electron

228
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:08,057
configuration, it's in the
first energy cell, at 1s.

229
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:10,077
And there's only one
electron there.

230
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:14,008
And what does that first
orbital subshell, that

231
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:14,097
s-shell, look like?

232
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:15,097
It's just a sphere.

233
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,076
It's actually what I just drew
at the top of the video.

234
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,087
It's literally just a sphere.

235
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,082
And if I were to draw a
cross-section of it, it gets

236
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:23,054
denser in the center and
then it gets less

237
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:24,087
dense as you go outside.

238
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:28,003
And in the last video I showed
you what the helium, you could

239
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,075
kind of say, the orbital
function looks like.

240
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,045
And you saw, it was really dark
and dense in the middle

241
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,028
and it got more sparse
and grayer and

242
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:35,064
whiter as you went outside.

243
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:40,096
So what is helium's electron
configuration?

244
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:45,058
Well, in each of these
subshells-- and I'll be a

245
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,055
little bit more specific in
probably the next video,

246
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:51,034
because I'm pretty much out
of time-- you can put two.

247
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:54,008
I guess in each of the geometric
configurations for

248
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:57,017
each subshell, you can
put two electrons.

249
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:59,062
And we'll do that in some
detail in the future.

250
00:10:59,062 --> 00:11:03,037
So the configuration
for helium.

251
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,082
It's in the first period.

252
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:07,055
So it's 1s2.

253
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:13,051
So in the s subshell within the
first period or the first

254
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:17,037
energy shall, it has two
electrons there.

255
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,035
Fascinating.

256
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,094
So what about lithium?

257
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:23,030
Lithium, right here.

258
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,089
Also the name of an
Evanescence song.

259
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:30,001
I think it's the name of an
Evanescence song because it's

260
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,053
used to treat depression, or at
least in the past it's been

261
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:34,061
used to treat depression.

262
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,033
So, lithium.

263
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,001
What is its electron
configuration?

264
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,045
So the first electron
goes into 1s1.

265
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,076
The second electron
goes into 1s2.

266
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,027
And when I say the first
or second, I'm

267
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:45,062
saying energy states.

268
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,067
So the first electron
wants to go into the

269
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,080
lowest energy state.

270
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,035
That's in the s1.

271
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:51,024
Then the second electron
also wants to go there.

272
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:54,037
And two electrons can fit in
that first energy state, or

273
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:57,051
that first sub-orbital,
or that first shell.

274
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,048
So then it becomes 1s2.

275
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:00,072
Then lithium.

276
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:03,053
It fills that first 1s2.

277
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:07,075
It fills the first energy shell
and that first subshell,

278
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,016
which is the S-shape.

279
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:11,069
And so now it has to go to the
second energy shell, and that

280
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:14,034
works out relative to what I
told you before, because it's

281
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:16,092
in the second period.

282
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:21,057
The second period is
that right there.

283
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,005
Right?

284
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:22,097
It's in the second period.

285
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:28,019
So its electron configuration
is going to be 1s2.

286
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,025
Two of its electrons fill just
the way helium filled.

287
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,060
And then its third electron
will be 2s1.

288
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,042
   

289
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,098
So that's its electron
configuration.

290
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:40,087
What do I mean by 2s1?

291
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:44,052
Well, so, lithium is going to
have two electrons in that

292
00:12:44,052 --> 00:12:45,096
little dot that I
overwrote it.

293
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:48,087
And then around that dot,
there's another shell, which

294
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:50,025
is the second energy shell.

295
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,096
And it's going to have one
electron in there.

296
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,025
So let me see if I
can draw that.

297
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:59,007
So it's going to have one
probability, I guess, sphere,

298
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,012
where the first two electrons
are going to reside.

299
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:03,032
And if this is a cross-section,
that third

300
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,050
electron is going to reside in
it in a probability shell

301
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,097
around that.

302
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:09,052
When I draw these, that's not
like the electron is exactly

303
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,054
there in the orbital.

304
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:14,021
I'm just drawing where you're
just doing a cutoff, where you

305
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,011
say it's a 90% chance of
finding the electron.

306
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,087
The electron could show up
there or there or there.

307
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:21,050
But this would be a very low
probability, while right here

308
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,087
would be a very, very
high probability.

309
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:25,034
Anyway, I'm out of time
in this video.

310
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,042
I'm going to continue this
discussion in the next video.

311
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,028
And I'll start talking about
the more bizarro shapes the

312
