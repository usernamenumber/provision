1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,550
What I want to do in this video is how supply and / or demand might change

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,590
based on changes on some factors of the market

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,580
and then think about what that might do to the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,210
So let's say at some period, this is what the supply curve looks like,

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,320
and this is what the demand looks like

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,310
and then all of a sudden this thing happens.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,910
A new disease resistant apple is invented what's likely to happen for the next period?

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,280
Well a new disease resistant apple being invented,

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,630
this is something that clearly impacts the growers and clearly impacts the suppliers.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,520
All of a sudden you'll have fewer apples vulnerable to disease

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,910
and so they will be able to produce more apples,

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:55,930
so at any given price point this will shift the quantity of apples supplied up,

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:05,590
or you could say that entire supply curve is shifted to the right or supply goes up,

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,220
and obviously, if now we have disease resistant apples

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,660
even our minimum price of producing apples is lower.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,480
Now, when we have supply curve shifted this way, shifted to the right

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,950
what happens to the equilibrium price?

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,780
Well our old equilibrium price was over here,

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,070
our new equilibrium price..so this is old one

20
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,100
and this is our new equilibrium price,

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,050
we're assuming that the demand has not changed at all

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,250
so this is our new equilibrium price

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,010
so our new equilibrium price is lower, so the price went down.

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,300
And you don't have to, you could've probably reason through that before taking an e-class

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,520
But this way you have some way to think about it,

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,710
think about how the curves are changing.

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,990
Now let's think about this scenario.

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,240
So this is before, so all of these examples, this is the graph is what happened before.

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,940
the event came out, so this is before

30
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,370
and the studies release on how apples prevent cancer. So what is that likely to do?

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,320
Well no one want cancer

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,670
and more people would be eager to have apples,

33
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,280
this will change customer preferences.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,210
they will prefer apples even more when they're..when they're at the supermarket.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,790
So this is clearly affecting demand customer preferences

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,790
and at the given price customers will want to get,

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,940
people will demand higher quantity of apples,

38
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,120
quantity demanded of the apples would go up.

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,810
So the demand curve will shift to the right, or you could say that demand would go up

40
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:40,850
so that's the new demand curve, so here the demand goes up,

41
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,150
and let me write over here in this situation supply went up,

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,390
here demand goes up, and what happens to the price?

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,660
This is our old equilibrium price

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,190
and this is our new equilibrium price

45
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,660
The price is clearly went up

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,190
Actually over here, let's think about the quantity too in this first situation

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,360
This is our old equilibrium quantity; this is our new equilibrium quantity

48
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,100
Quantity went up which makes sense

49
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,420
If you have fewer apples dying, price went down, more people want to buy it

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,810
Here, price went up and what happened to quantity?

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,290
Quantity. This is our old equilibrium quantity; this is our new equilibrium quantity

52
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,250
Quantity also went up

53
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,420
More people just want to buy apples; they don't want to get cancer

54
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,020
Now let's think about these scenarios right over here

55
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,180
The pear cider industry launches an ad campaign

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,700
For the sake of this, let's assume the same growers who grow apples can also grow pears.

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,340
That makes it interesting

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,740
So you have a couple of interesting things

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,840
By launching this advertising campaign -- we assume it's a good advertising campaign --

60
00:03:50,860 --> 00:04:01,060
this will clearly make demand go up for pear cider relative to apple cider

61
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,690
Most people when they think of cider, they think of apple cider

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,500
Now all of a sudden, pear cider comes out. It'll make demand for apple cider go down

63
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,540
So this is, apple cider demand will go down

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,590
If the apple cider demand goes down,

65
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,990
the apple cider producers are going to demand fewer apples

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:31,140
This means apple demand will go down

67
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,390
At any given price point, apple demand will go down

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,340
So the apple demand curve will shift to the left

69
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,940
I should say at any given price point, the quantity demanded will go down

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:48,010
so the entire curve, the entire relationship will shift to the left

71
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,730
Now that is not all that might happen

72
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,940
because if you think about it from the suppliers' point of view

73
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,450
I don't know if this is really the case, but let's assume

74
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,220
that the farmers who grow apples can also grow pears

75
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,350
Well, they might say, well, now that there's more demand for pears

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,600
they're doing this advertising campaign

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,970
and probably the price of pears has gone up

78
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,580
They might say, well, I'm going to devote more of my land to pears and

79
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,620
less of my land to apples

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:24,990
And so the apple supply might go down

81
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,950
It also shift to the left. So they're both shifting to the left

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,640
Now what is likely to happen here?

83
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,340
The demand went down and the supply went down; they both shifted to the left

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,490
Well, here the way I drew it.

85
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,240
This was our old equilibrium price; this is our new equilibrium price

86
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,240
It actually looks the way that I drew it right over here that it did not change

87
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,340
The equilibrium quantity definitely

88
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,850
This was our old equilibrium quantity; this is our new equilibrium quantity

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,000
Clearly the quantity went down. It was a bad day for apples

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,980
but the price didn't change because at least in the example

91
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,700
we assume that the farmers also produced fewer apples

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,410
It turns out that I can have drawn it in multiple ways. Let me draw it in different ways here

93
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,680
So the quantity definitely--

94
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,040
So let's think about other scenarios. Let me draw it slightly different

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,810
Let's say that the supply goes down even more dramatically

96
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,740
Let's say that the supply shifts all the way

97
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,260
the supply shifts really far back. Now what happens?

98
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,680
Well now our equilibrium price

99
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,850
because the reduction in supply was more extreme than the reduction in the demand

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,040
Now -- and it really depends on how the curve shapes and all that

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,400
The main thing is to reason through so as to see what the actually results are

102
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,290
but in this situation, all of a sudden, the price went up,

103
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,120
but the quantity definitely still went down

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,700
So in this case, the one thing that you're always going to be sure

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,570
is that the quantity went down but the price went up because this effect

106
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,690
The supply went down much more than the demand did. So the price went up

107
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,130
Now I could have done another scenario where maybe

108
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,380
the supply barely barged or maybe the demand went down dramatically

109
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,890
Let me draw it where the supply barely barges

110
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,020
So maybe the supply, it only gets shifted a little bit to the left

111
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,610
So maybe the supply curve looks like this

112
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,380
Now all of a sudden, quantity definitely goes down

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,330
So in all of the scenarios, the quantity will go down

114
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,290
But I've just done 3 scenarios where the price could be neutral,

115
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,810
the price could go up or the price could go down. So you actually don't know

116
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,730
what is going to happen to price based on this

117
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,960
You'd actually have to look at the actual curve and see what the new equilibrium prices are

118
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:49,590
Now let's look at this. The apple pickers unionize and demand wage increases

119
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,300
So this is an issue for the suppliers

120
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,480
So all of a sudden, one of their inputs, one of the costs of production

121
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,970
which is labor has gone up

122
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,350
So the cost of production has gone up

123
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,020
Now at a given price point, they're less profitable

124
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,610
less willing to produce apples

125
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,780
So at a given price point--so we're talking about the suppliers

126
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,840
at a given price point they will supply a lower quantity

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,350
So this is going to lower supply

128
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,520
When you lower supply, what's going to happen?

129
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,000
Well your equilibrium quantity, this was our old one, this is our new one

130
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,430
equilibrium quantity definitely goes down

131
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,670
And what happened to the price, assuming nothing changes to the demand?

132
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,310
So this was our old equilibrium price; this is our new equilibrium price; it went up

133
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,030
Quantity went down and price went up

134
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,430
I encourage you to--I should've told you at the beginning to try these for yourself

135
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,130
but I encourage you to try these out with different situations

136
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,840
Think of situations yourself

137
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,280
and even think about different markets other than the apple market
