1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,900
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,880
It's the morning after Thanksgiving

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,270
and I'm still feeling sick with food,

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,140
but I will move forward and do SAT videos.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,220
So we are on the third test

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,900
in The Official SAT Study Guide on page 518.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,360
This is section two,

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,980
so it's the first math section in this third test.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,720
And let's get started with the problems.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:39,500
The first problem is 3x plus 9 is equal to 5x plus 1,

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,460
and they want to know x.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,980
So this just a straightforward algebra problem.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,460
Well, what we can do is,since we don't have negative numbers,

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,500
let's subtract 1 from both sides.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,490
So you get 3x plus 8 is equal to 5x.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,990
Subtract 3x from both sides,you get 8 is equal to 2x.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,560
Divide both sides by 2, you get 4 is equal to x,

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,360
or x is equal to 4, choice D.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
Problem number two.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,990
That was just a straightforward problem.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,280
Problem number two.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,690
They give us a little sequence here,

23
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:28,460
so let's see, 7, 15, 31, 63, and it just keeps going.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,800
And it says, the first term in the sequence was 7,

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,010
and each term after the first is determined

26
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,330
by multiplying the preceding term by m, and then adding n.

27
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,280
So we multiplied by m and then added n.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,310
OK, what is the value of m?

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,180
Well, you can just look at what they're doing, right?

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,670
What do you have to multiply 7 by and add to get to 15?

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,440
Well, 7 times 2, plus 1 is equal to 15, right?

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,330
7 times 2, plus 1 is equal to 15.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,820
And then if you do 15 times 2, plus 1, you get 31.

34
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,890
15 times 2, plus 1 is equal to 31, and so forth.

35
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,310
31 times 2, plus 1 is equal to 63, right?

36
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,690
So in general, you're taking-- they're saying,

37
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,060
each term after the first is determined

38
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,830
by multiplying the preceding term by m, and then adding p.

39
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,860
So we're multiplying by 2 and then adding 1.

40
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,550
And they want to know what m is,so we're multiplying by 2.

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,440
So the choice is B.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,100
Next problem, number three.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,260
And I'll switch colors for this one.

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,640
On number three, I went to a bolder yellow.

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,310
OK, so that was two tables,

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,340
they're T-shirts, so there's color.

47
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,010
They have red, white,and blue.

48
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:19,940
And then under size they have small, medium, large,

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,000
and extra large.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,220
The table above shows the different colors and sizes

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,930
of T-shirts that are available at Independence High School.

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,110
How many different combinations of color and size

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,850
are possible?

54
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,230
Well, for each color there are four sizes, right?

55
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,360
So you just multiply the number of colors

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,040
times the number of sizes, right?

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,220
There's four reds, four whites, four blues.

58
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:49,170
So it's 3 times 4 is equal to 12, choice B.

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,370
Once again, that was just a very straightforward problem,

60
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,690
no real tricks there.

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,710
Problem number four.

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,560
We're just going through these problems.

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,280
For which of the following functions is-- and they write--

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,880
let me clear this because this might take some space.

65
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,720
OK, so they say,

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,410
for which of these functions is the following true:

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:20,050
f of negative 3 is greater than f of 3?

68
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,530
And here are their choices.

69
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:29,680
So choice a: f of x is equal to 4x squared.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,490
Well, in this situation, we can just look at this.

71
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,480
f of negative 3 and f of 3 is going to be the same thing,

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,780
because when you square the x term,

73
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,820
f of negative 3 is going to be 4 times 9,

74
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,400
which is the same thing as f of 3, right?

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,840
So that's not going to help us.

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,260
I got the 9 because I squared the negative 3,

77
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,320
or squared the 3, so this isn't the right choice.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,470
f of 3 is equal to f of negative 3, choice a.

79
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,220
Choice b: f of x is going to be equal to 4.

80
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,420
Well, once again, this isn't going to be our choice,

81
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,210
because f of x is the same number no matter what, right?

82
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,380
It's 4, so there's no way that f of negative 3

83
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,970
is going to be greater than f of 3.

84
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,170
So b is not our answer.

85
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:22,300
Choice c says f of x is equal to 4 over x.

86
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,800
Well, this has possibility.

87
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,470
So f of negative 3 is what?

88
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,270
Minus 4/3.

89
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,180
And f of 3-- well, no, this isn't going to work.

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,790
It's going to be positive 4/3,so actually f of 3

91
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,010
is larger than f of minus 3.

92
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,400
So that doesn't work.

93
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:52,140
Choice e: f of x is equal to 4 minus x to the third.

94
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,000
This has potential, because f of negative 3 is what?

95
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,980
It's 4 minus minus 27, which equals 31,

96
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,670
while f of 3 is 4 minus 27, which equals minus 24.

97
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,810
So f of negative 3 is larger than f of 3.

98
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,540
So our answer is e.

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,470
Next problem.

100
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,510
We don't have to do the last one,

101
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,960
because we already found one that fits our answer

102
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,710
and that solves our problem. Different colors.

103
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,750
OK, I will switch to this color.

104
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,990
OK, five.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,220
The force required to stretch a spring

106
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,990
beyond its natural length is proportional

107
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,820
to how far the spring is being stretched.

108
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,320
And if you've taken physics,you'd probably see this.

109
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,740
The force necessary is equal to some k, right?

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,020
Which is the proportionality constant times

111
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,170
how far you're stretching.

112
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,270
That's all they're saying, right?

113
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,790
The force required to stretch a spring

114
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,320
beyond its natural strength

115
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,550
is proportional--so that's what k means, proportional--

116
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,520
to how far the spring is being stretched.

117
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,150
x is how far its being stretched.

118
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,670
If a force of 15 pounds-- so when F--

119
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:18,410
if a force of 15 pounds stretches a spring 8 centimeters--

120
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,170
so 15 pounds stretches 8 centimeters--

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,730
what force, in pounds,

122
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,230
is needed to stretch the spring 20 centimeters

123
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,540
beyond its natural length?

124
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,520
So we can just solve for k in this equation

125
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,160
and then apply it here, right?

126
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
This is x.

127
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,700
So 15 is equal to k times 8,

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,990
or we could say k is equal to 15 over 8.

129
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,700
So we know that k is equal to 15 over 8.

130
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,840
And then here we have--

131
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,830
well,what happens when x is 20, what is F?

132
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,560
Well then, F is equal to k, 15 over 8,

133
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,720
times how far this thing needs to be stretched

134
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,160
beyond its natural length.

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,250
So 15 over 8 times 20. What is this?

136
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,580
So we can divide the top and the bottom by 4.

137
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,330
So this goes 5, 2. And what's 5?

138
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,520
What's 5 times 15? 5 times 15, 75. So it's 75 over 2.

139
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,950
And that's a strange number,

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,730
but it looks like we do have choices that match that.

141
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,130
And that's 37.5, which is choice E.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,090
Next problem.

143
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,790
Actually, I've probably run out of time,

144
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,370
so I will do the next problem in the next video.

145
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,270
See you soon.
