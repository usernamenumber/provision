1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,180
I told you, in the
last video, that

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,500
epoxides are very reactive.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,430
That this little triangle right
here, this equilateral

5
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,510
triangle, is highly strained,
highly unstable.

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,950
So it makes it want to do
something, get out of this

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,870
configuration.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,550
What I want to do,
in this video, is

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,180
to show you a reaction.

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,960
What we have, right here, and we
saw this in the last video.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,065
I've drawn a couple
of more hydrogens.

12
00:00:21,065 --> 00:00:22,900
And I've actually drawn a
little bit of the three

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,990
dimensional nature of the
bonds right here.

14
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,240
Because it'll matter.

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,870
This is cyclo-.

16
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,430
And remember, you can just
pretend like this triangle

17
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,500
here, if it was replaced with
a double bond, this would be

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,750
cyclohexene.

19
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:42,240
   

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,140
But because, instead of a double
bond right here, we

21
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,430
have these bonds to
this oxygen, this

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,130
is cyclohexene oxide.

23
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,090
   

24
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,500
Let's think about what would
happen if we had some

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,380
cyclohexene oxide mixed
in with water.

26
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,090
And we have some type of maybe
acid catalyst in there.

27
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,260
So it will allow some
extra hydrogen

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,510
protons to float around.

29
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,010
So we have water.

30
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,280
But since we actually put some
acid catalyst there-- and it

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,300
could really be any acid
catalyst, anything that would

32
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,140
increase the hydrogen proton
concentration-- we're more

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,430
likely to have some hydronium
ions floating around.

34
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,830
And we know what hydronium
ions look like.

35
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,740
They look like water with an
extra proton, with an extra

36
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,640
hydrogen on them.

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,360
So hydronium ions
look like this.

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,670
This is water.

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,370
Let me do it in a different
color since I already used the

40
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,420
blue for the cyclohexene
oxide.

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,380
So this is water right here.

42
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,230
   

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,420
What happens to get hydronium
is the oxygen in the water

44
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,030
takes a proton from someplace
else, from some acid, the acid

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,480
catalyst, in this case.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,150
It would essentially give
an electron to it.

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,520
If this electron gets given to
some hydrogen proton, the

48
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,750
ending result will
look like this.

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,220
You have a bond formed with
another hydrogen.

50
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,430
And now, you have a
positive charge.

51
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,070
You have a positive charge on
the oxygen because it gave

52
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,020
away an electron.

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,940
This is hydronium.

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,470
We've seen it many times.

55
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,830
And this is what results if
you put an acid in water.

56
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,810
It will increase the hydronium
concentration.

57
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,590
You'll see more and
more of this.

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,110
So what's likely to happen if we
have cyclohexene oxide with

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,320
water as a solvent, but we also
have a good amount of

60
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,670
hydronium floating around?

61
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,450
The more acid we put in, the
more hydronium we'll have.

62
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,060
Well, a possible reaction is,
well let's see, this oxygen is

63
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,230
just as likely, or it may want
to get a hydrogen proton just

64
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,860
as much as a hydronium.

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,780
So if they bump into each other
in the exact right way,

66
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,570
this oxygen, right here, could
give an electron to that

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,670
hydrogen right there.

68
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,560
And then the original, this
orange hydronium, or this

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,590
orange oxygen right here, can
take its electron back.

70
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,820
If that happens, what
do we end up with?

71
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,060
Well, let's see.

72
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,820
So if that happened, now we
have-- Let me draw this

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,720
original molecule.

74
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,590
It will no longer be cyclohexene
oxide exactly.

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,750
Because it just got
a hydrogen proton.

76
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,090
It's an intermediary now.

77
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,310
Let me try my best to
draw it though.

78
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,420
All right.

79
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,790
We have that.

80
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,515
Then, we have the oxygen popping
out of the page.

81
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:34,730
   

82
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,120
It had these two extra electron
pairs, but now it

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,900
gave one of its electrons
to this proton.

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,630
So now, it gave one of its
electrons to this hydrogen

85
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,500
right here.

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,130
I call it a proton, because a
hydrogen without an electron

87
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,900
is just a proton.

88
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,510
It doesn't have another neutron
inside of the nucleus.

89
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,700
So you have the hydrogen
over there.

90
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,870
Now, since this oxygen gave away
an electron, it now has a

91
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,110
positive charge.

92
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,950
Let me draw these two purple
hydrogens that

93
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,940
are behind the page.

94
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,810
So that's one hydrogen there.

95
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,230
One hydrogen there.

96
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,040
Obviously, there's other
hydrogens on these carbons.

97
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,380
But if I drew it, it
would take a while.

98
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,740
It would make a whole
diagram messy.

99
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,960
But it's always assumed
that a neutral carbon

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
will have four bonds.

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,270
And of course, this thing right
here is now just water.

102
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,810
This thing took its
electron back.

103
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,160
I'll draw it here.

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,610
This thing took its
electron back.

105
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,750
And now, it's water.

106
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,490
It could be this one.

107
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,320
But there's obviously tons
of water around.

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
So I could even draw other
water molecules.

109
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,660
It doesn't have to
just be that one.

110
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,120
Now, what is a likely
to happen?

111
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,710
And this is the fun part
of this reaction.

112
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,030
Because it's actually something
we've seen before.

113
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,620
It's a reaction that we've seen
many, many times already.

114
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,660
But it's just not obvious when
you see it in this form.

115
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,160
When you look at this molecule,
right here, what's

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,950
going on here?

117
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,640
Well, I already told you that
I have this highly, highly

118
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,700
strained bond here.

119
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,410
It's like this equilateral
triangle.

120
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,420
The bond angles are closer
than they want to be.

121
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,280
The electrons want to get
away from each other.

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,270
If you try to do this with a
chemistry model, it would

123
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,800
actually strain the plastic or
the wood of the chemistry

124
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,510
model to actually make it.

125
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:13,470
On top of that, this oxygen with
this extra hydrogen now,

126
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,430
it is actually a good
leaving group.

127
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,580
And so now, it's probably
triggering some things in your

128
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,000
brain about the type of reaction
that might occur.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,620
And think about this
carbon right here.

130
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,470
Think about this carbon.

131
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,850
Actually, these two carbons
are the same.

132
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,810
So I'll just pick on this one,
the bottom one, for fun.

133
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,810
Think about this carbon
right here.

134
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,920
It is bonded.

135
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,670
It's a secondary carbon.

136
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,080
So it would not be super great
for an Sn2 reaction.

137
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,530
But you can have an Sn2 reaction
with a secondary

138
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,290
carbon, especially when the
leaving group wants to leave

139
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,410
bad enough.

140
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,860
So if one of these water
molecules, it didn't have to

141
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,820
be this first one right here,
if it just bumps into this

142
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,240
carbon in the exact way, it
can actually act as a

143
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,150
nucleophile.

144
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,890
Water isn't, traditionally,
a very strong nucleophile.

145
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,890
But it can be a nucleophile,
especially if the leaving

146
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,080
group is ready to leave
and this is a

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,780
really strained bond.

148
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,500
So what you could imagine
is that this

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,630
water gives an electron.

150
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,380
It loves this carbon nucleus
right there.

151
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,050
It gives it to that carbon.

152
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,550
And since that carbon is getting
an electron from this

153
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,100
water over here, then it can
release an electron back to

154
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,960
this oxygen, making
it neutral.

155
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,830
So it can release this back
to this oxygen right here.

156
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,930
What will we end up with then?

157
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,250
Now, something interesting
has just happened.

158
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,700
And this is typical of
all Sn2 reactions.

159
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,740
Remember, it's Sn2.

160
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,260
We're substituting with
a nucleophile.

161
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,310
Water is a weak nucleophile.

162
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,690
But, in this case, it'll stick
better than this thing that's

163
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,860
all strained.

164
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,920
And we call it 2, Sn2, because
both of the reactants are

165
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,570
involved in the rate
determining step.

166
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,070
This is the rate determining
step right here.

167
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,060
So what do we end up with?

168
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,065
Let me just draw the hexane
ring, just like that.

169
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,610
   

170
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,500
Now, all of a sudden, this
oxygen up here, what

171
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,540
will it look like?

172
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,030
Well, this bond gets broken.

173
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,220
It takes back an electron.

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,050
So you only have this bond to
the oxygen, this top bond to

175
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,250
the oxygen.

176
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,830
That's the oxygen right there.

177
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,610
It took this electron back.

178
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,130
So now, it has this electron
and the electron that was

179
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,930
bonded to the carbon.

180
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,640
So it has a pair of electrons.

181
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,870
And then, it's bonded to that
hydrogen that it took from the

182
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,130
hydronium in the first step.

183
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,750
And then it's bonded to this
hydrogen over there.

184
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,220
So it really is just an OH group
now, bonded right that.

185
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,650
It's popping out of the page.

186
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,020
You still have this hydrogen
that's going behind the page.

187
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,910
   

188
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,380
But since we had a Sn2 reaction,
you can imagine this

189
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,440
came from the back.

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
And this let go from
the front.

191
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,330
So what will now happen is, this
hydrogen that was kind of

192
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,870
behind the page, now
will pop forward.

193
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,120
Because this guy went from even
behind that hydrogen.

194
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,380
So this hydrogen, over here,
will now pop forward.

195
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,430
So this hydrogen, now,
has popped forward.

196
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,400
I'll circle it just so you see
it's the same hydrogen.

197
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
But it has popped forward,
since this guy, this

198
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,700
nucleophile attack, happened
from the back.

199
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,510
And now, he is attached.

200
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,800
He has attached down here.

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
This water has attached.

202
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,770
Well, it's not water anymore.

203
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,470
So you had the oxygen.

204
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,270
Two hydrogens.

205
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,570
And then it had two pairs.

206
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,350
But now, one of the pair
turns into a bond.

207
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,600
Because it gives this
electron there.

208
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,140
So these two guys are bonded.

209
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,980
This electron is given
to the carbon.

210
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,805
And the bond is behind
the page now.

211
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:45,710
   

212
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,840
Just like that.

213
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,550
And then the final step is--
now, since this guy gave an

214
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,900
electron, he has a positive
charge here.

215
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,680
Just to make it nice and clean,
you can imagine another

216
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,370
water molecule comes and takes
one of those hydrogens away

217
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,090
from this guy.

218
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,340
All these hydrogens are just
getting passed around between

219
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,520
these water molecules.

220
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,450
So you can imagine this
water molecule

221
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,690
could take that hydrogen.

222
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,990
This oxygen takes the
electron back, and

223
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,620
then becomes neutral.

224
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,370
And then our final product--
we are now done--

225
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,950
will look like this.

226
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:24,630
So we had cyclohexene oxide, a
reactive epoxide, in water

227
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,740
with some acid around.

228
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,240
So it kind of catalyzed the
leaving group and all that.

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,810
We just saw that in this.

230
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,150
But what does the resulting
molecule look like?

231
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:38,270
So popping out of the page
up here, we have an OH.

232
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,160
That's this right here.

233
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,770
I'm just simplifying
a little bit.

234
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,340
Going behind the page, we have
a hydrogen right over there.

235
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,770
And then, popping out of the
page we have a hydrogen.

236
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,440
So popping out of
the page, right

237
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,800
here, we have a hydrogen.

238
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,030
And then, behind the page,
we have another OH group.

239
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,760
   

240
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,670
So we've made a diol.

241
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,580
And, in particular, if we wanted
to name this thing

242
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,110
right here, we have our
cyclohexane ring.

243
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,140
That's our main ring.

244
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,390
We have cyclohexane.

245
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,810
   

246
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,290
And then, we have OH
groups on the-- We

247
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,230
can just start numbering.

248
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,080
We want to start numbering
where the groups are.

249
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,460
So we call this the 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 carbon.

250
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,540
We have OH groups at the
1 and the 2 carbons.

251
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,460
So we have two of them.

252
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,080
So it's a diol.

253
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,030
So we call this, 1 comma
2-diol, because

254
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,930
we have two OH groups.

255
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,260
Diol.

256
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,870
The -ol is for alcohol when
you have these OH groups.

257
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,840
We have two of them.

258
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,780
And they are on opposite
sides.

259
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,230
This alcohol, or this OH, is
popping out of the page.

260
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,050
This OH is behind the page.

261
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,050
So if we really wanted to be
specific about even the

262
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,600
stereochemistry here, we
would call this trans.

263
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
They're on opposite sides.

264
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,140
One is in front.

265
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,930
One is behind.

266
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,230
So this is trans.

267
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,500
This is
trans-cyclohexane-1,2-diol.

268
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,790
   

269
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,190
So, hopefully, you
enjoyed that.

270
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,880
What the fun thing about this
is, one, to see that epoxides

271
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,750
are reactive.

272
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,600
You just even see
a new reaction.

273
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,210
But the really fun thing to
see is that these Sn2

274
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,000
reactions keep popping up.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,270
In fact, the ones we learned,
Sn2, Sn1, E1, E2, these just

276
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,340
keep, over and over, popping
up in chemistry in places

277
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,690
that, maybe it wasn't obvious
at the first glance.

278
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,800
But then, when you actually
think about it, it's actually

279
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,030
perfect for that type
of reaction.

280
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,067
