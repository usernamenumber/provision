99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to do the same problem that I did in the last video, but I want to show you there's multiple

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ways to solve these problems that, should hopefully, give you the right answer, if you do them

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the right way. So, once again, 1 pipe can fill a pool 1/2 times

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
faster than a second pipe. If both pipes are open, the pool

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can be filled in 6 hours. If only the slower pipe is open, how

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
long will it take to fill the pool. So, as I said

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the last video whenever you do these problems

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its very important to think in terms of rate,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the rate that the slower pipe can fill a pool

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the rate that the faster pipe can fill a pool.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now right over here I'm going to define

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the slower pipe, the slower pipe, can fill a pool in

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
R, so its rate is R pools per hour, R pools per hour.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if its rate is R pools per hour,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and R for rate, what is the faster pools rate? The faster pools rate
