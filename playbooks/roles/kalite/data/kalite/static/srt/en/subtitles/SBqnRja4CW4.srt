99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are asked to determine the amplitude and the period of y=-1/2 cos 3x.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the fist thing we have to ask ourselves, is what does the amplitude even refer to?

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the amplitude of a periodic function is just half the difference between the minimum and maximum values it takes on.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if I were to draw a periodic function like this, and it would just go back and forth between two (Let me draw a little bit neater).

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It goes back and forth between two values, like that.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So between that value and that value, you take the difference between the two and half of that is the amplitude.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Another way of thinking of the amplitude, is how much does it sway from its middle position?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right over here, we have y=-1/2 cos 3x.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what is going to be the amplitude of this?

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the easy way to think about it it's just, what is the coa... what is multiplying the cosine function?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you could do the same things as if this was a sine function.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have -1/2 multiplying it, so the amplitude. (The amplitude) The amplitude in this situation is going to be the absolute value of negative 1/2.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is equal to 1/2 and you might say, well do I not care about the sign, why do I take the absolute value of it?

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the negative just flips the function around, it's not going to change how much it sways between its minimum and maximum position.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The other thing is, well how it just simply the absolute value of this thing?

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to realize the why, you just have to remember that a cosine function or a sine function varies between positive and negative, if it's just a simple function.
