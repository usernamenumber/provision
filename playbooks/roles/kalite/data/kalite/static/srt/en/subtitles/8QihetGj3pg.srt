1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,870
So I have two 2-dimensional vectors right over here, vector a and vector b.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,821
And what I want to think about is how can we define,

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:15,283
or what would be a reasonable way to define the sum of vector a + vector b.

4
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:19,139
Well one thing that might jump at your mind is, look each of these are 2-dimensional

5
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,003
they both have two components

6
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,272
Why don't we just add the corresponding components?

7
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:28,274
So for the sum, why don't we make the first component of the sum,

8
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:31,023
just the sum of the first two components of these two vectors

9
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:35,021
So why don't we just make it 6 + -4

10
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:38,469
Well 6 + -4 is equal to 2

11
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,935
And why don't we just make the second component,

12
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:43,207
the sum of the two second components

13
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:48,106
So -2 + 4 is also equal to 2

14
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:50,604
So we start with two 2-dimensional vectors

15
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:53,809
you add them together, you get another 2-dimensional vector

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,536
if you think about it in terms of real coordinate spaces

17
00:00:56,536 --> 00:01:01,806
both of these are members of R2, I'll write this down here so we get used to the notation

18
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:12,026
So vector a, and vector b are both members of R2.

19
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:17,437
Which is just another way of saying that these are both two 2-tuples

20
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:20,869
They're both 2-dimensional vectors right over here.

21
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:23,678
Now this might make sense just looking at how we represented it

22
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:27,207
but how does this actually make visual or conceptual sense

23
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,208
and to do that, lets actually plot these vectors

24
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,540
Lets try to represent these vectors in some way, lets try to visualize them

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,938
So vector a we could visualize, this tells us how far this vector moves

26
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,336
in each of these directions, horizontal direction and vertical direction

27
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,789
so if we put the "tail" of the vector at the origin,

28
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,733
and remember, we don't have to put the tail at the origin

29
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,141
but that might make it a little bit easier for us to draw it

30
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,203
we'll go 6 in the horizontal direction, one, two, three, four, five, six

31
00:01:56,203 --> 00:02:00,069
and then -2 in the vertical, so negative 2

32
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:06,363
So vector a could look like this

33
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,778
And once again, the important thing is the magnitude and the direction

34
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:15,872
The magnitude is represented by the length of this vector

35
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:19,003
and the direction is the direction that it's pointed in

36
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:23,272
and also just to emphasize, I could have drawn vector a like that

37
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:30,204
or I could have put it over here, these are all equivalent vectors

38
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:32,872
these are all equal to vector a

39
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:36,859
all I really care about is the magnitude and the direction

40
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:40,066
So with that in mind, let's also draw vector b

41
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:45,942
Vector b, in the horizontal direction goes -4, one, two, three, four

42
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:49,863
and then the vertical direction it goes 4, one, two, three, four

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:59,357
so if it's tail is at the origin, it's head would be at -4, 4

44
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:03,203
So let me draw that, just like that

45
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:07,274
So that right over here is vector b

46
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:12,403
And once again, vector b we could draw it like that or we could draw it

47
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:15,271
let me copy and let me paste it

48
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:20,446
so this would also be another way to draw vector b

49
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:25,537
once again what I really care about is its magnitude and its direction

50
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:29,075
all of these green vectors have the same magnitude, they all have the same length

51
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,403
and they all have the same direction

52
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:35,739
so how does the way that I drew vector a and b jell with what its sum is

53
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,851
So let me draw its sum like this in this blue color

54
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:44,601
So the sum, based on this definition we just used,

55
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:53,336
the vector addition would be 2, 2, so it would look something like this

56
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:57,669
So how does this make sense? That this purple vector

57
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:02,938
plus this green vector is somehow equal to this blue vector

58
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:06,869
and I encourage you to pause the video and think about if that even make sense

59
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:10,530
Well one way to think about it is, this first purple vector,

60
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,336
it shifts us this much, it takes us from this point to that point

61
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,873
and so if we were to add it, lets start at this point

62
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:22,144
and put the green vector's tail right there and see where it ends up putting us

63
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,107
so the green vector, we already have a version

64
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:29,941
so once again we start at the origin, vector a takes us there

65
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:34,335
Now lets start over there with the green vector and see where the green vector takes us

66
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:38,355
And this makes sense, vector a + vector b

67
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:41,268
Put the tail of vector b at the head of vector a

68
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:44,540
so if you were to start at the origin, vector a takes you there

69
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,268
then if you add on what vector b takes you, it takes you right over there

70
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:53,684
so relative to the origin, how much did you , I guess you can say.. shift?

71
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:56,669
And once again, vectors don't only apply to things like displacement

72
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:59,076
it could apply to velocity, it can apply to electrical acceleration

73
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,025
it could apply to a whole series of things

74
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:05,475
but when you visualize it this way, you see that it does make complete sense

75
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:10,206
this blue vector, the sum of the two, is what results when you

76
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:14,940
start with vector a, at that point right over there, vector a takes you there

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,351
then you take vector b's tail, start over there, and it takes you to the tip of the sum.

78
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:25,526
Now one question you might be having is, well vector a + vector b is this,

79
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:30,547
but what is vector b + vector a?

80
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:33,692
Does this still work?

81
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:36,943
Well, based on the definition we had, where you add the corresponding components

82
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:40,446
you're still going to get the same sum vector, so it should come out the same

83
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:43,755
So this would just be -4 + 6 is 2,

84
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:47,873
4 + -2 is 2, but does that make visual sense?

85
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:51,537
So if we start with vector b, so lets say you start right over here

86
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:56,668
vector b takes you right over there, and then if you were to go there

87
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:59,802
and you would start with vector a, so let's do that

88
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:06,400
actually, let me start with a new vector b

89
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,023
So lets say that that is our vector b, right over there

90
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:15,274
and, actually let me give this a place where I'll have some space to work with

91
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,436
So if that's my vector b, right over there

92
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:22,206
and then let me get my copy of vector a,

93
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:25,208
that's a good one, copy

94
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,935
and let me paste it

95
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:31,069
So I could put vector a's tail at the tip of vector b

96
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:35,204
and then it will take me right over there

97
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:42,336
So if I start here, vector b takes me there

98
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:46,399
and now I'm adding to that vector a, which will starting here take me there

99
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,276
and so from my original starting position, I have gone this far

100
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:53,806
Now what is this vector?

101
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:57,800
Well this is exactly the vector 2, 2!

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,941
Or another way of thinking about it, this vector should shift you

103
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:04,141
2 in the horizontal direction, and 2 in the vertical direction.

104
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:06,869
So either way, you are going to get the same result

105
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:11,163
And that should hopefully make visual or conceptual sense as well.
