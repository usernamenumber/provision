1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,100
I'll now introduce you to the
concept of a random variable.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,980
   

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,390
And for me this is something
that I always had a lot of

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,550
trouble getting my head around,
and that's really because

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,040
it's a byproduct of
what it's called.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,470
It's called a variable and
we're used to variables as kind

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,770
of an unknown in the equation.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,830
If I write x plus 3 is equal
to 7, the variable was x.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,680
Maybe you could solve for it
or maybe you could have an

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,550
equation y is equal
to 3x minus 2.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,080
And then, here y and x
are both variables.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,620
If you input 1x you could solve
for the other variable, y.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,290
And you can change them.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,500
And variables were kind of
things that could change and

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,990
that you could solve for.

17
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,540
And they could take on
particular values.

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,160
A random variable is kind of
the same thing in that it can

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,820
take on multiple values, but
it's not something that you

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,570
really ever solve for.

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,910
So just so you get used to the
notation, a random variable

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,180
is usually a capital letter.

23
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,140
Usually a Capital X, Y, or Z.

24
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,940
Usually a capital X.

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,530
And where it really defers from
a traditional variable is that

26
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,850
it can take on a bunch of
different values, like a

27
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,890
traditional variable but
you never solve for it.

28
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,750
And really, it's a little
misleading to call it

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,480
a variable at all.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,110
It's really a function.

31
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,490
And it's a function that maps
you from the world of random

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,740
processes to an actual number.

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,180
So let's say-- I don't
know-- I wanted to somehow

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,560
quantify a random process.

35
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,590
Is it going to rain
or not tomorrow?

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,105
So let's see-- rain tomorrow.

37
00:01:27,105 --> 00:01:31,970
   

38
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,970
No rain.

39
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,340
So you could observe that.

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,850
You could wait until tomorrow
and see if it rains or not, but

41
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,940
then, how do you quantify it?

42
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,140
Well, we can define a random
variable that will quantify it.

43
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,720
We can say this random variable
is going to be equal to 1 if it

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,390
rains tomorrow and it equals 0
if it doesn't rain tomorrow.

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,580
We didn't have to assign 1
and 0; those tend to be a

46
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,500
little bit more useful.

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,460
They make sense.

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,400
But we could have assigned this
as-- I don't know-- we could

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,370
have said that this is 21
and that this is 100.

50
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,680
It's however you define it.

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,570
So it's important to keep this
distinction in mind, that a

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,470
random variable-- it isn't a
variable in the traditional

53
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,520
sense of the world.

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,160
It's more of a function that
maps us from the world of a

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,430
random process to a number.

56
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,760
And then, this number
is going to be random.

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,820
Because we don't know if it's
going to rain or not tomorrow,

58
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,540
maybe we have some sense
of the probabilities.

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,360
So this variable can
take on either value.

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,780
And that leads us-- let me
draw a couple of more random

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,000
variable definitions just so
you get the intuition that

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,490
these really are functions.

63
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,460
So we could define a random
variable x as equal to--

64
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,650
well, actually, let me--

65
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,940
It could just be a very
obvious numeric mapping.

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:55,690
It could just be the
number facing up when

67
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,856
I roll a fair dice.

68
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:00,560
That's a random variable.

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,575
I could've also said just the
number most facing east when I

70
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,890
rolled a fair die, although
that's a little less useful.

71
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,200
You could also define a random
variable, x is equal to-- you

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,730
could say it's equal to 1 if
heads, and I could

73
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,000
say 0 if tails.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,680
Or I could have done it
the other way around.

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,940
Once again, these heads
and tails are outcomes

76
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,810
of an experiment.

77
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,770
When I flip a coin that's a
random process, each flip is an

78
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,090
experiment and then the random
variable is just quantifying

79
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,100
that experiment.

80
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,010
So I know it sounds a little
technical with the terminology,

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,540
but what we're really doing
is fairly something simple.

82
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,380
We're just assigning a
1 if we get a heads, a

83
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,660
0 if we get a tails.

84
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,150
And the random variable is
just that function mapping.

85
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,630
Now I'm going into all of this
random variable business, which

86
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,500
I didn't do before when we did
probability because it does

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,800
start to become a little
bit useful notationally.

88
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,090
Because we'll start to talk
about things like probability

89
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,380
distributions and expected
values, and it really is

90
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,590
useful to quantify things
as a random variable.

91
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,270
And with that said, let's talk
about probability distributions

92
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,130
and expected values.

93
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,560
So the first thing,
probability-- actually, let

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,570
me define something else.

95
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,140
There's two types of
random variables.

96
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,250
You can have discrete random
variables, or continuous.

97
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,030
   

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,560
So there's two types.

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,150
Discrete would be like, really
all of the definitions

100
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,210
that we had up until now.

101
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,200
The flip of a coin, you're
either going to get a 1 or a 0.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,010
There's two discrete cases.

103
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,560
When I roll a die there's
1 of 6 different

104
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,570
outcomes I can have.

105
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,380
Whether it rains
tomorrow, there's 1 of

106
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,080
2 outcomes: yes or no.

107
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,110
So in all of these situations
you could almost say you

108
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,920
could have accountable
number of outcomes.

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,240
A continuous random variable
could take on an infinite

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,100
number of outcomes.

111
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,850
So a continuous random variable
would be the exact-- it could

112
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:11,660
be x is equal to the exact
amount of rain in

113
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,610
inches tomorrow.

114
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,500
Now why is this continuous?

115
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,640
Well, if you think about it
that could take on any of

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,200
an infinite set of values.

117
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,940
You might have 1 inch of
rain tomorrow or you might

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,750
have 1.1 inches of rain.

119
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,620
You might have 1.111
inches of rain.

120
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,560
You might have 2.1111
inches of rain.

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,080
As you could see, you can come
up with an infinite number

122
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,610
of combinations of the
amount of rain you have.

123
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,840
To get exact-- well, I'll go
into more of this when I

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,950
talk about probability
density functions.

125
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,790
But in general, even though you
might say, oh, well, I can't

126
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,280
imagine having an infinite
amount of rain because we're

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,560
not going to have 100
gallons of rain tomorrow.

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,180
But if you think about it, you
could take on any value between

129
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,990
1 and 2 inches of rain.

130
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,170
There's actually an
infinite number of

131
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,900
values between 0 and 1.

132
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,950
For any value you could find
a number that's a little--

133
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,670
just to think about it.

134
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,090
Between 0 and 1, 1/2
is in between those.

135
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,460
And you can always find a
number that's halfway between

136
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,740
those and then a number that's
halfway between those.

137
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,770
There's an infinite number
of numbers between

138
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,640
any two numbers.

139
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,130
While, with the discrete random
variables, it just took on

140
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,050
a finite number of values.

141
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,740
Those ones up here, it
could only take on 1 or 0.

142
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,400
It didn't take on 1.1.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,550
Or it couldn't
take on infinity.

144
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,960
And I make that difference
because actually, how we look

145
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,190
at it in terms of their
probability distributions

146
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,990
are a little different.

147
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,100
But they're very related.

148
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,330
So a discreet random variable
like the ones that we had

149
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,800
defined at the beginning of
these videos, they have a

150
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,980
probability distribution.

151
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,880
Let's do it for-- let's say
x is equal to the number

152
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:59,440
facing up on a fair dice.

153
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
   

154
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,550
So we already know that
to get each outcome--

155
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,360
there's 6 outcomes.

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
You either can get a 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, or 6 facing up.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,430
So let me draw the
probability distribution.

158
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,690
So here are all the outcomes.

159
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,580
I'll draw that on the
horizontal axis.

160
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:30,330
So you get one outcome
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

161
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,850
And then, in the y-axis or in
the vertical, you plot what is

162
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,230
the probability of each of
those outcomes occurring?

163
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,890
   

164
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,295
What's the probability?

165
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,510
I'll switch colors.

166
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,980
So what's the probability
of getting a 1?

167
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, it's 1/6.

168
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,976
So if I draw 1/6 here.

169
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:50,640
   

170
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,330
So the probability is of each
of these occurring-- oh, I

171
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,970
didn't want to do it
like that-- are 1/6.

172
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,425
It's essentially like a
histogram or a bar chart.

173
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:02,570
   

174
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,930
My intention is to draw them
all the exact same height.

175
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,690
   

176
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,840
So this is telling us that
each of these there's a 1/6

177
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,850
chance of it occurring.

178
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,040
If I were to draw a probability
distribution for-- if I were to

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:27,080
find the random variable
x is equal to 1 if

180
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,840
heads, 0 if tails.

181
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,150
This has a very simple
probability distribution.

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,420
   

183
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,140
There's only 2 outcomes.

184
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,730
You're either going
to get a 1 or a 0.

185
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:49,360
And then in the y-axis you'll
have the probabilities.

186
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,550
And each of these, if it's
a fair dice, it's going

187
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,040
to be a 1/2 probability.

188
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,410
And you're going to draw a
little box like that that tells

189
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,160
you each of them are 1/2.

190
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,880
Now let's say that you had
another-- I don't know--

191
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,320
probably distribution function
that looks something like this.

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,390
Those are kind of very run of
the mill examples, but what if

193
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,400
I had something like this?

194
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:10,920
Let's see.

195
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,510
   

196
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,120
Where I had some dice-- let's
say we had some weird

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,910
weightings on it where it had
an outcome of 1-- I had a

198
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,680
1/6 chance like that.

199
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,805
Let's say for some reason
a 2 could never happen.

200
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,950
   

201
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,240
Maybe there is no 2.

202
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,532
Let's say 3 has a 1/6 chance,
a 4 has a 1/6 chance,

203
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,810
a 5 has a 1/6 chance.

204
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,710
And let's say there's two 6's.

205
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,970
Like we erased the 2 and we
put a 6 where the 2 is,

206
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,690
so there's two 6's.

207
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,710
So the 6 has a 2/6 chance.

208
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,810
So the 6 would be a 2/6 chance.

209
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,720
So now I think you can see
where the probability

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,490
distribution function
starts to become a little

211
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,620
bit more interesting.

212
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,040
In the other ones it was kind
of what we would call a

213
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,410
uniform distribution.

214
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,290
All of the outcomes
are equally likely.

215
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,550
That's a uniform distribution.

216
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,010
Once again, this is a
uniform distribution.

217
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,410
This one, all of a sudden, is
not a uniform distribution.

218
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,560
1 is just as likely as 3, 4, 5.

219
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,740
2 is impossible to happen, but
6 is twice as likely to happen

220
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,800
as everything else-- is 2/6.

221
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,610
If someone gives you a
probability density function or

222
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,460
if they give you a little chart
like this, you can immediately

223
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,710
say, what's the probability of
different events occurring?

224
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:44,570
So if you said that x is equal
to the number on unfair dice

225
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,730
that's described by
this probability

226
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,190
distribution function.

227
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,450
Then if I were to ask you the
probability that x is equal to

228
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,370
6, you'd say, oh, the
probability x equals 6

229
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,570
is equal to 2/6 or 1/3.

230
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,660
If I were to say what's the
probability that x, the random

231
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,390
variable x as given by this
definition, is greater than 5,

232
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,350
you would take-- well, let's
say greater than or equal to 5.

233
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,270
Because you want to include
5, and at least, I did.

234
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,290
So it would include this
situation and this situation.

235
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,070
So it'd be 1/6 plus 2/6.

236
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,680
   

237
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,060
And so you could say
that's 3/6 or 1/2.

238
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,450
So it gets pretty interesting
once you don't have a

239
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,130
completely uniform
distribution.

240
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,220
And I'm doing all of this
because in the next couple of

241
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,290
videos-- well, one, we'll move
away from discreet and actually

242
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,990
study continuous probability
distributions, which are called

243
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,680
probability density functions.

244
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,260
And then we'll go to study kind
of a lot of distributions

245
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,560
that show up in nature.

246
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,490
The uniform distribution
is one of them.

247
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,520
There's also the binomial
distribution and the normal

248
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,590
distribution, which is
what some people call the

249
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,070
Gaussian or the bell curve.

250
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,590
Which is kind of a
very common thing.

251
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,500
But anyway, I'm all out
of time and I'll see

252
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,410
you in the next video.

253
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:03,500
