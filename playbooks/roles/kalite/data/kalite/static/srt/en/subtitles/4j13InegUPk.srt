1
00:00:04,927 --> 00:00:10,579
We are looking at William Holman Hunt's Claudio and Isabella from 1850 in Tate Britain.

2
00:00:10,579 --> 00:00:18,725
This is 1850, so it's two years after the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and we're got real pure Pre-Raphaelite style here.

3
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:21,852
Not just style, but in terms of subject matter also, right?

4
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:26,789
How integrated text and image are here is that there's text on the top of the frame

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,410
that has Claudio's line, "Death is a fearful thing," and Isabella's "And shamed life a hateful."

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,878
And then below, in a beautiful kind of medieval script, "Measure for measure."

7
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:40,669
The Shakespeare play that this is from.

8
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:49,617
What's happening is that Claudio has been arrested, a little bit under false charges, for impregnating his mistress.

9
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,943
Well, they are engaged.

10
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:55,345
Right. Claudio's sister, Isabella, is about to become a nun,

11
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:59,964
and the man who's arrested and imprisoned Claudio has said:

12
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:06,395
"You know, well, maybe if your sister agrees to sleep with me, maybe I'll release you from prison."

13
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:11,595
And she refuses to give away her virginity. Remember she's about to enter a nunnery.

14
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:13,685
Right. She's very chaste, she's very devout.

15
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:19,424
This has been interpreted as the moment when Claudio appeals to Isabella to...

16
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:20,466
To save his life.

17
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,852
To save his life - and she refuses.

18
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:25,811
Although there are somewhat differing interpretations about exactly what moment this is.

19
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:28,774
I think there's ambiguity even in his reaction, right?

20
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:32,873
But what's interesting for me is that Hunt has chosen this really high-pitched moral moment,

21
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:34,896
where we don't know which way it's going to go.

22
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:38,539
In a sense we have to ask ourselves how would we act in that moment.

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:44,855
It's that key moment. It's a thing that the Pre-Raphaelites love to do, that totally pregnant moment.

24
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:49,703
I'm looking at that backlight and I see that cherry tree behind them that's in full bloom.

25
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:52,433
And did you notice what's between them?

26
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,656
There's that little spire of a church.

27
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,712
Right - that kind of rose between them.

28
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:04,999
So you can't really blame Claudio for asking his sister to betray her chastity and her vows,

29
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,830
because he's going to die and give his life up for nothing.

30
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,691
And you can't blame her either for not wanting to do what she's asked to do.

31
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,985
Look at the way he's portrayed her.

32
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,431
The look of concern on her face

33
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,544
And sympathy.

34
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,935
It's extraordinary. She's got her hands over his heart.

35
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:24,270
She's comforting him.

36
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,556
There's this tremendous sense of responsibility that she feels.

37
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:35,819
And I'm noticing how close everything is. These two figures, that wall of the prison behind.

38
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,491
Actually, I think Hunt visited a prison in order to paint it directly from life.

39
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:46,688
There's an incredible amount of attention and detail in the rendering even of the insignificant.

40
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,620
I mean, that's what's so extraordinary.

41
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,861
The focus is not simply on the hands, it's not on the face.

42
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:54,936
In fact, one could even argue that the face is somewhat deemphasised.

43
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:58,895
Claudio's face is in shadow as he looks at us, which is a very interesting choice.

44
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,026
He's in front of a brighter window.

45
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:02,998
Yeah, they're back-lit, which is very strange.

46
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:04,770
That's right. It's extremely unusual.

47
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,597
But what that means is that there is a very even light throughout the entire image,

48
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,945
which allows our eye to meander down both of their bodies.

49
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:16,073
Beyond their hands, down his legs to the shackle...

50
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:23,416
And then, as much attention is lavished on the chain, on the boards of the floor, on the brick that is exposed in the window frame.

51
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:26,421
And the moss that seems to be growing on the stone.

52
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:33,147
Look at the vividness of that stone at the back of the room. I mean, you can really see the age and the wear.

53
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:40,019
All of this is this idea that the Pre-Raphaelites have of not using academic formulas and this return to nature.

54
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,426
And it returns to the Renaissance primitives, the "Pre-Raphaelites."

55
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,049
So "before Raphael."

56
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:54,760
And looking at Northern Renaissance painting, looking at the history of art before things became so easy and formulaic,

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,919
and when artists were, in a way, discovering Nature, for the first time again after the Middle Ages.

58
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,945
If we look at the color, it's nothing like we would see in Royal Academy paintings before the Pre-Raphaelites.

59
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:11,668
The purple of his velvet leggings, the red of his velvet and fur-lined tunic, and then,

60
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,234
what I find most extraordinary, the color of the presumably white rose.

61
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:17,972
There's no white in any of that.

62
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:21,387
No, there's blues and greens and yellows and golds.

63
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:28,239
This is a kind of depth and intensity of color that would never have been possible before the Pre-Raphaelites.

64
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:35,199
So what that does for me is that it creates a kind of visual parallel to the intensity of the emotion that's being represented here.

65
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,453
In the sense of the emotion of the lemma that's being presented here.
