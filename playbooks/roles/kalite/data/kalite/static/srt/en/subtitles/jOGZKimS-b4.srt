00:00:00,694 --> 00:00:05,272
Kate: I'm Kate Burns. I'm the educational specialist for the Portland Art Museum.

2
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:10,471
Jillian: Hi I'm Jillian Punska. I am the artist and family program specialist in the education department.

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,795
Kate: And we are standing in front of the Dan Falvin.

4
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:24,660
It is entitled, "Untitled (to Donna) II" and this piece is... was created in 1971 by Flavin,

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,329
like five or so years after he started creating works, mainly of florescent lightbulb fixtures.

6
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:35,712
Jillian: Right so it's made completely of florescent light fixtures.. um..

7
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:45,161
...two verticle pieces that are faced toward the wall, and two horizontal pieces that are faced towards the viewer that are both yellow.

8
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:49,661
And the ones that are facing the wall are blue on the right and red on the left.

9
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:56,462
Well, it is not red actually, it's more of a pink, which makes me wonder... kind of... was he going for primary colors and then he couldn't find a red?

10
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,978
Do you know what colors he had to work with Kate?

11
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:03,828
Kate: I know that the florescent lights he was using were available in about ten different colors.

12
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:13,327
And they were red, blue, green, yellow, pink and some different variations of white. So, some of his work does have red in it.

13
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:20,129
Umm... but I think in this case, maybe he was trying to do something different. I don't know.

14
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:29,159
But I really like how, you know, the pink is on the left hand side of the piece but it casts a pink color field of light on the right hand side of the wall.

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,649
Kate: This piece is...

16
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:31,889
Jillian: It illuminates it

17
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:42,247
Kate: ...yeah. This piece is butted up against a corner of the gallery... and I think he probably, you know, would have put that piece in the same place, if... if he had a choice.

18
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:49,696
Jillian: It is very specific to the corner. Uh... and also if the wall wasn't white it would be a different work of art.

19
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:51,796
Kate: Yeah... that is really interesting too.

20
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:59,664
Jillian: It's interesting how the wall is really flat. It almost looks like it is the main part of the piece.

21
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:07,348
That the... uh... materials that he is working with really frame the wall like a picture frame would frame a painting.

22
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:12,848
Kate: Yea... it does and it kind of flattens the space. I guess it almost obliterates the corner.

23
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:21,696
You know the space plays a large part in this piece and if you're looking straight on, and you're not even looking at the floor, you might not even notice that it is in a corner.

24
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:30,080
And I think that's kind of what he is going for too. He really did want to work with the light, and not the aesthetics of the piece.

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,396
Jillian: It is interesting that Flavin made a corner as beautiful as a painting.

26
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,694
He definitely did.
