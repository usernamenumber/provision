1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,742
The Eastern and Western fronts,

2
00:00:02,742 --> 00:00:04,088
even though they were fronts of the same war,

3
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,300
were very different in character.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,896
A lot of it came out of the fact of who was fighting it

5
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,567
and especially how big the actual fronts were.

6
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:14,816
The Western front, which was generally this region,

7
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:18,404
was a much smaller front than the Eastern front.

8
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:24,733
The Eastern front was essentially this entire region.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,330
And because of that, trench warfare did not become

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,466
a major factor on the Eastern front.

11
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,971
In fact, it was fairly useless on the Eastern front.

12
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,338
If you imagine trying to dig a bunch of trenches --

13
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:40,048
Trenches are a huge advantage for the defending army,

14
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:43,474
as long as you can block off the entire region with trenches.

15
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:46,102
So over here, you can't go around the trenches.

16
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:47,825
If you want to make some ground

17
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,636
an attacking army has to cross the trenches,

18
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,959
and because you now have machine guns

19
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:57,045
the defending soldiers could sit behind their trenches

20
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:02,504
and mow down the attacking army, very easily.

21
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:05,091
And that is what caused the Western front,

22
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,030
especially after the Schlieffen plan was not executed

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,870
as quickly as possible, it turned into a stalemate.

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,234
So, you just had a hugely defensive stalemate.

25
00:01:16,234 --> 00:01:17,897
Because both parties had their trenches,

26
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:21,983
it was hugely advantageous for the defending side.

27
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:25,159
On the Eastern front, you had this huge front,

28
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,231
you couldn't have--

29
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,492
they didn't have enough people

30
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:31,425
to dig trenches across this entire front.

31
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,572
And you can imagine, if you tried to dig a trench,

32
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,308
but you weren't able to cover the entire front,

33
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:40,236
then the attacking army doesn't have to storm your trench,

34
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:43,791
they could just go around your trench.

35
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:48,170
And because trench warfare was not a significant factor,

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,152
not anywhere near as much a factor on the Eastern front,

37
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,292
it was a much more fluid front.

38
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:57,691
You had offensives and counter-offensives between

39
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,179
the Germans and Austrians on one side,

40
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,958
and the Russians on the other.

41
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,358
Now, the other factor,

42
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,262
- and this was mainly with Russia as a variable -

43
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:10,931
the other factor was what was going on in Russia.

44
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,439
Russia had several things going for it:

45
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,759
mainly it had a huge standing army

46
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,825
even before the war

47
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:20,776
and it was able to amass even more.

48
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:23,292
So it had a huge army.

49
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:25,606
But what was going against it --

50
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,510
- and this is why they eventually

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,092
had to get into a very unfavorable treaty

52
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:30,621
with the Central Powers

53
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:32,108
near the end of the war -

54
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,916
is that it had huge internal problems.

55
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,587
I am not just talking about the Military,

56
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,699
I am talking about the entire Empire.

57
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,092
It was arguably due to the

58
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:45,575
economic and the human cost of the war

59
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,825
but as we enter into 1917,

60
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,759
you first have the February Revolution;

61
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,095
Czar Nicolas II has to abdicate the throne

62
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:58,359
because of the riots that are going on

63
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,092
because of the unhappiness,

64
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,851
the unease,

65
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,869
of people going hungry

66
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,098
the morale of the troops going down,

67
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:10,095
And on top of that, Russian military,

68
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:11,860
even though it had a huge army

69
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,439
at the beginning of the war,

70
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,159
the Russian industry was not ready

71
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,959
to fully supply the army

72
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,292
as good as the German army was.

73
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,359
And on top of that,

74
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:21,938
it had communication problems

75
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,625
and in the beginning phases

76
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,281
of the Eastern Front,

77
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:26,492
it even had issues

78
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:28,959
coÃ¶rdinating its actual armies.

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,092
We will cover this in much more depth

80
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:32,625
in a future video.

81
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,025
But what we will see is:

82
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:36,102
Western Front, Schlieffen plan not executed

83
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,541
as fast as possible,

84
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,935
ends up in a stalemate --

85
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,096
This did allow the Germans

86
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,117
to bring some of their troops

87
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,510
back to the Eastern front

88
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,182
to fight the Russians.

89
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,436
This goes back and forth

90
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,597
as we will see,

91
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,425
but once you enter into 1917,

92
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,870
you have a revolution in Russia:

93
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,099
first the February Revolution

94
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,025
- Czar Nicolas has to abdicate -

95
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,603
and then later that year,

96
00:03:57,603 --> 00:04:00,625
the Bolsheviks overthrow the interim governement.

97
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,526
You now have Communist Russia

98
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:05,173
and the Bolshevik military are in no mood

99
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,959
to continue to fight the Germans

100
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,959
and Austria-Hungary.

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,857
And so they get into a treaty with them

102
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:17,692
and take themselves out of the war.

103
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,424
We'll cover that in more detail

104
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:20,777
in a future video.
