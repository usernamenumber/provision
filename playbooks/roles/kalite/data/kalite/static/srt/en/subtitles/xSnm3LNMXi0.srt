1
00:00:04,646 --> 00:00:06,968
We are looking at Caspar David Friedrich,

2
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:08,920
German romantic artist.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,426
It is a painting called “A walk at dusk”

4
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:15,652
and dates to somewhere between 1830 and 1835.

5
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,650
And it is supposed to be late Friedrich.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,617
-Yes, it’s really late one. - And it’s small.

7
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,154
It's only maybe 16 inches...

8
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:24,245
Right 18 inches, something like that.

9
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:25,607
It's small.

10
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:28,423
And it’s so recognizably Friedrich, you know,

11
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:33,644
it’s got this alone figure, a kind of twilight or dusk.

12
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:35,223
Deep dusk.

13
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,594
And of course it’s got a kind of neolithic tomb or

14
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:42,216
megalithic, or something that’s got a large stone

15
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,398
in a kind of coffin shape.

16
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:48,548
A small figure of a man standing nearby,

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,359
looking at the tomb.

18
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,337
Obviously contemplating mortality

19
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:56,798
and the meaning of life

20
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,491
and whether there is life after death.

21
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,996
The way is that we could transcend the human lifetime in a number of different ways, right?

22
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,470
Because you’ve got this figure himself

23
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:08,610
contemplating perhaps his own death.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,857
I think the museum is suggesting

25
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:11,246
that this might be Friedrich.

26
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:13,052
But then you’ve got this,

27
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,493
he’s contemplating death

28
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:17,350
in front of ancient tomb.

29
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,900
The tomb is probably 4000 years old and you know,

30
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,755
what is death mean in that kind of historic timeframe.

31
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:26,984
And then you’ve got nature itself.

32
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:30,560
In a kind of wintery landscape, I think, right?

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,810
- With the bare trees - Yeah trees are …leaves…

34
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,191
At least in the foreground.

35
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,950
So you’ve got this notion of a kind of

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,805
renewal in nature,

37
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:41,059
and then you’ve got the sky.

38
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,233
And actually the whole thing is quite beautiful.

39
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:46,633
Greish, green...

40
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:52,027
You really indulge in a sort of somber, quite, contemplative state.

41
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,599
But you can think of it as

42
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,930
a kind of modern, religious painting?

43
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:59,230
- Absolutely. - Of a contemplation of the meaning,

44
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,797
- By the way, I think we’re suppose to identify with that figure - I think we step light into...

45
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:09,196
- Either at that moment, in nature, alone, very quiet, at dusk... - And in a way ...

46
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,930
…and end of life, in the way of metaphor.

47
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,922
So do you think that that’s the way Friedrich wanted his paintings just to be approached?

48
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:18,597
-Quietly, perhaps individually? -I think so, yeah.

49
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,625
I’m not sure that the museum setting

50
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,367
is exactly right for it.

51
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:25,064
With that sort of noise of people in the public.

52
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:28,620
-Some these paintings are actually quite alter like. -That's true.

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,997
So the contemplative and spiritual.

54
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:34,506
And I think it’s often the quality of that and we certainly see that here.

55
00:02:34,506 --> 00:02:37,796
And then we’ve got the sort of offside and it’s really interesting kind of composition

56
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:41,796
because you’ve got the small man placed in the diminished scale

57
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,698
in nature, especially against the mass of that rock.

58
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:48,796
- You’ve got this trees grow up. - Up from the rock almost. -That's right.

59
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:53,011
And then of course you’ve got an image of the moon and a couple of stars or

60
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,609
planets that may be just becoming visible

61
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,100
as the night darkens.

62
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,206
It’s really, it’s quiet, it’s beautiful,

63
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,205
and it’s this moment in history when

64
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,297
this tremendous, romantic moment

65
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:09,773
when I think artists are looking for new ways of representing the spiritual.

66
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,531
Right, and what by romantic we don’t mean like

67
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,881
the normal usage of our way of using romantic.

68
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,734
No, no, no. Not in terms of love.

69
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,793
But in something more emotional,

70
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:21,672
something more expressive.

71
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:25,088
The really privilegous human emotions,

72
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:27,058
I think that’s exactly right.
