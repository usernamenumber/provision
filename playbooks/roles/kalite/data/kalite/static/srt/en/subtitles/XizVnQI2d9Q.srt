1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,410
We're on problem 19.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,210
If k, n, x,and y are positive numbers satisfying--

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,710
let's see, what did they write?

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:20,820
They wrote x to the minus 4/3 is equal to k to the minus 2.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,990
y to the positive 4/3 is equal to n squared.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:42,100
What is xy to the minus 2/3 in terms of n and k?

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,090
All right, so we just have to rewrite this in terms of n

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,220
and k, so let me write it big.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:59,260
So xy to the minus 2/3, that equals x to the minus 2/3,

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,300
times y to the minus 2/3.

11
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,590
We know what x to the 4/3 is.

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,680
This is what I wrote here, it might not be that legible.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,090
Sorry. So this is a 4, right?

14
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,290
We know what x to the minus 4/3 is.

15
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,460
So can we rewrite this as x to the minus 4/3 to something?

16
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,800
Well, sure.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,840
We can rewrite this term, right here, we can write this as

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,890
let me write it right below it so you don't get too confused

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,930
as x to the minus 4/3, and then you raise that

20
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,070
to the 1/2 power.

21
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,210
This is the same thing as this.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,350
How do I know that?

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,250
Well, if I multiply 4/3 times 1/2-- because I'm raising

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,390
something to an exponent, and then that to an exponent--

25
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,270
if I multiply minus 4/3 times 1/2,I get minus 2/3, right?

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,710
This 2 cancels out, this becomes a 2, and this is what I get.

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,230
You can try it out.

28
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,740
Similarly, I want to write this second term--

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,310
I'm going to do it in green-- this y to the minus 2/3.

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,770
I know what y to the 4/3 is, right?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,560
So I want to write it as y to the 4/3 to some other power.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,130
So 4/3 times what is equal to minus 2/3?

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,580
Well, 4/3 times minus 1/2.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,030
And you can try it out.

35
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,390
4/3 times minus 1/2 is equal to minus 2/3, right?

36
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,780
A positive times a negative equals a negative.

37
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,010
And then the 4 and the 2 end up just the

38
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,540
2-- sorry, I'm burping.

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,690
So what does this become?

40
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,320
Well, we know what x to the minus 4/3 is, right?

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,440
x to the minus 4/3 is equal to k to the minus 2.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,050
So that first term is equal to this, is equal to k-- that's

43
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,780
too dark-- k to the minus 2, and then we're raising that to

44
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,070
the 1/2-- right, that's the same 1/2 right there--

45
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,180
and then y to the 4/3.

46
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,120
What's y to the 4/3?

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Well, that's n squared.

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,610
And then that's, of course,the minus 1/2.

49
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,630
And then we can multiply.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,950
What's minus 2 times 1/2?

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,880
Well, it's just minus 1.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
So it's k to the minus 1.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,210
And then what's 2 times minus 1/2?

54
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,680
It's minus 1 again.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,590
So k to the minus 1,n to the minus 1.

56
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,350
And that's the same thing as 1/kn, or 1/nk,

57
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,520
which is choice A.

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,260
And I just realized that there's actually an easier way

59
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,740
to do that.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,830
We could've done it like this, we could have just said--

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,470
let me see, let me erase this stuff, because it's, I think,

62
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,880
good for you to know the easier way, instead of the way

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,900
I just showed you how to do it.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,280
Let me erase all of this.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,430
I think we would've saved some steps,

66
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,910
and been more intuitive.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,120
Let me erase all of this, I just wanted to keep

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
what I had written before.

69
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,660
Erase, erase, erase.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,260
OK, I think that's good enough.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,170
You can just ignore the stuff on the right.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,030
So we could've simplified these ahead of time.

73
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,770
We could have said, x to the minus 4/3 is equal to k

74
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,160
to the minus 2.

75
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,340
If we raised both of these to the 1/2 power,

76
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,660
we would get what?

77
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,570
Minus 4/3 times 1/2 is-- we would have gotten x to the minus

78
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,850
2/3 is equal to-- what's negative 2 times 1/2?

79
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,950
It's negative 1, right?

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,950
It would've equaled k to the negative 1.

81
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:56,860
And similarly, if we had raised y to the 4/3 equals n squared

82
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,260
if we'd raised both of those to the minus 1/2--

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,000
if you do something on one side of the equation, you just have

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,460
to do it on the other-- then you would have gotten

85
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,820
y to the minus 2/3 is equal to n to the minus 1.

86
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,240
And then this would have been really easy to solve.

87
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,120
xy to the minus 2/3 is the same thing as x to the minus 2/3,

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,850
times y to the minus 2/3.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
x to the the minus 2/3 is k to the minus 1.

90
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,500
And y to the negative 2/3 is n to the minus 1.

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,090
So it would have been k to the minus 1, n to the minus 1.

92
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,940
That's 1/nk.

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,770
Well, I guess in hindsight I can say this was easier, but

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,510
the way we did it would've also worked, and you really

95
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,430
don't know sometimes which one will be the shortcut when you

96
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,080
do it the first time.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,470
But either way could've worked.

98
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,820
You could've simplified ahead of time, if you had seen that

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,800
you wanted to get it into 2/3, not 4/3,

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,130
because they had a 2/3 here.

101
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,030
Or you could just go the way we did it the first time,

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,220
either way works.

103
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,590
Next problem, problem number 20.

104
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,270
OK, functions of f and g.

105
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,820
So I'm going to have to do some drawing here,

106
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,630
if we have enough time.

107
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,830
So I have to draw two of them.

108
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,160
That one's going to be for f,and this one's going to be for g

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,110
What points are there?

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,050
So f of x-- let's see, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,030
f of x is 2 points back, and it intersects there.

112
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,320
And it intersects at the point minus 1 comma 1, 2, 3,

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,280
so it intersects here.

114
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,930
And then it goes through the origin.

115
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,520
And then it goes to 1, minus 3.

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,710
So that's 1, 2, 3, 1, so it goes here.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,200
And then it goes at 2 comma 0, and it intersects here.

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,170
So let me try to draw that.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,770
So the graph looks something like this.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,790
It goes up, it intersects this point, comes down

121
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,040
through the origin, goes down here,and then goes up like that

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,060
That is y equals f of x.

123
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,080
Now what does g of x do?

124
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,600
g of x goes to 2 comma 1.

125
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,790
So 1, 2 comma 1.

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,450
Then it's to 4, minus 5.

127
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,070
So 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3,4, 5-- 4, minus 5.

128
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,920
And then it goes back up.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,460
So it looks something like this.

130
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,260
It goes down, goes up like that, goes back up like that.

131
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,560
The figures above show the graph of the functions f and g.

132
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,850
The function f is defined by-- so this one-- f of x

133
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,780
is equal to x to the third minus 4x.

134
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:09,190
The function g of x is equal to f of x plus h, plus k,

135
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,640
where h and k are constants.

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,590
What is the value of k?

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,390
So essentially, what they're saying is, g of x is f of x

138
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,340
shifted up or down by some value, k, right?

139
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,200
Because when you add a constant to a function,

140
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,890
you're just moving it up or down by some value, k.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,410
And when you add h, that means you're shifting it to--

142
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,130
let me make sure I get this right-- so if it was x minus h,

143
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,790
that means you're shifting it to the right by h.

144
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:46,990
So x plus h means you're shifting it to the left by h.

145
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,060
This point corresponds to this point.

146
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,500
So how much did we shift down?

147
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,820
This is the point negative 1 comma 3.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,130
And this is the point 2 comma 1.

149
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,880
So we went from y equals 3 to y equals 1, right?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,190
So we shifted down by 2.

151
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,780
So k is going to be minus 2.

152
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,270
And similarly you could do it with this point.

153
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,680
So k is equal to minus 2.

154
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,190
Now we have to figure out how much we shifted left to right.

155
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,900
So [? similarly, ?]

156
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,330
these are the corresponding points,

157
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,500
because you can look at them in the graph.

158
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,620
So we went from minus 1 to positive 2.

159
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,590
So we shifted to the right by 3.

160
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,800
And you could do the same thing with this point here

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,410
at the bottom.

162
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,080
We shifted to the right by 3.

163
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,880
So if I wanted to shift f of x to the right by 3,

164
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,220
I would write it like this,f of x minus 3.

165
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,490
That's how I would shift a function to the right by 3.

166
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,060
They're saying plus h, so h has to be minus 3.

167
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,160
h is minus 3.

168
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,850
And minus 3 times minus 2?

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,640
Well, that's positive 6,which is choice E.
