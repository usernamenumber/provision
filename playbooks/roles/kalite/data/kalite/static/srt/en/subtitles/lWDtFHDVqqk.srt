1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,250
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,990
To just review what I was doing
on the last video before

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,050
I ran out of time, I said that
conservation of energy tells

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,980
us that the work I've put into
the system or the energy that

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,300
I've put into the system--
because they're really the

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,740
same thing-- is equal to the
work that I get out of the

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,440
system, or the energy that
I get out of the system.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,480
That means that the input work
is equal to the output work,

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,540
or that the input force times
the input distance is equal to

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,610
the output force times the
output distance-- that's just

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,020
the definition of work.

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,040
Let me just rewrite this
equation here.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,730
If I could just rewrite this
exact equation, I could say--

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:42,780
the input force, and let me just
divide it by this area.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,900
The input here-- I'm pressing
down this piston that's

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,580
pressing down on this
area of water.

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:54,560
So this input force-- times
the input area.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,380
Let's call the input 1, and
call the output 2 for

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,630
simplicity.

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,069
Let's say I have a piston
on the top here.

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:09,320
Let me do this in a good color--
brown is good color.

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,060
I have another piston here, and
there's going to be some

23
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,140
outward force F2.

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,500
The general notion is that I'm
pushing on this water, the

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,740
water can't be compressed, so
the water's going to push up

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,470
on this end.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,880
The input force times the input
distance is going to be

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,540
equal to the output force times
the output distance

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,560
right-- this is just the law of
conservation of energy and

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,590
everything we did with
work, et cetera.

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,060
I'm rewriting this equation, so
if I take the input force

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,610
and divide by the input area--
let me switch back to green--

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,660
then I multiply by the
area, and then I just

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,222
multiply times D1.

35
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,730
You see what I did here-- I just
multiplied and divided by

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,710
A1, which you can do.

37
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,230
You can multiply and divide by
any number, and these two

38
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,260
cancel out.

39
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,160
It's equal to the same thing
on the other side, which is

40
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,420
F2-- I'm not good at managing
my space on my whiteboard--

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,790
over A2 times A2 times D2.

42
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,270
Hopefully that makes sense.

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,890
What's this quantity right here,
this F1 divided by A1?

44
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,640
Force divided by area, if you
haven't been familiar with it

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,780
already, and if you're just
watching my videos there's no

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,450
reason for you to be, is
defined as pressure.

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,260
Pressure is force in a given
area, so this is pressure--

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,620
we'll call this the
pressure that I'm

49
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,165
inputting into the system.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,360
What's area 1 times
distance 1?

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,950
That's the area of the tube
at this point, the

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,840
cross-sectional area,
times this distance.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,750
That's equal to this volume
that I calculated in the

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,520
previous video-- we could
say that's the

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,410
input volume, or V1.

56
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,420
Pressure times V1 is equal to
the output pressure-- force 2

57
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,115
divided by area 2 is the output
pressure that the water

58
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,670
is exerting on this piston.

59
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,560
So that's the output
pressure, P2.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,700
And what's area 2 times D2?

61
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,110
The cross sectional area, times
the height at which how

62
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,490
much the water's being displaced
upward, that is

63
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,740
equal to volume 2.

64
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,680
But what do we know about
these two volumes?

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,420
I went over it probably
redundantly in the previous

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,690
video-- those two volumes are
equal, V1 is equal to V2, so

67
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,170
we could just divide both
sides by that equation.

68
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,040
You get the pressure input is
equal to the pressure output,

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,380
so P1 is equal to P2.

70
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,410
I did all of that just to show
you that this isn't a new

71
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,190
concept: this is just the
conservation of energy.

72
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,120
The only new thing I did is I
divided-- we have this notion

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,200
of the cross-sectional area,
and we have this notion of

74
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,190
pressure-- so where
does that help us?

75
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,320
This actually tells us-- and
you can do this example in

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,660
multiple situations, but I like
to think of if we didn't

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,170
have gravity first, because
gravity tends to confuse

78
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,070
things, but we'll introduce
gravity in a video or two-- is

79
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,490
that when you have any external
pressure onto a

80
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,490
liquid, onto an incompressible
fluid, that pressure is

81
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,960
distributed evenly throughout
the fluid.

82
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,770
That's what we essentially just
proved just using the law

83
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,030
of conservation of energy, and
everything we know about work.

84
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,370
What I just said is called
Pascal's principle: if any

85
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,390
external pressure is applied to
a fluid, that pressure is

86
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,660
distributed throughout
the fluid equally.

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,640
Another way to think about it--
we proved it with this

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,710
little drawing here-- is, let's
say that I have a tube,

89
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,520
and at the end of the
tube is a balloon.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
Let's say I'm doing this
on the Space Shuttle.

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,320
It's saying that if I increase--
say I have some

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,570
piston here.

93
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,560
This is stable, and
I have water

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,810
throughout this whole thing.

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,950
Let me see if I can use that
field function again-- oh no,

96
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,760
there must have been a
hole in my drawing.

97
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Let me just draw the water.

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,970
I have water throughout this
whole thing, and all Pascal's

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,410
principle is telling us that
if I were to apply some

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:51,360
pressure here, that that net
pressure, that extra pressure

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm applying, is going to
compress this little bit.

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,770
That extra compression is
going to be distributed

103
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,130
through the whole balloon.

104
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,330
Let's say that this right here
is rigid-- it's some kind of

105
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,450
metal structure.

106
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,150
The rest of the balloon is going
to expand uniformly, so

107
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,830
that increased pressure I'm
doing is going through the

108
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,100
whole thing.

109
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,980
It's not like the balloon will
get longer, or that the

110
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,010
pressure is just translated
down here, or that just up

111
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,615
here the balloon's going to get
wider and it's just going

112
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,170
to stay the same length there.

113
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,800
Hopefully, that gives you a
little bit of intuition.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,050
Going back to what I had drawn
before, that's actually

115
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,430
interesting, because that's
actually another simple or

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,220
maybe not so simple machine
that we've constructed.

117
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,190
I almost defined it as a
simple machine when I

118
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,100
initially drew it.

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,520
Let's draw that weird thing
again, where it looks like

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,440
this, where I have
water in it.

121
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,678
Let's make sure I fill it, so
that when I do the fill, it

122
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,720
will completely fill, and
doesn't fill other things.

123
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,820
This is cool, because this is
now another simple machine.

124
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:15,320
We know that the pressure in is
equal to the pressure out.

125
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,990
And pressure is force divided
by area, so the force in,

126
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:32,080
divided by the area in, is equal
to the force out divided

127
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,200
by the area out.

128
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,200
Let me give you an example:
let's say that I were to apply

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:49,450
with a pressure in equal
to 10 pascals.

130
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,590
That's a new word, and it's
named after Pascal's

131
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,090
principle, for Blaise Pascal.

132
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,070
What is a pascal?

133
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,310
That is just equal to 10 newtons
per meter squared.

134
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,460
That's all a pascal is-- it's
a newton per meter squared,

135
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,770
it's a very natural unit.

136
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,930
Let's say my pressure in is 10
pascals, and let's say that my

137
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,930
input area is 2 square meters.

138
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,560
If I looked the surface of the
water there it would be 2

139
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:31,500
square meters, and let's say
that my output area is equal

140
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,640
to 4 meters squared.

141
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,550
What I'm saying is that I can
push on a piston here, and

142
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,470
that the water's going to push
up with some piston here.

143
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,220
First of all, I told you what my
input pressure is-- what's

144
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,840
my input force?

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,900
Input pressure is equal to input
force divided by input

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,260
area, so 10 pascals is equal to
my input force divided by

147
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,470
my area, so I multiply
both sides by 2.

148
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,640
I get input force is equal
to 20 newtons.

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,650
My question to you is what
is the output force?

150
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,810
How much force is the
system going to push

151
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,180
upwards at this end?

152
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,880
We know that must if my input
pressure was 10 pascals, my

153
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,270
output pressure would
also be 10 pascals.

154
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,390
So I also have 10 pascals is
equal to my out force over my

155
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,760
out cross-sectional area.

156
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
So I'll have a piston here,
and it goes up like that.

157
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,710
That's 4 meters, so I do 4
times 10, and so I get 40

158
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,450
newtons is equal to
my output force.

159
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,740
So what just happened here?

160
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,920
I inputted-- so my input force
is equal to 20 newtons, and my

161
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,550
output force is equal to 40
newtons, so I just doubled my

162
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,840
force, or essentially I had a
mechanical advantage of 2.

163
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,530
This is an example of a
simple machine, and

164
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,040
it's a hydraulic machine.

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,310
Anyway, I've just
run out of time.

166
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,560
I'll see you in the next video.
