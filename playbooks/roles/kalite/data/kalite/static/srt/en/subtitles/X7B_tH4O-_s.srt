1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
   

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,680
In this video, I want to focus
on a few more techniques for

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,210
factoring polynomials.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,130
And in particular, I want to
focus on quadratics that don't

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,310
have a 1 as the leading
coefficient.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,540
For example, if I wanted
to factor 4x squared

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,920
plus 25x minus 21.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,440
Everything we've factored so
far, or all of the quadratics

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,100
we've factored so far, had
either a 1 or negative 1 where

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,090
this 4 is sitting.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,880
All of a sudden now, we
have this 4 here.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,840
So what I'm going to teach you
is a technique called,

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,020
factoring by grouping.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,130
And it's a little bit more
involved than what we've

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,100
learned before, but
it's a neat trick.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,210
To some degree, it'll become
obsolete once you learn the

17
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,600
quadratic formula, because,
frankly, the quadratic formula

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,230
is a lot easier.

19
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,550
But this is how it goes.

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,770
I'll show you the technique.

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,910
And then at the end of this
video, I'll actually show you

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,300
why it works.

23
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,430
So what we need to do here,
is we need to think of two

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,120
numbers, a and b, where a
times b is equal 4 times

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,700
negative 21.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:12,530
So a times b is going to be
equal to 4 times negative 21,

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,280
which is equal to negative 84.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,490
And those same two numbers,
a plus b, need

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,480
to be equal to 25.

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,930
Let me be very clear.

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,300
This is the 25, so they need
to be equal to 25.

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,970
This is where the 4 is.

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,540
So we go, 4 times negative 21.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,270
That's a negative 21.

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,680
So what two numbers are there
that would do this?

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,050
Well, we have to look at the
factors of negative 84.

37
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,710
And once again, one
of these are going

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
to have to be positive.

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,870
The other ones are going to have
to be negative, because

40
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,170
their product is negative.

41
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,350
So let's think about
the different

42
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,420
factors that might work.

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,465
4 and negative 21 look
tantalizing, but when you add

44
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:01,970
them, you get negative 17.

45
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,870
Or, if you had negative 4 and
21, you'd get positive 17.

46
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,010
Doesn't work.

47
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,220
Let's try some other
combinations.

48
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,150
1 and 84, too far apart when
you take their difference.

49
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,420
Because that's essentially what
you're going to do, if

50
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,500
one is negative and
one is positive.

51
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,840
Too far apart.

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,730
Let's see you could do 3--
I'm jumping the gun.

53
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,370
2 and 42.

54
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,620
Once again, too far apart.

55
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,800
Negative 2 plus 42 is 40.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,650
2 plus negative 42 is negative
40-- too far apart.

57
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:41,020
3 and-- Let's see, 3 goes into
84-- 3 goes into 8 2 times.

58
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,860
2 times 3 is 6.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,200
8 minus 6 is 2.

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,610
Bring down the 4.

61
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,150
Goes exactly 8 times.

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,120
So 3 and 28.

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,370
This seems interesting.

64
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,630
   

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,920
And remember, one of these
has to be negative.

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,240
So if we have negative 3 plus
28, that is equal to 25.

67
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,220
Now, we've found our
two numbers.

68
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,200
But it's not going to be quite
as simple of an operation as

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,510
what we did when this was
a 1 or negative 1.

70
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,330
What we're going to do now is
split up this term right here.

71
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:29,160
   

72
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,800
We're going to split it up into
positive 28x minus 3x.

73
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,590
We're just going to
split that term.

74
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,890
That term is that term
right there.

75
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,150
And of course, you have your
minus 21 there, and you have

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,350
your 4x squared over here.

77
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,100
Now, you might say, how did you
pick the 28 to go here,

78
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,570
and the negative
3 to go there?

79
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,000
And it actually does matter.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,730
The way I thought about it is
3 or negative 3, and 21 or

81
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,590
negative 21 , they have
some common factors.

82
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,460
In particular, they have
the factor 3 in common.

83
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,780
And 28 and 4 have some
common factors.

84
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,940
So I grouped the 28 on
the side of the 4.

85
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,730
And you're going to see what
I mean in a second.

86
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:15,450
If we, literally, group these
so that term becomes 4x

87
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,140
squared plus 28x.

88
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:25,880
And then, this side, over
here in pink, it's plus

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,740
negative 3x minus 21.

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,810
Once again, I picked these.

91
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,300
I grouped the negative 3 with
the 21, or the negative 21,

92
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,320
because they're both
divisible by 3.

93
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,790
And I grouped the 28 with the
4, because they're both

94
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,250
divisible by 4.

95
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,800
And now, in each of these
groups, we factor as

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,550
much out as we can.

97
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,050
So both of these terms
are divisible by 4x.

98
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,740
So this orange term is equal
to 4x times x-- 4x squared

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:03,020
divided by 4x is just x-- plus
28x divided by 4x is just 7.

100
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
Now, this second term.

101
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,630
Remember, you factor
out everything that

102
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,030
you can factor out.

103
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,160
Well, both of these terms are
divisible by 3 or negative 3.

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,945
So let's factor out
a negative 3.

105
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:16,260
And this becomes x plus 7.

106
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,690
And now, something might
pop out at you.

107
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,350
We have x plus 7 times
4x plus, x plus 7

108
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,150
times negative 3.

109
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,630
So we can factor out
an x plus 7.

110
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,550
This might not be completely
obvious.

111
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,900
You're probably not
used to factoring

112
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,490
out an entire binomial.

113
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,350
But you could view this
could be like a.

114
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,790
Or if you have 4xa minus 3a,
you would be able to

115
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,930
factor out an a.

116
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,330
And I can just leave this
as a minus sign.

117
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,150
   

118
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,950
Let me delete this
plus right here.

119
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,850
Because it's just
minus 3, right?

120
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,970
Plus negative 3, same
thing as minus 3.

121
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,640
So what can we do here?

122
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,270
We have an x plus 7, times 4x.

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,040
We have an x plus 7,
times negative 3.

124
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,110
Let's factor out the x plus 7.

125
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:16,350
We get x plus 7, times
4x minus 3.

126
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,790
Minus that 3 right there.

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,110
And we've factored
our binomial.

128
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,550
Sorry, we've factored our
quadratic by grouping.

129
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,210
And we factored it into
two binomials.

130
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,140
Let's do another example of
that, because it's a little

131
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,770
bit involved.

132
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,290
But once you get the hang
of it's kind of fun.

133
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:43,540
So let's say we want to factor
6x squared plus 7x plus 1.

134
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,800
Same drill.

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,940
We want to find a times b that
is equal to 1 times 6, which

136
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,110
is equal to 6.

137
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,460
And we want to find an a plus
b needs to be equal to 7.

138
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,520
This is a little bit more
straightforward.

139
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,900
What are the-- well, the obvious
one is 1 and 6, right?

140
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,310
1 times 6 is 6.

141
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,620
1 plus 6 is 7.

142
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,150
So we have a is equal to 1.

143
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,700
Or let me not even
assign them.

144
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,650
The numbers here are 1 and 6.

145
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,740
Now, we want to split this
into a 1x and a 6x.

146
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,420
But we want to group it so it's
on the side of something

147
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,090
that it shares a factor with.

148
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,880
So we're going to have a 6x
squared here, plus-- and so

149
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm going to put the
6x first because 6

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,170
and 6 share a factor.

151
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,580
And then, we're going to
have plus 1x, right?

152
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,650
6x plus 1x equals 7x.

153
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,830
That was the whole point.

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,580
They had to add up to 7.

155
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,000
And then we have the
final plus 1 there.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,320
Now, in each of these groups,
we can factor out

157
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,220
as much as we like.

158
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,080
So in this first group,
let's factor out a 6x.

159
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,020
So this first group becomes 6x
times-- 6x squared divided by

160
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,480
6x is just an x.

161
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,380
6x divided by 6x is just a 1.

162
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,730
And then, the second
group-- we're going

163
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,130
to have a plus here.

164
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,870
But this second group, we just
literally have a x plus 1.

165
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,500
Or we could even write a
1 times an x plus 1.

166
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,440
You could imagine I just
factored out of 1 so to speak.

167
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,790
Now, I have 6x times x plus
1, plus 1 times x plus 1.

168
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,740
Well, I can factor
out the x plus 1.

169
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:35,549
If I factor out an x plus 1,
that's equal to x plus 1 times

170
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,690
6x plus that 1.

171
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm just doing the

172
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,460
distributive property in reverse.

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,230
So hopefully you didn't
find that too bad.

174
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,430
And now, I'm going to actually
explain why this little

175
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,170
magical system actually works.

176
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,280
   

177
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,530
Let me take an example.

178
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,530
I'll do it in very
general terms.

179
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:03,630
Let's say I had ax plus b,
times cx-- actually, I'm

180
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,300
afraid to use the a's and b's.

181
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,760
I think that'll confuse
you, because I

182
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,930
use a's and b's here.

183
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,240
They won't be the same thing.

184
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,760
So let me use completely
different letters.

185
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's say I have fx plus g,
times hx plus, I'll use j

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
instead of i.

187
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,450
You'll learn in the future
why don't like

188
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,710
using i as a variable.

189
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,000
So what is this going
to be equal to?

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,920
Well, it's going to be fx
times hx which is fhx.

191
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,710
And then, fx times j.

192
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,800
So plus fjx.

193
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,240
And then, we're going
to have g times hx.

194
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,010
So plus ghx.

195
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,990
And then g times j.

196
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,840
Plus gj.

197
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:02,500
Or, if we add these two middle
terms, you have fh times x,

198
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,970
plus-- add these two terms--
fj plus gh x.

199
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,170
Plus gj.

200
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,540
Now, what did I do here?

201
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,550
Well, remember, in all of these
problems where you have

202
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,650
a non-1 or non-negative 1
coefficient here, we look for

203
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,560
two numbers that add up to this,
whose product is equal

204
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,480
to the product of
that times that.

205
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,780
Well, here we have two numbers
that add up-- let's say that a

206
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,030
is equal to fj.

207
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,970
   

208
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,750
That is a.

209
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,930
And b is equal to gh.

210
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,730
So a plus b is going to be
equal to that middle

211
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,980
coefficient.

212
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,370
   

213
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,100
And then what is a times b? a
times b is going to be equal

214
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,260
to fj times gh.

215
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,140
   

216
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,320
We could just reorder these
terms. We're just multiplying

217
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,430
a bunch of terms. So that could
be rewritten as f times

218
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,390
h times g times j.

219
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,090
These are all the same things.

220
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,620
Well, what is fh times gj?

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,150
This is equal to fh times gj.

222
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,530
Well, this is equal to the first
coefficient times the

223
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,670
constant term.

224
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,870
So a plus b will be equal to
the middle coefficient.

225
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,930
And a times b will equal the
first coefficient times the

226
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,670
constant term.

227
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,330
So that's why this whole
factoring by grouping even

228
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,180
works, or how we're able
to figure out what

229
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,200
a and b even are.

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,210
Now, I'm going to close up
with something slightly

231
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,800
different, but just to make
sure that you have a

232
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,130
well-rounded education
in factoring things.

233
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,050
What I want to do is to teach
you to factor things a little

234
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,940
bit more completely.

235
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,160
And this is a little
bit of a add-on.

236
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,660
I was going to make a
whole video on this.

237
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,250
But I think, on some level,
it might be a

238
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,480
little obvious for you.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,190
So let's say we had-- let
me get a good one here.

240
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,910
Let's say we had negative
x to the third, plus 17x

241
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,180
squared, minus 70x.

242
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,130
Immediately, you say, gee, this
isn't even a quadratic.

243
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,770
I don't know how to solve
something like this.

244
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,580
It has an x to third power.

245
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,150
And the first thing you should
realize is that every term

246
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,840
here is divisible by x.

247
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,920
So let's factor out an x.

248
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,260
Or even better, let's factor
out a negative x.

249
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,320
So if you factor out a negative
x, this is equal to

250
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,730
negative x times-- negative
x to the third divided by

251
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,810
negative x is x squared.

252
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,910
17x squared divided by negative
x is negative 17x.

253
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,510
Negative 70x divided by negative
x is positive 70.

254
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,060
The x's cancel out.

255
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,050
And now, you have something
that might look

256
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,220
a little bit familiar.

257
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,530
We have just a standard
quadratic where the leading

258
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,650
coefficient is a 1.

259
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,290
We just have to find two numbers
whose product is 70,

260
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,000
and that add up to
negative 17.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,920
And the numbers that immediately
jumped into my

262
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,410
head are negative 10
and negative 7.

263
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,520
You take their product,
you get 70.

264
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,870
You add them up, you
get negative 17.

265
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,920
So this part right here is
going to be x minus 10,

266
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,410
times x minus 7.

267
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,540
And of course, you have that
leading negative x.

268
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,330
The general idea here is just
see if there's anything you

269
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,320
can factor out.

270
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,780
And that'll get it into a form
that you might recognize.

271
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,950
Hopefully, you found
this helpful.

272
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,145
I want to reiterate what I
showed you at the beginning of

273
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:41,510
this video.

274
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,960
I think it's a really cool
trick, so to speak, to be able

275
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:49,470
to factor things that have
a non-1 or non-negative 1

276
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,460
leading coefficient.

277
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,720
But to some degree, you're going
to find out easier ways

278
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,370
to do this, especially
with the quadratic

279
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,620
formula, in not too long.
