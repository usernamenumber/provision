1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,290
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,580
I'm just trying to show you as
many examples as possible of

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,560
solving exact differential
equations.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,210
One, trying to figure
out whether the

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,350
equations are exact.

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,650
And then if you know they're
exact, how do you figure out

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,470
the psi and figure out
the solution of the

9
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,650
differential equation?

10
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:27,820
So the next one in my book is
3x squared minus 2xy plus 2

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:40,400
times dx, plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3 times

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,060
dy is equal to 0.

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,040
So just the way it was
written, this isn't

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,330
superficially in that form
that we want, right?

15
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,370
What's the form that we want?

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,120
We want some function of x and
y plus another function of x

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,530
and y, times y prime, or
dy dx, is equal to 0.

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,570
We're close.

19
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,410
How could we get this equation
into this form?

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,580
We just divide both sides of
this equation by dx, right?

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:14,110
And then we get 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,530
We're dividing by dx, so that
dx just becomes a 1.

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,830
Plus 6y squared minus
x squared plus 3.

24
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,360
And then we're dividing by dx,
so that becomes dy dx, is

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,190
equal to-- what's
0 divided by dx?

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,430
Well it's just 0.

27
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,200
And there we have it.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,800
We have written this
in the form that we

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,580
need, in this form.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,260
And now we need to prove to
ourselves that this is an

31
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,390
exact equation.

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,670
So let's do that.

33
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,660
So what's the partial of M?

34
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,180
This is the M function, right?

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,380
This was a plus here.

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,980
What's the partial of this
with respect to y?

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,450
This would be 0.

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,980
This would be minus 2x,
and then just a 2.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,070
So the partial of this with
respect to y is minus 2x.

40
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,490
What's the partial of
N with respect to x?

41
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,550
This would be 0, this
would be minus 2x.

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,470
So there you have it.

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,620
The partial of M with respect
to y is equal to the partial

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,170
of N with respect to x.

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,870
My is equal to Nx.

46
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,650
So we are dealing with
an exact equation.

47
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,020
So now we have to find psi.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,910
   

49
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,360
The partial of psi with respect
to x is equal to M,

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,840
which is equal to 3x squared
minus 2xy plus 2.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,890
Take the anti-derivative with
respect to x on both sides,

52
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,510
and you get psi is equal to x
to the third minus x squared

53
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,740
y-- because y is just a
constant-- plus 2x, plus some

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,270
function of y.

55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,530
Right?

56
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,620
Because we know psi is a
function of x and y.

57
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,220
So when you take a derivative,
when you take a partial with

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,920
respect to just x, a pure
function of just y would get

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,510
lost. So it's like the constant,
when we first

60
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,620
learned taking anti-derivatives.

61
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,880
And now, to figure out psi, we
just have to solve for h of y.

62
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,340
And how do we do that?

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,110
Well let's take the partial
of psi with respect to y.

64
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,140
That's going to be equal
to this right here.

65
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,520
So The partial of psi with
respect to y, this is 0, this

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,815
is minus x squared.

67
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:33,210
So it's minus x squared-- this
is o-- plus h prime of y, is

68
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,290
going to be able to what?

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,520
That's going to be equal
to our n of x, y.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,970
It's going to be able to this.

71
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,080
And then we can solve
for this.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,580
So that's going to be equal
to 6y squared minus x

73
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,096
squared plus 3.

74
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,610
You can add x squared
to both sides to get

75
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,760
rid of this and this.

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,290
And then we're left with h
prime of y is equal to 6y

77
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,650
squared plus 3.

78
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:06,850
Anti-derivative-- so h of y is
equal to what is this-- 2y

79
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,260
cubed plus 3y.

80
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,920
And you could put a plus c
there, but the plus c merges

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,080
later on when we solve the
differential equation, so you

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,040
don't have to worry
about it too much.

83
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,459
So what is our function psi?

84
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll write it in a new color.

85
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:30,240
Our function psi as a function
of x and y is equal to x to

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,150
the third minus x squared
y plus 2x.

87
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,800
Plus h of y, which we
just solved for.

88
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,030
So h of y is plus 2y to
the third plus 3y.

89
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,870
And then they're could be a plus
c there, but you'll see

90
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,890
that it doesn't matter much.

91
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,390
Actually I want to do something

92
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,690
a little bit different.

93
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm not just going to chug
through the problem.

94
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,740
I want to kind of go back
to the intuition.

95
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,120
Because I don't want this to
be completely mechanical.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,310
Let me just show you what the
derivative-- using what we

97
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,810
knew before you even learned
anything about the partial

98
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,090
derivative chain rule-- what is
the derivative of psi with

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,340
respect to x.

100
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,580
   

101
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,770
What is the derivative of
psi with respect to x?

102
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,760
Here we just use our implicit
differentiation skills.

103
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,520
So the derivative of this-- I'll
do it in a new color-- 3x

104
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,810
squared minus-- now we're going
to have to use the chain

105
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,190
rule here-- so the derivative
of the first expression with

106
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,570
respect to x is-- well, let me
just put the minus sign and I

107
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,510
could put like that-- so it's
2x times y plus the first

108
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,080
function, x squared times the
derivative of the second

109
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,260
function with respect to x.

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,710
Well that's just
y prime, right?

111
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,430
It's the derivative of y with
respect to y is 1, times the

112
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,890
derivative of y with respect to
x, which is just y prime.

113
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,740
Fair enough.

114
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,940
Plus the derivative of this with
respect to x is easy, 2.

115
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,020
Plus the derivative of this
with respect to x.

116
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,710
Well let's take the derivative
of this with respect to y

117
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,580
first. We're just doing implicit
differentiation of

118
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,770
the chain rule.

119
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:18,480
So this is plus 6y squared.

120
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,320
And then we're using the chain
rule, so we took the

121
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,390
derivative with respect to y.

122
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,500
And then you have to multiply
that times the derivative of y

123
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,450
with respect x, which
is just y prime.

124
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,280
Plus the derivative of this
with respect to why is 3

125
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,350
times-- we're just doing the
chain rule-- the derivative of

126
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,410
y with respect to x.

127
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,550
So that's y prime.

128
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,700
Let's try to see if we
can simplify this.

129
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:51,550
So we get this is equal to 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2.

130
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,320
So that's this term, this
term, and this term.

131
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,970
   

132
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,700
Plus-- let's just put the y
prime outside-- y prime

133
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,240
times-- let's see, you have a
negative sign out here-- minus

134
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:18,730
x squared plus 6y
squared plus 3.

135
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,780
So this is the derivative of
our psi as we solved it.

136
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,670
Look at this closely and notice
that that is the same--

137
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,170
hopefully it's the same--
as our original problem.

138
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,630
What was our original problem
that we started working with?

139
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:45,440
The original problem was 3x
squared minus 2xy plus 2, plus

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,010
6y squared minus x square
plus 3, times y

141
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,070
prime, is equal to 0.

142
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,650
So this was our original
problem.

143
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,170
And notice that the derivative
of psi with respect to x just

144
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,020
using implicit differentiation
is exactly this.

145
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,970
So hopefully this gives you a
little intuition of why we can

146
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,980
just rewrite this equation as
the derivative with respect x

147
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,720
of psi, which is a function
of x and y, is equal to 0.

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
Because this is the derivative
of psi with respect to x.

149
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,870
I wrote out here.

150
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,830
It's the same thing-- this
right here-- right?

151
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,710
So that equals 0.

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,310
So if we take the
anti-derivative of both sides,

153
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,620
we know that the solution of
this differential equation is

154
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,909
that psi of x and y is equal
to c as the solution.

155
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,780
And we know what psi is, so we
just set that equal to c, and

156
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,470
we have the implicit-- we have a
solution to the differential

157
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,490
equation, I'll just
define implicitly.

158
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,890
So the solution-- you don't have
to do this every time.

159
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:50,010
This step right here you
wouldn't have to do if you're

160
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,190
taking a test, unless
the teacher

161
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,440
explicitly asked for it.

162
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,170
I just wanted kind of make sure
that you know what you're

163
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,420
doing, that you're not just
doing things completely

164
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,000
mechanically.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,280
That you really see that the
derivative of psi really does

166
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,560
give you-- we solved for psi.

167
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,490
And I just wanted to show you
that the derivative of psi

168
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,980
with respect to x, just using
implicit differentiation and

169
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,700
our standard chain rule,
actually gives you the left

170
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,450
hand side of the differential
equation, which was our

171
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,640
version of problem.

172
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,600
And then that's how we know that
that the derivative of

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,730
psi with respect x is equal
to 0, because our original

174
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,390
differential equation
was equal to 0.

175
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,950
You take the anti-derivative of
both sides of this, you get

176
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,510
psi is equal to C, is
the solution of the

177
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,210
differential equation.

178
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,190
Or if you wanted to write it
out, psi is this thing.

179
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,215
Our solution to the differential
equation is x to

180
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:42,530
the third, minus x squared y,
plus 2x, plus 2y to the third,

181
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:51,060
plus 3y, is equal to c, is the
implicitly defined solution of

182
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,940
our original differential
equation.

183
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,050
Anyway I've run out
of time again.

184
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,440
I will see you in
the next video.

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,500
