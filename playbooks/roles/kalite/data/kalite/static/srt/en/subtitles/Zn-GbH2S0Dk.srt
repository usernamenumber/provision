99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Welcome to my presentation on level 3 linear equations

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets make up a problem. Let's say I had

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x+2x+3=-7x-5.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, in all these linear equations, the first

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thing we try to do is get all of our

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
variables on one side of the equation and

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then get all of our constant terms and then

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it will become a level one linear equation.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the first thing we can do is

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can simplify each of the sides.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, on the left side we have this x+2x.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, what is x+2x?

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well that's like saying I have one apple

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now I have two apples so here I have

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one x and now I have two more x's

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that I'm adding together so that equals 3x.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3x+3=-7x-5.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's bring the 7x over onto the left hand side

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you can do that by adding 7x to both sides.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a review.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're adding the opposite so it's negative 7x

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we add 7x so that's why.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we do that because on the right side

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these two will cancel and the left side

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we get 10x+3= and on the right side

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all we have left is the -5.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Almost there. Now we're at a level 2 problem.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now we just have to take the three and move it

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the other side and we can do that by

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
subtracting three from both sides.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The left hand side; the threes cancel out.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That why we put them there in the first place.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you have 10x= and then -5 minus 3

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, that equals -8.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, we just multiply both sides of this equation by

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1/10, or the reciprocal of 10 which is the

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
coeffecient on x.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You could also...

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some people will say we are dividing both sides

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by 10, which is essentially what we are doing.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you divide by 10, that's the same thing as

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiplying by 1/10.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well anyway on the left side, 1/10 times ten

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, that equals one so we're just left with x equals

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-8/10. That can be reduced further.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They both share the common factor, 2.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you divide by 2. That's a minus 4 over 5.
