1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,670
A couple of videos ago, we
saw that in classic C-3

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,240
photosynthesis-- and once again
it's called C-3 because

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,770
the first time that carbon
dioxide is fixed, it's fixed

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,470
into a 3-carbon molecule.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,590
But we saw the problem with C-3
photosynthesis is that the

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,580
enzyme that does the carbon
fixation, it can also react

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,430
with oxygen.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,470
And when oxygen essentially
reacts with ribulose

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,110
biphosphate instead of your
carbon, you get an

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,330
unproductive reaction.

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,390
Not only is it unproductive,
it'll actually suck up your

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,900
ATP and your NADPH and
you'll go nowhere.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,540
So every now and then, when
oxygen bonds here instead of a

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,240
carbon dioxide, you get
nothing produced, net.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,910
Everything becomes
less efficient.

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,740
And so in the last video, we
saw that some plants have

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,660
evolved a way to get
around this.

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,390
And what they do is, they fix
their carbon on the outside,

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,930
on cells that are actually
exposed to the air.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,090
And then once they fix the
carbon they actually fix it

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,850
into a 4-carbon molecule, into
oxaloacetate And then that

23
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,740
gets turned into malate Then
they pump the malate deeper

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,930
within the leaf, where you
aren't exposed to oxygen.

25
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,720
And then they take the carbon
dioxide off the malate, and

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,940
this is where they actually
perform the Calvin cycle.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,540
And even though you do have
your rubiscos still there,

28
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,830
your rubisco isn't going to
have-- the photorespiration is

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,980
not going to occur.

30
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,980
Because it only has access
to carbon dioxide.

31
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,710
It does not have access to
this oxygen out here.

32
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,950
Now that's a very efficient
way of producing sugars.

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,630
And that's why some of the
plants that we associate with

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,100
being very strong sugar, or even
ethanol producers, all

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,610
perform C-4 photosynthesis.

36
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:49,360
Corn, sugarcane,
and crab grass.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,850
And these are all very, very
efficient sugar producers.

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,260
Because they don't have to
worry too much about

39
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,890
photorespiration.

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,400
Now some plants have a slightly
different problem.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,970
They're not so worried about the
efficiency of the process.

42
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,750
They're more worried
about losing water.

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,040
And you can imagine what
plants these are.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,150
These are plants that
are in the desert.

45
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,900
Because these stomata, these
pores that are on the leaves,

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,720
they let in air, but they
can also let out water.

47
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,970
I mean, if I'm in the
rainforest, I

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,080
don't care about that.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,220
But if I'm in the middle of the
desert, I don't want to

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,230
let out water vapor through
my stomata.

51
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,460
So the ideal situation is, I
would want my stomata closed

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,140
during the daytime.

53
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,730
This is what I want.

54
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,120
So I want-- if I'm in
the desert, let

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,510
me make this clear.

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:46,310
If I'm in the desert I want
stomata closed during the day.

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,230
For obvious reasons.

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,580
I don't want all my water
to vaporize out of

59
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,090
these holes in my leaves.

60
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,900
But at the same time, the
problem is that photosynthesis

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,580
can only occur during
the daytime.

62
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,880
And that includes the
dark reactions.

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,040
Remember, I've said multiple
times, the dark reactions are

64
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,680
badly named.

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,800
They're more the light
independent reactions.

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,220
But they both occur
simultaneously-- the light

67
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,600
independent and light
dependent-- and only during

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,850
the daytime.

69
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:21,410
   

70
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,360
And if your stomata is closed,
you need to perform

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,190
photosynthesis, especially the
Calvin cycle, you need CO2.

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,650
So how can you get
around this?

73
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,870
If I want to close my stomata
during the day, but I need CO2

74
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,660
during the day, how can
I solve this problem?

75
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,700
And what desert plants, or
many desert plants, have

76
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,240
evolved to do, essentially
does photosynthesis, but

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,250
instead of fixing the carbon
in outer cells and then

78
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,070
pushing it in to inner cells and
then performing the Calvin

79
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,370
cycle, instead of outer and
inner cells, they do it at the

80
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,100
nighttime and in the daytime.

81
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,940
So in CAM plants-- and these are
called CAM plants because,

82
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,235
I could tell you what
it stands for.

83
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,180
It stands for crassulacean
acid metabolism.

84
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,380
And that's because it was first
observed in that species

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,200
of plants, the crassulacean
plant.

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,260
But these are just called,
you could call it CAM

87
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,720
photosynthesis or CAM plants.

88
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,480
They're essentially a subset
of C-4 plants.

89
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,029
But instead of performing C-4
photosynthesis, kind of an

90
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,670
outside cells and inside cells,
they do it at the

91
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,920
nighttime and the day.

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:33,420
   

93
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,545
And what they do is, at night
they keep their stomata open.

94
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:44,890
   

95
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,190
And they perform, and they're
able to fix-- and everything

96
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,960
occurs in the mesophyll
cells and the CAM

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,290
cells, in the CAM plants.

98
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,350
So at nighttime, when they're
not afraid of losing water--

99
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,790
let's say this is a mesophyll
cell right here--

100
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,160
my stomata is open.

101
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,280
Let's say that this is my
stomata right there.

102
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,090
And so it lets in
carbon dioxide.

103
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,870
I'm not worried about
losing water vapor.

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,190
It's night time right now.

105
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,150
So carbon dioxide
comes in here.

106
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,870
And then it fixes the
carbon dioxide.

107
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,650
It fixes it the exact same way
that the C-4 plants do.

108
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,080
So you have your CO2 come in.

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,680
You have your PEP .

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,910
It's all facilitated by PEP
carboxylase That's the enzyme.

111
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,570
That can only fix CO2, that can
only react with CO2, not

112
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,470
with oxygen.

113
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,430
And then that is used to
produce-- and we saw it here

114
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,460
in our CAM-4 diagram in the last
video, that is to used to

115
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,490
produce malate.

116
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,025
A 4-carbon molecule.

117
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:52,920
   

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,380
And then the malate-- and then
this is what's key-- the

119
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,640
malate get stored in other
organelles in the cell.

120
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,775
In the vacuoles , which are, you
can kind of view them as

121
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,920
large storage containers
in the cell.

122
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,620
So I drew this as
the whole cell.

123
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,990
I mean, this is actually all
occurring in your chloroplast.

124
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,430
But you can imagine your cell
having a big storage center

125
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,180
where the malate gets
stored at night.

126
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,480
And you can view malate as
almost a carbon dioxide store.

127
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,750
Because later on we can
access the malate and

128
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,180
get the carbon dioxide.

129
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,670
And that's exactly what these
CAM plants are going to do.

130
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,380
So this is nighttime.

131
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,520
Then the sun comes up.

132
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,050
So now we're in the daytime.

133
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,255
This desert plant, well maybe
it's a cactus, it doesn't want

134
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,620
to lose its water vapor.

135
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,870
So it closes its stomata.

136
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,290
   

137
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,110
This particular stoma
now is closed.

138
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,090
It's now closed.

139
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,380
And you say, oh boy, how
is it going to perform

140
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,680
photosynthesis?

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
Well, it can perform
photosynthesis in

142
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,085
that very same cell.

143
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:52,830
   

144
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,660
Because it stored up all of
this malate at night.

145
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,870
And so now the malate can be
pumped out of the vacuoles

146
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,950
into the stroma of our
chloroplast. And then you can

147
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,460
have pyruvate break off.

148
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,990
But the more important thing
is you have CO2 break off.

149
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,160
So you have a ready
supply of CO2.

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,290
And now we can perform our
standard Calvin cycle.

151
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,040
And in an environment only
with CO2, our stomata is

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,300
closed, so we're ready to go.

153
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,330
Our CO2 reacts with ribulose
bisphosphate It is catalyzed

154
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,420
by rubisco It's the whole
Calvin cycle and we

155
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,660
produced our sugar.

156
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,340
So this is kind of a
neat adaptation.

157
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,500
In these high, very efficient
sugar-producing plants that

158
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,430
aren't worried about water, they
perform carbon fixation

159
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,690
on things that are exposed to
the air and then they pump

160
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,160
kind of a stored version of
the carbon deeper into the

161
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,280
leaf to actually perform the
Calvin cycle so that it's not

162
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,080
lossy, so that

163
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,380
photorespiration doesn't occur.

164
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,750
Because down here you
have no oxygen.

165
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,700
The desert plants benefit from
that property as well, but

166
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,820
their whole concern is, I don't
want to keep my stomata

167
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,370
open in the daytime.

168
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,650
So what I do is, I fix
my carbon at night.

169
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,160
But I use the exact
same process.

170
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,830
I use PEP carboxylase
And I store my

171
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,540
carbon dioxide at night.

172
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,940
And in the daytime, I can
actually-- when my

173
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,310
light-dependant reactions are
occurring, they're producing

174
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,780
my ATP and my NADH I can also
perform my dark reactions in

175
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,410
the daytime.

176
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,550
As I said, the dark reactions
always occur in the daytime.

177
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,430
Or my light-independent
reactions.

178
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,790
Because even though my stomata
is closed, I have a store of

179
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,224
carbon dioxide in the
form of malate.

180
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,082
