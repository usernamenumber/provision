1
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:18,193
What was the last time you had to do this? Or this?

2
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:22,120
To get across a stream, river, field, or lava pit?

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,668
Probably never, because we have these things called bridges.

4
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:28,814
Bridges are awesome!

5
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,693
But what are all these different types of bridges that you see around?

6
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,480
Why don't they all look the same?

7
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,780
Lets find out. Engineering!

8
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:43,325
The most basic type of bridge is a beam bridge.

9
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:51,601
It has the most simple design with the beam, also called the "bridge deck" that is supported at both ends.

10
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,587
Lets drop into our diagram mode to see how the forces act upon this bridge.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,154
When a load is applied to these bridges they bend and experience 2 types of forces:

12
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,516
The top of the beam is pushed together, which is called, "compression".

13
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:10,583
The bottom of the bridge is pulled apart, which is called, "tension".

14
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:20,717
Here we are using lasers to build model bridges out of balsa wood and plywood.

15
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,754
Always wear purple gloves while handling balsa wood.

16
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,300
Safety first kids.

17
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:27,424
You can see the simple design.

18
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,640
Now lets see what happens when we apply forces to it.

19
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:36,314
To do this, we'll use a compression tester, that can apply up to 20,000 pounds of force.

20
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,387
Although we probably won't get that high in this test.

21
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:44,967
The compression tester will apply a load, in other words a weight, and measure the strength.

22
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:48,111
Which is how far the material moves in response to a load.

23
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:55,184
Also to help us on this test will be these Lego people, who will measure the ability to be launched from a bridge when it brakes.

24
00:01:55,922 --> 00:02:00,342
Critical information for bridge designers, officer. Hello!

25
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,456
You see that as the load increases, the bridge bends.

26
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:10,023
And eventually brakes at a load of 115 pounds.

27
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,211
But now, what if you wanted to span a longer distance?

28
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,081
Here we use the same deck material on top, but we have doubled the length of the bridge.

29
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:28,317
This time our main test subjects will be the happy farmer chef, hatman, bike guy, with no helmet.

30
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:29,603
Shame on you!

31
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:34,067
You can see that the longer bridge bends even more.

32
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:38,002
And it breaks at a much lower load. Only 25 pounds.

33
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,688
Which is 80% weaker than the short beam bridge.

34
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,285
Plus, the Lego people get launched into space.

35
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:49,796
That isn't very good. We want the bridge to support a lot of weight over a long distance.

36
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:53,202
So how can we make bridges that span longer distances?

37
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:59,304
They're other bridge designs that allow us to use the same deck material and span longer distances.

38
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,854
This takes us to the curviest of bridges, arch bridges.

39
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:11,176
An arch is a great way to evenly distribute a load and is been used in bridge building for a long time.

40
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,811
In this example we just have a beam bridge with an arch underneath.

41
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:23,109
The load is distributed through the arch into the ground.

42
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:27,912
Notice how compression forces are present and no tension forces.

43
00:03:29,712 --> 00:03:34,632
This is great for wood and stone bridges because they are much stronger in compression than tension.

44
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,694
In our model arch bridge, we use the same long bridge length, but added arch supports on both sides.

45
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:51,310
To help us, this tricycle man, helmet, good job, classy business woman, and this... crazy guy.

46
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,560
Lets go!

47
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:57,485
You can see that the beam does not bend as much with the arch underneath.

48
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:06,332
And that reaches a higher load before it fails, 100 pounds, which is 500% stronger than the long beam bridge.

49
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:11,773
Here we have seen that beam bridges get weaker, as they get longer.

50
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:17,116
Adding an arch makes the bridge very strong, but arches have length limitations.

51
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:22,514
Beam and arch bridges, historically have relied on wood and stone as building materials.

52
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:27,384
These materials are usually only strong in compression and not in tension.

53
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,328
Which restricted the designs that could be used.

54
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:38,177
However, with the discovery of steel, bridge builders now have the ability to add structural units that would be strong in tension.

55
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:43,606
This led to more intricate styles of bridges that we will explore in our next video.
