1
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:04,098
In a previous video we have already shown that if we have some circles

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:05,733
centered oh right over here

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:11,785
and if "OD" is a raidus, and it's a radius that bisects chord "AC"

4
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:13,582
So bisects means that it kind of splits it into two

5
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:15,847
Then "AB" = "BC"

6
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,448
We've proved in a previous video that "OD" will be perpendicular to "AC"

7
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:25,080
So we have proven that we can assume that it's perpendicular

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:33,213
And the video that you might want to view is "For radius is perpendicular to chord

9
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:35,599
You will hopefully find the proof of that.

10
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,681
What I want to do in this video is go the other way.

11
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:42,477
If we know that "OD" is a radius that is perpendicular to chord "AC"

12
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:46,099
what I want to do with this video is proe that it's bisecting

13
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,975
So we are not assuming that it's bisecting in this video over here.

14
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:50,528
We are just assuming that it's perpendicular

15
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,524
So essentially we are going to go the other way.

16
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:55,999
So here we start with the fact that it bisected and we established that they were perpendicular

17
00:00:55,999 --> 00:01:00,478
That was in the previous video. Now we are going to start with the assumption that they are perpendicular

18
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,818
and then prove that they bisect

19
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,492
And just like what we did in the previous proof we will set up some triangles here

20
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:08,378
since we know a lot about triangles now.

21
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:11,331
And we will set up the triangles by drawing two more radii

22
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:16,185
Radius "OC" and radius "OA"

23
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:21,176
and that's useful for us because we know that they are both radii for the same circle

24
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:24,404
So they have the same length as the radii don't change in a circle

25
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:29,209
and you may already see where this is going because triangle "O"

26
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,123
and let me label this point here, let me call it "M"

27
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:34,150
because we are hoping that it ends up being the midpoint

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,741
of "AC". Triangle "AMO" is a right triangle

29
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,873
This is its hypotenuese. "AO" is it's hypoteneuse

30
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:45,200
triangle "OMC" is a right triangle and this is it's hypotenuese right there

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,634
We already showed that its hypoteneuses have the same length and both of these right triangles

32
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:54,964
share segment or side "OM"

33
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:59,052
So "OM" is clearly equal to itself

34
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:03,049
and in a previous video, not the same video where we explained this thing

35
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:09,102
In a previous video (I think) it's called "More on why SSA is not a postulate"

36
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:15,955
We say that SSA is not a postulate, not a congruency postulate

37
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:26,536
but we did establish in tha video that "RSH" is a congruency postulate

38
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:32,551
and "RSH" tells us that if we have a right triangle thats where they "R" comes from

39
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,345
If we have a right triangle and we have one of the sides (which ihappens to be congruent)

40
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:41,108
and our hypotenuese is congruent. Then we have two congruent triangles

41
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:43,584
And if you look at this right over here.

42
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,985
We have two right triangles. "AMO" is a right triangle "CMO" is a right triangle

43
00:02:46,985 --> 00:02:52,365
they have one leg that is congruent right over here. "MO" and then both of their hypotenueses are congruent

44
00:02:52,365 --> 00:03:04,918
to each other. So by "RSH" we know that triangle "AMO" is congruent to triangle "CMO"

45
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:12,152
by "RSH", by the "Rsh" postulate

46
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:16,466
And so we know that if they are congruent then their corresponding sides have to be congruent

47
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:28,317
So based on that we then know that "AM" is a correspinding side to "MC"

48
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:35,202
So we know that "AM" must be equal to "MC" because they are correspinding sides

49
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:43,505
of congruency. This implies that those are equal and if those are equal then we know that "OD" is

50
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:47,667
Bisecting "AC" so we have established what we can do

51
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:53,042
Anothe way that we can prove it without "RSH" is just straight up with the pythagoran theorem

52
00:03:53,042 --> 00:04:01,028
We know already from these two radii that I have set up over here that "OA"

53
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:11,389
is equal to "OC" and we also know that "OM" is literally equal to itself

54
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:21,909
and we also knwo from the Pythagoream Theorem that "AM" squared

55
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:32,502
plus "OM" squared is equal to "OA" squared

56
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:42,070
the squares of the length of the two legs squared summed up is equal to the length of the hypotenuese

57
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,325
So we know that for the left triangle right over here

58
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:51,385
"AMO" and we can set up the same relationship for "CMO"

59
00:04:51,385 --> 00:05:07,949
We know in "CMO" "CM" squared plus "OM" squared is equal to "OC" squared

60
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:13,686
Now we know a few things

61
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:16,424
We know that "OA" is equal to "OC"

62
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:20,716
So for example right over here we have "OA" squared we could replace this with "OC"

63
00:05:20,716 --> 00:05:28,482
and then you can already see where this is going

64
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:31,537
You can see that "CM" and "AM" are the same and if you want to do it a little more formally

65
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:35,743
you can subtract "OM" squared from both sides of this equation andn you will get

66
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:41,191
"AM" squared is equal to "OC" squared)

67
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:43,687
(I've replaced this with "OC" squared

68
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:47,880
Minus "OM" squared on the left hand side right over here

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,085
and then on the right hand side

70
00:05:51,085 --> 00:06:01,854
As we subtract "OM" squared from both sides we have "CM" squared is equal to "OC" squared minus "OM"

71
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:06,034
squared and then we can take the pricipal root of both sides of this because we really care about the

72
00:06:06,034 --> 00:06:08,301
positive root ( we do not want to have negative distances.

73
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,030
So if you take the pricipal root of both sides this becomes "AM" is equal to the principle root of that

74
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,149
and we also get that "CM" is equal to the principle root of that

75
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:20,457
Well these two quantities are the same so "AM" must be equal

76
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:24,641
to "CM"

77
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:26,879
They are both equal to this quantity right here

78
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,182
and so "CM" might be a bisector

79
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,779
and this is really common sense

80
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:37,181
If you know that two sides of two different right triangles are going to be congruent to each other you

81
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:41,593
can always use th pythagorean theorem to get the third side and then

82
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:47,894
the third side is uniquely constrained by the lengths of the other two sides

83
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:50,165
because it is a right triangle

84
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,477
and so these are all ways of getting to the same thing

85
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:54,635
But now we can feel pretty good about the fact that if

86
00:06:54,635 --> 99:59:59,999
"OD" is perpendicular here it's definately going to bisect this chord
