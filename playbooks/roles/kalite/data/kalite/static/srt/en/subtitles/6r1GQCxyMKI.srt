1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,955
Now that you know what the conic
sections are and why they're

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,280
called conic sections, let's
see if we can understand the

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,870
actual equations of the conic
sections a little bit better,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,030
and use that knowledge to be
able to at least recognize them

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,110
when we see the equation, and
then if we see the equation,

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,780
know how to plot them.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,950
So the first one we'll start
off with is the circle.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,330
And you've probably seen this
for many years already,

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,270
but I'll review, if you
don't know it already.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,490
The general form of an
equation, or the general

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:38,200
equation for a circle, is x
squared plus y squared is equal

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,830
to r squared, where r is
the radius of the circle.

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,900
And this would be a circle
centered at the point 0,0.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,220
So I'll just draw this kind of
a general graph right here.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,880
So that's the x-axis, that's
the y-axis, the circle will

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,020
look like this-- let me do it
in a different color-- the

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,900
circle would look something
like-- make sure it's a

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,320
circle-- well, it's supposed to
be centered at 0,0, but that's

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,390
close enough-- so its center
will be right here, and the

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,940
radius if you go from the
center to any point along that

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,800
circle will have a distance of
r, so if you go from there to

22
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,940
there it's r, from there to
there it's r, from there to

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,050
there it's r, and to some
degree, this formula, all it is

24
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,580
is an extension of the distance
formula, which is really just

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,020
the extension of the
Pythagorean Theorem.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,490
So for example, the distance
formula, if I want to know the

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:42,600
distance between some point x,y
and the point 0,0, what you do

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,720
is, you take the difference of
the x's-- so x minus 0-- you

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,550
square that, and then you add
that to the distance between

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:58,390
the y's squared-- so that's one
y point minus 0y-- y is equal

31
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,560
to 0-- square that, and that is
equal to the distance squared.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,830
So if you simplify this, x
minus 0 squared, that's just

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,610
x squared plus-- and this
is just y squared is equal

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,890
to distance squared.

35
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,160
So essentially, this equation
is the plot of all points that

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,560
are exactly d away, a distance
of d away, from the point 0,0,

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,270
and that's just a circle.

38
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,010
And I'll let you think about
it, I think I actually showed

39
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,090
this to you in a distance
formula video, but the distance

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,560
formula just comes out of
the Pythagorean Theorem.

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,940
And if that's not completely
obvious for you, just think

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,540
about a little bit, and
it'll hopefully become a

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,305
little bit more obvious.

44
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,650
But anyway, this was probably--
you probably already knew this,

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,730
and actually just to hit the
point home, if we had the

46
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:47,890
equation like this x squared
plus y squared is equal to 9,

47
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,232
the graph of this circle
would look like this.

48
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:56,120
So that's the x-axis, that's
the y-axis, then draw the

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,300
circle itself, circle looks
like-- close enough, and then

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,850
the distance or the radius from
the center of the circle,

51
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,530
that's going to be 3.

52
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,250
There's a 9 here, why
isn't the radius 9?

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,740
Oh, that's because this
is the radius squared.

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,650
Remember the original formula I
just showed you. x squared plus

55
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,470
y squared is equal
to r squared.

56
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,630
So this right here is r
squared, so if r squared

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,370
is equal to 9, than
r is equal to 3.

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,410
It can't be minus 3.

59
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,430
I mean, it could, you can't
have a negative radius, or if

60
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,790
you did you're just going in
the other direction, but

61
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,530
it's the same thing.

62
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,460
So the radius is equal to 3.

63
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,480
So that's a circle, and that's
pretty straightforward, but in

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,790
a lot of algebra classes, they
complicate the issue a little

65
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,700
bit by shifting the circle.

66
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,290
So let's just shift
this circle.

67
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,600
Instead of having-- so
let me just rewrite it.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,990
So the unshifted circle was x
squared plus y squared is equal

69
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,920
to-- let me write it this way--
is equal to 3 squared, that's

70
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,050
the same thing as 9, and let's
say that the new circle, the

71
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:13,730
shifted circle, is x minus 1
squared plus y plus 2 squared

72
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,650
is equal to 3 squared.

73
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,830
Now all of a sudden this looks
really complicated and daunting

74
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,240
and all the rest, but all you
have to recognize is, we just

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,662
substituted an x minus 1 for
the-- whoops, messed

76
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:28,950
up my pointer.

77
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,740
We just substituted an x
minus 1 for the x, and

78
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,280
we just substituted a
y plus 2 for the y.

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,870
So it has the same basic
pattern as of this circle, and

80
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,610
the fact that we added or
subtracted numbers from the x's

81
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,440
and the y's tells us that we
shifted the circle, and so the

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,260
next obvious question is,
where did you shift it to?

83
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,310
And your impulse might be, oh,
well maybe I shifted it to,

84
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:06,430
instead of the center being
0,0, your intuition might be

85
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,280
to say that, well, now the
center is at negative 1,2.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,760
And you'd be almost right,
except you'd be exactly the

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,120
opposite of the correct answer.

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:26,960
The new center is now x is
equal to positive 1 and

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,060
y is equal to minus 2.

90
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,380
And that might be unintuitive
for you at first-- and you

91
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,480
might want to watch some of the
videos, I think I've done them

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,460
already, or I've always
intended to, on shifting

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,570
functions-- but the way to
think about it is the center

94
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,070
here is x is equal to 0.

95
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,110
So when x and y is equal to 0,
x squared plus y squared is 0,

96
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,570
you're exactly 0 away from the
center, or we're at the center.

97
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,010
So now if we want to be-- if we
want x to be 0 away from our

98
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,220
new center, this term
has to be equal to 0.

99
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,680
And if-- just like when x was
equal to 0, this term equaled

100
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,360
0, so now for us to be at the
center of our new circle, so to

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,500
speak, this term has to be 0.

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,240
So the new center has to
be at x is equal to 1.

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,040
Likewise, this has to be
0, and so the center

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,710
is at y is equal to 2.

105
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,400
Another way to think about it
is this-- let's say when y,

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,880
you know what happens here
when y is equal to 2.

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,220
Whatever part of the circle
we're in when y is equal to 2.

108
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,670
There's some part of the circle
we're at, in fact I could draw

109
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,560
it, when y is equal to 2.

110
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,580
Let's say this radius is 3 when
y is equal to 2, we're probably

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,190
right around there
on the circle.

112
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,760
We could be there or
we could be there.

113
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,470
Now we're shifting the circle,
so now instead of being at 0,0,

114
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,860
we're going to be at 1 minus 2.

115
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,160
So now we're going to be at the
new center is x is equal to 1,

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,540
y is equal to minus 2, the new
center is there, and if I were

117
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,080
to draw the new circle, it
would look something like this.

118
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,010
I'm going to try my best
to draw it still as a

119
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,000
circle and show you
that it's been shifted.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,850
No, that's not good.

121
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:18,890
Let me draw it like-- I
pressed the wrong button.

122
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,705
That's not good.

123
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,640
Let me draw it right there.

124
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,560
That's close enough.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,920
I don't have to keep doing it.

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,380
So what we did is we shifted
this circle down 2,

127
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,540
and to the right 1.

128
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,130
So if we take its center
point, we went down 2

129
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,460
and to the right 1.

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,540
And so if you think about up
here, when y was equal to 2, we

131
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,080
could have been at this point
or this point, the kind of

132
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,740
equivalent points of the new
circle are going to be here.

133
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,400
Are going to be roughly here,
where you're shifting it

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,395
down and to the right.

135
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,230
And in order to have that
same behavior in the circle

136
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,550
there, this whole thing
should be equal to 2.

137
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,210
So that same point on the
circle, if this whole thing is

138
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,770
going to be equal to 2--
because it's going to be the

139
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,190
same kind of behavior in the
equation, and I hope I'm not

140
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,680
confusing you there-- then the
new y has to be 0, and

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,430
you see it there.

142
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,730
At both of these points
now, y is equal to 0.

143
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,450
So I know that's a little
unintuitive, but I want you to

144
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,790
sit and think about that a lot.

145
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,220
I mean, you could just memorize
it, that it's the opposite,

146
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,200
when you have x minus 1 and y
plus 2 that it's actually you

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,240
shifted to x is equal to-- the
center is now 1, minus 2, or

148
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,980
you could memorize, if you
like, that what makes this 0

149
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,780
and what makes this 0, and
that's your new center.

150
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,410
But I really want you to
think about it, this

151
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,230
is really a shift.

152
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,660
And of course, if you were
to graph it, you were to

153
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,570
get this thing up there.

154
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,510
Anyway, let me see how
much time I have.

155
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,240
Actually I didn't even
keep track of the time.

156
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,490
I'll leave you there, I'll
continue this in the next video

157
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,810
where I'll talk a little
bit about ellipses.
