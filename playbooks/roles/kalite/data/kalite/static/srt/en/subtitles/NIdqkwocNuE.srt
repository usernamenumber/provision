1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,550
We've been doing a lot of
rotating around the x-axis, so

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,870
let's start rotating around the
y-axis and see what we can do.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,620
Or at least attempt to.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,150
Let's me draw my axes.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,740
That's y-axis.

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,770
That's my x-axis.

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,470
   

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,173
Well let's just do it with an
example, but we'll call it f

10
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:24,460
of x too because it'll
be generalizable.

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,635
Let's just draw y
equals x squared.

12
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,420
   

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,450
Let me just draw the positive
because we're going to rotate

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,900
it around the y-axis and it's
symmetric anyway, so that's

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,160
y equals x squared.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,650
This is y-axis.

17
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,870
This is x-axis.

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,840
Actually, no I'm going to keep
it general, then we'll actually

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,660
solve it particularly.

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,820
So we'll call this f of
x, but clearly this is

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,990
y equals x squared.

22
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,900
This is f of x.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,830
And we know how to take the
volume if I were to rotate

24
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,770
this around the x-axis.

25
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,720
But what if I wanted to say-- I
guess we could call it the area

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:08,030
between 0 and-- I'm trying to
determine how general to be.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,400
Well let's just say
between 0 and 1.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,120
I think the boundaries
might make sense to you.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,360
Roughly this area, and
I'm going to rotate it

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,240
around the y-axis now.

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,460
So what's that final figure
going to look like?

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,870
The base of it-- let me see
how well I can draw it.

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,390
Nope that's not what
I wanted to do.

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,790
The base is going to
look something like a

35
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,750
cylinder like that.

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,830
And then the top of it is also
going to be-- no, that's

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,620
not what I wanted to do.

38
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,560
Let me draw the side lines.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,110
So it's going to look
something like that.

40
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,170
   

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:03,790
And then the top of it
looks something like that.

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,440
But it's not just going
to be cylinder, right?

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,200
If I was doing this entire
block it would be a cylinder.

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,630
But the inside of it is going
to be kind of hollowed out.

45
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,530
Let me see how effective
I am at drawing that.

46
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,340
I'll do it in a
different color.

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,790
So the inside is going
to be hollowed out.

48
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,510
   

49
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,350
I don't know if that
makes sense to you that.

50
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,540
It's kind of like on the inside
it'll look like a bowl.

51
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,310
On the outside it'll look
like a cylinder or a can.

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,990
Hopefully that makes sense.

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,800
You take this and you
rotate this around.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,660
And the curve that specifies
the inside would be y

55
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,060
is equal to x squared.

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,890
It would rotate all
the way around.

57
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,730
I think that makes sense.

58
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,340
The drawing is the
hardest part.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,780
So how do we do it?

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,900
Well even the shape
might give you an idea.

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,910
We can't use that disk method,
what we were doing before when

62
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,090
we were rotating the x-axis,
that was the disk method,

63
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,600
because we were essentially
imagining each of these

64
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,140
particular disks and
then summing them up.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,510
Now we're going to do something
called the shell method.

66
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,460
So what's the shell method?

67
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Instead of taking a bunch of
disks and figuring out their

68
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,180
combined volumes, we're going
to take a bunch of shells.

69
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,430
So what's a shell?

70
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,570
So imagine a rectangle
right here.

71
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,280
Hope you can see
it right there.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,710
Let's say it's at
the point x,1.

73
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,300
What's its height going to be?

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,645
Its height going
to be f of x,1.

75
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:31,200
   

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,990
That's its height.

77
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,150
Now imagine taking that
sliver and rotating

78
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,810
it around the y-axis.

79
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,650
What's it going to look like?

80
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,550
Well, it's going to look like a
shell, it's going to look like

81
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,910
a cylinder, just like the
outside of a cylinder.

82
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,120
It's going to look not too
different then that but I want

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,950
to draw it well because
intuition is the most important

84
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,720
thing that, not getting
the problem right.

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,810
Let me see if I can
draw this respectably.

86
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,230
And then we're going to have
the bottom of the shell, it'll

87
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,520
look something like that.

88
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,910
Let me finish these lines up.

89
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,400
I think you get the point.

90
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,000
OK.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,700
So it's going to look
like a shell like that.

92
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,770
   

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,385
The outside of the shell
is going to be solid.

94
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:29,700
   

95
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,450
And it'll have some width,
but the inside is hollow.

96
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,390
Let me do a different color.

97
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,395
Maybe a darker color to show
that that's the inside.

98
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:42,370
   

99
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,610
You know it's like a
ring essentially.

100
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,980
And so what's the
height of this ring?

101
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,310
The height is going
to be f of x,1.

102
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,070
So let me do a brighter color
so you know what I'm saying.

103
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,470
The height of this
ring is f of x,1.

104
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,530
f of x evaluated at that
arbitrary point we picked up.

105
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,430
What is going to be the
surface area of this ring?

106
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,300
You know, this outside.

107
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,970
Well let's think about it.

108
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,880
It'll be the circumference of
this ring times it's height.

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,530
So what's the circumference
of this ring?

110
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,050
   

111
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,560
Let's go back to our
basic geometry.

112
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Circumference is equal to
2 pi times the radius.

113
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,790
So if we know the radius of it,
we know the circumference.

114
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
Well what's the radius?

115
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,750
Well the radius is how far
we went from the axis of

116
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,510
rotation to that point.

117
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,395
So that's the radius.

118
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:39,460
   

119
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,880
So in our particular
example the radius is x,1.

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,480
   

121
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,610
It's that x point that
we're evaluating it at.

122
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,330
So circumference is going to be
equal to 2 pi times that point

123
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,680
that we're evaluating at.

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,640
And so the surface area-- this
magenta thing that I filled

125
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,060
in-- that's going to be equal
to the circumference times this

126
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,740
height, which we already
said is f of x,1.

127
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,040
   

128
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,900
Let's call it area surface.

129
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,610
Surface area is equal to
circumference times height,

130
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:21,830
which is equal to 2 pi
x,1 times f of x,1.

131
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,640
We figured out the
surface are of this.

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,705
Now how do we figure
out the volume?

133
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:28,560
   

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,840
Well what's the width of it?

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,040
How thick is this ring?

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,630
What's this thickness
right here?

137
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,005
It's a very small thickness.

138
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:38,250
But we took this sliver, and
this sliver as we learned in

139
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,770
previous calculus, the width of
this little rectangle is dx.

140
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,270
And you know when we take the
integral, it's going to get

141
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,670
infinitely smaller and smaller
and we'll have infinitely

142
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,740
more and more of them.

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,870
So the width of this is dx.

144
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,990
Let me draw it big, not
so horrible looking.

145
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,880
So if this is a sliver,
it's width is dx.

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,980
It's height is f of x,1.

147
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,840
x,1 will be right
in the center.

148
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,600
And then it's distance from
the center is of course x,1.

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,980
Hopefully that make sense.

150
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,260
So what's the volume
of this shell?

151
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,450
So the volume of the shell--
this shell, not this one-- the

152
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,570
volume of the shell is going to
be equal to the surface area

153
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,020
of the shell times how
wide that surface is.

154
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,490
And that width is dx, so it's
going to equal this times dx.

155
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,480
So the volume of that
shell is 2 pi x,1 times

156
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,350
f of x,1 times dx.

157
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,350
I think you see where I'm
going with this now.

158
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,170
So what would be the volume
of the entire rotated

159
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,400
figure, this thing here?

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,060
Well I'm just going to sum
up each of these shells.

161
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,920
I have one shell there, then
here I'll have a slightly less

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,880
high shell, and up here I would
have a much bigger shell,

163
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,040
and I'll add them up.

164
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,100
Here's one shell
that goes around.

165
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,200
Then they'll be another shell
here, and I'll add them all up.

166
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,810
And that's taking the integral.

167
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,820
So the total volume of the
figure when I rotate it around

168
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:12,020
the y-axis is going to be-- and
my boundary is from 0 to 1-- 2

169
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,110
pi-- this one I just told you a
particular x,1 but we're going

170
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,560
to sum them over
all of the x's.

171
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,550
So it's going to be
2 pi x f of x dx.

172
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,160
This is just a constant,
so you could call it

173
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,110
2 pi times x f of x.

174
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,550
So let's take a
particular example.

175
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,290
Let's do it for x squared.

176
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,370
Let's say the function
is x squared.

177
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,786
So in this case the volume is
going to equal-- let's take the

178
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:44,500
2 pi out-- 2 pi integral 0 to 1
x times f of x-- f of x in our

179
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,650
case is x squared, which I drew
earlier-- dx equals 2 pi.

180
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,840
This is just x to
the third, right?

181
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,720
x to the third.

182
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,080
So it's going to be 2 pi
times the antiderivative

183
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,290
of x to the third.

184
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,940
Well that's x to
the fourth over 4.

185
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,490
   

186
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,280
Evaluate it at 1 minus
evaluate it at 0.

187
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,630
Well that equals 2 pi times
1 to the fourth is 1, so

188
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,220
1/4 and then minus 0.

189
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,690
So it's 2 pi times 1/4.

190
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,140
So that's pi over 2.

191
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,770
   

192
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,990
That's the volume, and we just
rotated it around the y-axis.

193
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,360
I will see you in
the next video.

194
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,000
