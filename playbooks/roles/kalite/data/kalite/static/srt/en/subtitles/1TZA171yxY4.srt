1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,350
So far, we've learned a little
bit about determining electron

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,210
configurations.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,590
Let's see if we can use that
information to group elements

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,440
on the periodic table and then
guess as to what they might do

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,130
when they react with
other elements.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,890
So let's just figure out the
electron configurations of a

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,680
couple of elements just for
a little bit of practice.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,920
So, lithium, right there.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,630
What does it look like?

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,970
Lithium's electron
configuration.

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,670
You get the first
shell, is 1s2.

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,200
Two electrons there.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,840
And then you have 2s1.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,270
And sometimes, just to be quick,
to get the notation, is

15
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,280
you can imagine lithium's
electron configuration is the

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,970
exact same thing as helium's
electron configuration-- this

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,070
is helium's electron
configuration-- plus the 2s1.

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,940
This could have also been
written as-- do that in light

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,690
blue-- could also have been
written as helium, 2s1.

20
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,810
Which essentially means that
lithium's electron

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,330
configuration is exactly what
you would have written for

22
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,360
helium's electron configuration,
and then you'd

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,390
have written 2s1.

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,960
You could do that a
bunch of times.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,720
Let's say if we wanted to
figure out the electron

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,980
configuration of iron.

27
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,180
Instead of going through the
whole thing, you know, it's

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,950
1s2, and then it's
2s2, and 2p6.

29
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,360
Instead of doing that whole
thing, you could just say, OK,

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,130
iron has the same electron
configuration.

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,180
So you could say iron's electron
configuration is the

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,375
same thing as argon's electron
configuration.

33
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,140
So I'll just put argon
in brackets.

34
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,750
And then you get 4s2.

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,280
And then you have one, two,
three, four, five, six.

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,750
So d6.

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,630
And we learned that when you're
in the d subshell, or

38
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,740
when you're in the d-block of
the periodic table, you are

39
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,350
actually backfilling
the previous shell.

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,830
So when we're in the fourth
period, in the d-block, we're

41
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,850
backfilling the third shell.

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,930
So 3d6.

43
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,870
And someone had asked-- and
this is an interesting

44
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,740
question-- why does
it do that?

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,230
Why does it not just continue?

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,890
Why doesn't it fill the
fourth d shell?

47
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,790
And the way I think about it--
and this is all intuition, and

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,510
things at the atomic level
really start to become, on

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,880
some levels, non-intuitive-- but
the way I think about is

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,090
as the atom grows larger and
larger, there are more spaces

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,510
between the previous orbitals.

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,560
For example, this is just
how I visualize it.

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,430
If my first shell
looks like this.

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,260
Let's say the s looks
like this.

55
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,440
And then, if I just cut it out,
let's say the p's look

56
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,690
like something like this.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,810
This is maybe the
second shell.

58
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,060
The p's look like this.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,210
And then the next place an
electron might want to be

60
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,150
might be in the third
shell, right?

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,900
So the third shell would
be like this.

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,970
And then you fill out
the third p shell.

63
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,290
This is just an intuition.

64
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,830
This isn't exactly what an
electron would look like.

65
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,540
Maybe the third p shell would
look something like that.

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,470
Look something like that.

67
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,910
And then look something
like that.

68
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,020
And then you're in
the fourth shell.

69
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,520
So you're doing the
fourth shell.

70
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,650
The s subshell might look
something like that.

71
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,230
And then instead of immediately
starting the next

72
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,310
p shell, you're in
the d-block now.

73
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,830
So this is-- let me just
write some labels-- 4s.

74
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,920
This is 3s.

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,020
This is 3p.

76
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,500
This is 2p.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,930
This is 2s.

78
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,650
And then 1s is inside of 2s.

79
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,980
So you don't have to worry
about that too much.

80
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,390
But my intuition behind why the
d orbital gets backfilled

81
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,350
is because now, as the atom gets
larger and larger, you

82
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,830
have these spaces in between
the previous orbital.

83
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:18,790
So now, after filling the 4s
subshell, or the 4s orbital--

84
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,690
so this is 4s here-- out here,
we go back and we fill in the

85
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,960
3d orbital.

86
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,980
So we're going back and
we're filling these

87
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,450
spaces right here.

88
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,580
So this is a lower energy
state than this.

89
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,730
It takes more energy to cram an
electron back into the 3d

90
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,530
shell, back there.

91
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,180
But then once you do that, now
you're ready to then go to the

92
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,120
4p shell, which might look
something like this.

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,610
So an electron would rather go
to another shell, which is the

94
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,870
fourth shell, rather than
backfill the 3d shells.

95
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,950
But once it fills out the fourth
shell, it fills in

96
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,915
those spaces in between.

97
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:02,690
And as the electron gets bigger
and bigger, there's

98
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,260
more and more spaces
in between.

99
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,940
So eventually, when the electron
gets big enough,

100
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,860
there's going to be spaces
between the d shells, and

101
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,930
that's where the d orbitals
and that's where the f

102
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,990
orbitals will go.

103
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,610
That's my intuition behind
its working.

104
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,740
And obviously, when we're
dealing at the atomic scale,

105
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,050
as far as I'm concerned, that's
the best that I can do.

106
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,670
But fair enough.

107
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,220
That's not what I want to do
here, but that was a good

108
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,580
question, as to why do you go
and backfill the third shell

109
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,290
when we're in the
fourth period?

110
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:29,750
Fair enough.

111
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,500
This is an easy way to write
iron's electron configuration.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,710
The reason why I'm doing all of
this is to figure out how

113
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,890
many electrons you have in
the outermost shell.

114
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,630
In the case of lithium, you
have one electron in your

115
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,680
outermost shell, right?

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,860
This is your outermost
shell right here.

117
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,490
You have one electron.

118
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,740
And you could have done the
same thing right there.

119
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,580
In the case of iron, how
many electrons in

120
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,000
the outermost shell?

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,950
Remember, the outermost shell
is the period you're in.

122
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,570
And this is the outermost
shell.

123
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,260
So even though these are higher
energy electrons-- it

124
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,550
took more energy to backfill
those into the lower energy

125
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,630
shell-- it's these that are on
the outside energy shell, the

126
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,670
fourth shell, that are
going to be the

127
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,450
ones that are reacting.

128
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,220
And how many are there?

129
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,590
There are two.

130
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,920
And this is an important
thing.

131
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,410
So there's two here.

132
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,710
There's two on the outside
shell here.

133
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,940
And actually, there's going to
be two for any of these in

134
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,610
pink right here.

135
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,880
Any of the ones in the d-block,
what happens?

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,730
You fill whatever period
you're in.

137
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,310
Let's say that you're
in period five here.

138
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,670
Right?

139
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,850
You're going to have 5s1.

140
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,240
5s2.

141
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,050
And then you're going to go back
and you're going to fill

142
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,490
the 4d shell.

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,190
Right?

144
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,240
But in terms of how many
electrons you have on the

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,200
outside shell, in this case the
fifth shell, you are going

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,660
to have two electrons.

147
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,060
So all of these are going to
have two electrons in their

148
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,310
outermost shell.

149
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,832
In the case of these, the
outermost electrons are going

150
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,750
to be 4s2, right?

151
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,210
Because then you go back and
fill the 3d, but the outer

152
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,000
ones are 4s2.

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,640
So this one also has
two electrons in

154
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,930
its outermost shell.

155
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,540
How many does this group have?

156
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,940
And I've just used a word that
I don't know if I've defined

157
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,030
before, but the group are the
columns in the periodic table.

158
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,590
And as you can see, they all
have patterns to them.

159
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,990
Everything in this first group
has one electron in its

160
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,770
outermost shell.

161
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,090
If you don't believe me,
look at hydrogen.

162
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,510
Hydrogen's electron
configuration is 1s1.

163
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,925
Its outermost shell is 1s.

164
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,620
It has one electron there.

165
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,960
Right?

166
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,190
And that's true for
all of these.

167
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,985
All of these guys have
two electrons in

168
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,480
their outermost shell.

169
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,930
These guys have those
same two electrons.

170
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,780
We can view it that way, in
their outermost shell, but

171
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,530
then they go and backfill
the d shell.

172
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,610
But in terms of their outermost

173
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,460
shell, only two electrons.

174
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,620
Than once you fill the d-block,
or you go backfill,

175
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,670
in the case of the fourth
period, you go and backfill

176
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,570
the third d sub-orbital.

177
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,660
Then you go back to filling
the fourth shell again.

178
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,860
Now the p block, right?

179
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,540
So this one's going to
have three electrons

180
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,010
in its outside orbital.

181
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,060
Or you could say three
valence electrons.

182
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,710
This is four, five, six,
seven, and eight.

183
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,620
Let me do one more, just in
case you don't believe me.

184
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,270
What's the electron
configuration for Sn.

185
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,920
This is, what, selenium? [tin]

186
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,740
I'm not even sure.

187
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,690
But let's say Sn.

188
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,210
What's the electron
configuration?

189
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,620
It's going to have
the same electron

190
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,640
configuration as krypton.

191
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,409
Yes, that element is krypton.

192
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,789
There is such an element.

193
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,070
So it will have the
same electron

194
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,520
configuration as krypton.

195
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,120
So I could have figured
out krypton's electron

196
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
configuration just by going
through the whole periodic

197
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,020
table, but this is just a
faster way of doing it.

198
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,420
Same thing as krypton,
and then it has 5s2.

199
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,940
Then it goes back and backfills
the d-block.

200
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,470
So then there's 10 there.

201
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,130
So 4d10.

202
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,380
And then it starts filling
up the p-block in

203
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,390
the fifth shell again.

204
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,640
So 5p2.

205
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,930
So how many valence electrons
does it have?

206
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,310
Valence electrons,
or electrons in

207
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,440
the outermost shell?

208
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,800
Well, what's the outermost
shell?

209
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,250
It's the fifth shell.

210
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,440
So these and these.

211
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,750
These electrons have a higher
energy state than that.

212
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,960
It took a little bit more energy
to cram them back into

213
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,800
that previous shell than
it took to put

214
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,310
these on the s orbital.

215
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,630
But if you talk about the
electrons that will react, and

216
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,830
that's why I'm emphasizing
these, these are the electrons

217
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,130
that are going to react with
other atoms. Or sometimes with

218
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,840
just other electrons, even.

219
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,460
This one has four outside
electrons.

220
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,920
And you see that right there.

221
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,700
Four outside electrons.

222
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
And since the outside electrons,
for the most part,

223
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,130
are the ones that you're going
to care about, there's a-- I

224
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,750
guess you could say, a notation
where you only draw

225
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,130
the outermost electrons.

226
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,820
So, let's say, for hydrogen, you
could write it like this.

227
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,150
Where you're only drawing the
outermost, valence electrons.

228
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,070
Valence electrons are just
the outermost electrons.

229
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,540
You could write it like that.

230
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,040
You could write it like that.

231
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,150
But this says, hey, I just
have one outside

232
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,980
electron for hydrogen.

233
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,380
If I wanted to draw
it for iron?

234
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,900
Iron, right here?

235
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,520
How would I do that?

236
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,170
I have two electrons in my
outermost shell, so iron I

237
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,890
could just do like this.

238
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,130
And electrons, they
tend to be paired.

239
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,050
So if I have, let's say I wanted
to take the example of,

240
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,810
if this is Sn, this
is selenium.

241
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,270
Let me do carbon.

242
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,840
Carbon, I have four electrons
in my outermost shell.

243
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,470
So carbon I could
write like this.

244
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,750
Or if I didn't want to pair
them, in theory I could write

245
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,220
them like that as well.

246
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,010
And now they're ready to react
with other things.

247
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,800
Now what does this tell me
about, you know, this one has

248
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,410
one electron in its
outermost shell.

249
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,390
These blue, these noble gases--
and we'll talk a

250
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,690
little bit about them in a
second-- have eight electrons

251
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,380
in the outermost shell.

252
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,560
How does that help me when I'm
actually trying to figure out

253
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,200
how things react?

254
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,730
Well, it turns out that all
atoms want to have eight

255
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,200
electrons in their
outermost shell.

256
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,660
And that number is important.

257
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,000
Eight.

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
They want to have eight
electrons in

259
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,870
their outermost shell.

260
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,230
This is the most stable
configuration for atoms. Or I

261
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,050
guess you could say, to some
degree, a better energy state

262
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,980
for the atom.

263
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,260
And why is it the
number eight?

264
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,020
Well, that's something
to think about.

265
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,980
This is another fundamental
number that

266
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,380
just pops out of nature.

267
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,610
And I've thought a little
bit about it.

268
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,400
It must be something about the
atoms in the outermost shell,

269
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,760
when you have eight, they
resonate well with each other.

270
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,270
And they somehow don't get
in the way of each other.

271
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,780
Or don't want to push away
from each other.

272
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,950
I don't know the
answer to that.

273
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,280
And frankly, if someone could
really answer the question of

274
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,790
why eight, exactly why eight,
they would make a good career

275
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,140
for themselves in physics
or chemistry.

276
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,580
But through experimentation, it
has been well established

277
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,260
that atoms want to have
eight electrons in

278
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,990
their outermost shell.

279
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,010
So the question is, if you're
dealing with something like,

280
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,030
let's say you're dealing
with potassium.

281
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,410
Right?

282
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:38,140
Potassium has one electron
in its outermost shell.

283
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:46,240
Let's say you have stuff like
chlorine, that has seven

284
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,100
electrons in its outermost
shell.

285
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,970
What do you think's going to
happen if you put some

286
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,850
potassium near some chlorine?

287
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,360
What's going to happen?

288
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,560
Well, what's the easiest
way for the chlorine

289
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,525
to get eight electrons?

290
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,980
Well it has seven in its
outermost shell.

291
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,610
What's the easiest way?

292
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,040
Well, it'll want to gain an
electron really, really badly.

293
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,290
And what's the easiest way for
potassium to have eight

294
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,670
electrons in its outermost
shell?

295
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,860
Well, if it lost that one
electron, then it will have

296
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,340
eight electrons in its outermost
shell, right?

297
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,450
Its outermost shell won't be
the fourth shell anymore.

298
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,700
It'll be the third shell.

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,950
But it'll have eight electrons
in the third shell.

300
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,820
Its configuration will then look
like argon if it loses

301
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,900
that one electron.

302
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,720
So it'll be a more
stable state.

303
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,690
So if you put sodium in the
presence of chlorine, what's

304
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,650
going to happen?

305
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,020
This electron wants to jump off
of sodium real bad so that

306
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,890
sodium can have eight electrons
in its outermost

307
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,680
shell, or have an electron
configuration like argon.

308
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,410
And that electron is going to
jump to chlorine, and then

309
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,710
chlorine will have eight
electrons in its outermost

310
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,070
shell, and also have
an electron

311
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,970
configuration like argon.

312
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,560
And so, as you can imagine, this
group right here, which

313
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,030
are called the alkali metals.

314
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,600
And we'll talk probably
in the next video why

315
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,230
they're called metals.

316
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,810
This group here,
alkali metals.

317
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,630
And they tend to exclude
hydrogen, and

318
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,110
we'll talk about that.

319
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,140
These really want to give
away electrons.

320
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,620
And because of that, they're
highly, highly reactive,

321
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,050
especially if you put them
in the presence of these

322
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,050
elements, these yellow elements
right here, which are

323
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,510
called the halogens.

324
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,150
These really, really want to
take electrons from other

325
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,440
things, because they just need
one to get to eight.

326
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,750
They usually want to give away
electrons, because they just

327
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,640
have to give away one
to get to eight.

328
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,790
And the reason why hydrogen,
actually, isn't included is

329
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,060
because hydrogen doesn't want
to give away its electron as

330
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,930
bad as these guys.

331
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,920
This rule that your outermost
shell wants to get to eight,

332
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,440
that's true for everything
except for

333
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,790
hydrogen and helium.

334
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,310
Hydrogen and helium, just
because they have one shell,

335
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,330
they're happy with just
two electrons.

336
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,380
And so with hydrogen, sure, it
could lose an electron, but

337
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,860
could just as easily gain an
electron and be happy, because

338
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,540
it'll have a full first shell.

339
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,510
But all of these other ones,
these alkali metals, they want

340
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,430
to give away electrons
really bad.

341
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,100
When people in chemistry talk
about metallic nature, they're

342
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,900
really talking about how
badly something wants

343
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,720
to give away electrons.

344
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,260
Anyway, I'm all out
of time now.

345
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,960
In the next video, we'll
continue discussing the groups

346
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,620
in the periodic tables
and any trends we can

347
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,800
ascertain from them.
