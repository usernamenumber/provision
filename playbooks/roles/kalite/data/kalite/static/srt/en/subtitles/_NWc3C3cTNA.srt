1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the last video where we launched something at an angle, we figured out the horizontal and vertical

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
components of that launch velocity and we used the vertical components to find out how long that thing

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is in the air, and we used that time to figure out how far it traveled given a constant horizontal velocity

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video is redo apart of that problem, to figure out how long that object stays

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the air, and I'm going to do it in a slightly more complected way from what I did in the last video

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it is kind of a more powerful way, and we will see that it is more powerful in future videos

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in last videos to figure out how long something was in the air, we said look,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are starting and stopping at the same elevation, what ever our vertical velocity is here upwards

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are going to have the same magnitude of velocity, but it is going to be downwards

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we used that insight to figure out the change in velocity and we used that change in velocity,

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the constant acceleration due to the force of gravity on an object in free fall,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to figure out the time in the air, and it was pretty simple mathematically.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what we are going to do now is derive a formula, that is useful in Physics, but i always like to

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
derive it from scratch, and that's what I'm going to derive over here, and you have seen me

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
derive this formula before. But just to start off we need to remind our self's of that the vertical velocity

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we calculated in our last video, was 5 m/s and given that vertical velocity lets figure out how

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
long that thing stays in the air.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our vertical velocity, our velocity in the y direction, is 5m/s and also as a reminder

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our convection when we are dealing with conventions in 1 dimension, and this is in one direction now

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
since we know it is in the y direction, is positive is up and negative is down when we are dealing with

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the vertical direction

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when we are dealing the the horizontal direction positive means to the right, negative means to the

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
left, so just to make sure we have those conventions down

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how can we figure out how ling this thing stays in the air, so we can remind our self's that the displacement

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and every thing we are talking about now, this will apply in any one dimension,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The displacement is equal the the average velocity

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times our change in time

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what our average velocity? It is, if we assume constant acceleration,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is our final velocity plus our initial velocity- actually let me write it this way, it will make it a little bit cleaner-

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is our initial velocity plus our final velocity divided by two

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so literary the arithmetic mean of our initial and final velocity

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are going to times that by change in time

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now what is our final velocity going to be, our final velocity is the same thing as

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your initial velocity, plus your acceleration times how much time has passed by

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this right here is your final velocity, so lets substitute that back into this right over here

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what do we get, we get our initial velocity- so our average velocity is now our initial velocity

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus our final velocity- the final velocity is this over here-so it's our initial velocity plus the acceleration

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the amount of time that passes by all of that divided by 2, and all of this is multiplied by

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the amount of time that passes by. Once again this is our total displacement. so this part right over

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here, I'll do it in magenta, we have 2 Vi's, so that simplifies to 2 Vi's- 2 times our initial velocity's

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this expression over here, simplifies 2 times Vi divided by two, is our initial viscosity and then

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have- well I will just do it all here, then I will multiply it by time after that

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus the acceleration times amount of time that passes by, divided by two, and all of this is multiplied

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by the amount of time that passes by. and this is our total displacement

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are almost done- and if you have to take a physics exam under time presser it's not ridicules

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to not have to re-derive it every time, but I want to emphasize, that you should realize that these formulas

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
come from almost just common basic since principles and you should be able to derive them.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it is good to mesmerize them if you have a time presser exam

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now if we multiply this delta t, you get the total displacement is equal to your initial velocity

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times your change in time plus, your acceleration over two- you have a delta t times a delta t

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember delta just means change in time, triangle just means change in time.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so change in time times change in time is change in time squared.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this expression right here this is in some physics books, or in some classes

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they will just give you this formula, but I wanted to show you that it is derived from very very simple

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
principles, from just displacement is average velocity times change in time, what is average velocity

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what is final velocity, it is just initial velocity plus acceleration times time and you will get this

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
expression right over here. so I did this to figure out much time we are going to spend in the air, so

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how do we do that for this particular problem

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we know our initial velocity, that the launch vertical component, because be are just dealing with

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the verticle component here, and we know our initial velocity, we know the acceleration due to gravity

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in this situation we want to figure out when the displacement is going to be

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is going to be a little bit unintuitive, but hopefully it makes sense, when the displacement is

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to be 0

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because there is going to be 2 times when the displacement is going to be 0.
