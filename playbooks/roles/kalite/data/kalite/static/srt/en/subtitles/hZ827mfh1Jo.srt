1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:11,120
Let's say that I have some set
V that is a subspace in Rn.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,750
And just as a reminder,
what does it mean?

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,960
That's just some set, or some
subset of Rn where if I take

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,680
any two members of that subset--
so let say I take the

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,980
members a and b-- they're both
members my subspace.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,910
By the fact that this is a
subspace, we then know that

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,400
the addition of these two
vectors, or a plus b, is also

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,770
in my subspace.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,655
And this is our closure
under addition.

11
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,630
   

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,180
And by the fact that it's a
subspace, we also know that if

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,010
we multiply any member of our
subspace by a scalar -- so the

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,530
fact that those guys are members
of our subspace -- we

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,340
also know that if I pick one
of them, let's say a, and I

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,500
multiply a by some scalar, that
this is also going to be

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,400
a member of our subspace.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,190
And we sometimes call this
closure under scalar

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,440
multiplication.

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,550
   

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,360
And then a somewhat redundant
statement is that V, well it

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,030
must contain the zero vector.

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,050
And that's true of
all subspaces.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,830
V -- let me write it this
way -- the zero vector

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,355
is a member of V.

26
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:27,590
And it would be the zero vector
with n components here,

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,820
because V is a subspace of Rn.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,350
And why I say that's redundant,
because if I say

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,970
that any multiple of these
vectors is also in V, I could

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,300
just set the scalar
to be equal to 0.

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,450
So this statement kind
of takes the

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,630
statement into account.

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,030
But in a lot of textbooks, they
will always write, oh and

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,080
the zero vector has to
be a member of V.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,430
Although, that's kind of
redundant with the closure

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,020
under scalar multiplication.

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,570
Fair enough.

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,063
Now, let's say that I also have
some transformation T.

39
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:58,120
   

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:07,340
It is a mapping, a function,
from Rn to Rm.

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,340
What I want to understand, in
this video is, I have a

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,140
subspace right here, V.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,600
I want to understand whether
the transformation of the

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,030
subspace -- and what
did we call that?

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:29,020
We called that the image of our
subspace, or our subset,

46
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,840
either way.

47
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,240
The image of V under T.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,890
In the last video, just to kind
of help you visualize it.

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,970
How did that work or -- we
had some subset of Rn

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,830
that looked like this.

51
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,280
It was a triangle that looked
something like that.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,120
And that was in Rn, this was
actually in R2, it was a

53
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,850
triangle that looked something
like that.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,020
And we figured out it's
image under T.

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,280
So we went from R2 to R2.

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,920
and we had our transformation.

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,660
And it ended up looking
something like this.

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,352
If I remember it properly.

59
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:06,475
It ended up looking like a --
gee, I don't remember it

60
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:08,810
fully, but it was like a
triangle that was skewed like

61
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,660
this, rotated.

62
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,670
So it was a -- actually I think
it was more like -- I

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,370
think that's right.

64
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,880
It was rotated a bit clockwise
like that and it was skewed.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,530
But the exact particulars
of that last

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,060
video aren't what matter.

67
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,790
What matters is that you are
able to visualize what an

68
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,630
image under transformation
means.

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,700
It means you take some subset of
R2, all of the vectors that

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,760
define this triangle
right here.

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,650
That's some subset of R2.

72
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,010
You transform all of them, and
then you get some subset in

73
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,260
your codomain.

74
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,300
   

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,560
You could call this the image,
because the transformation of

76
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,150
that triangle, or if we call
this s, it's equal to the

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,810
transformation of s.

78
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,780
Or you could say it's the image
of-- you can just call

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,560
it the set s, but maybe it helps
you to visualize-- call

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,690
it the image of this
triangle under T.

81
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,310
Or maybe even a neater way of
thinking about it is, this

82
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,310
triangle-- that skewed, rotated
triangle-- this one is

83
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,920
the image of this right
triangle under T.

84
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,210
I think that might make
a little bit of

85
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,850
visual sense to you.

86
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,090
And just as a bit of reminder,
in that last video these

87
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,790
triangles, these weren't
subspaces.

88
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,900
And just as you could take
scalar multiples of some of

89
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,220
the vectors that are members of
this triangle, and you'll

90
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,690
find that they're not going
to be in that triangle.

91
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,500
So this wasn't a subspace, this
was just a subset of R2.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,310
All subsets are not subspaces,
but all subspaces are

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,480
definitely subsets.

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,770
Although something can be
a subset of itself.

95
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,600
I don't want to wander
off too much.

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,150
But this just helps
you visualize what

97
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,180
we mean by an image.

98
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:03,500
It means all of the vectors that
are mapped to, from the

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,590
members of your subset.

100
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,670
So I want to know whether
the image of V

101
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,090
under T is a subspace.

102
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:18,170
   

103
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,050
So in order for it to be a
subspace, if I take the

104
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,740
transformation -- let me
find two members of T.

105
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,670
Well clearly if I take the
transformation of any members

106
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,230
of V, I'm getting members
of the image.

107
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,610
Right?

108
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,510
So I can write this.

109
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,520
Clearly the transformation of
a and the transformations of

110
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,230
b, these are both of members
of our images of V under T.

111
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,950
These are both members
of that right there.

112
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:53,180
So my question to you is what
is the transformation of a

113
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,410
plus the transformation of b?

114
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,800
And the way I have written this,
these are two arbitrary

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,660
members of our image
of V under T.

116
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,710
Or maybe I should call
it T of capital V.

117
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,710
These are two arbitrary
members.

118
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,090
So what is this equal to?

119
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,630
Well, we know from our
properties, our definition of

120
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,770
linear transformations, the sum
of the transformations of

121
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,110
two vectors is equal to the
transformation of the sum of

122
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,690
their of vectors.

123
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:24,060
Now, is the transformation
of a plus b, is

124
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,130
this a member of TV?

125
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,310
Is it a member of our image?

126
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,510
Well, a plus b is a member of V,
and the image contains the

127
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,810
transformation of all
of the members of V.

128
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,840
So the image contains the
transformation of this guy.

129
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,600
This guy, a plus b
is a member of V.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,490
So you're taking a
transformation of a member of

131
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,060
V which, by definition, is in
your image of V under T.

132
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,410
So this is definitely true.

133
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,070
Now, let's ask the
next question.

134
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:03,160
If I take a scalar multiple of
some member of my image of V

135
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,540
under T, or my T of capital
V, right there.

136
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,400
If I take the sum scalar,
what is this equal to?

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,510
By definition for linear
transformation, this is the

138
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,680
same thing as a transformation
of the

139
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,910
scalar times the vector.

140
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,030
Now is this going to
be a member of our

141
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,520
image of V under T?

142
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,790
Well we know that ca is
definitely in V, right?

143
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,530
That's from the definition
of a subspace.

144
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,055
This is definitely in V.

145
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,960
And so, if this is in V, the
transformation of this has to

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,620
be in V's image under T.

147
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,910
So this is in -- this is
also a member of V.

148
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,400
And obviously, you can
set this equal to 0.

149
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,830
The zero vector is a member of
V, so any transformation of --

150
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,530
if you just put a 0 here, you'll
get the zero vector.

151
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,920
So the zero vector is definitely
-- I don't care

152
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,970
what this is, if you multiply
it times 0, you are going to

153
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,190
get the zero vector.

154
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,640
So the zero vector
is definitely

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,690
also a member of TV.

156
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:12,250
So we come on the result that
T -- the image of V under T,

157
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,700
is a subspace.

158
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Which is a useful result
which we will be able

159
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,370
to use later on.

160
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,670
But this, I guess, might
naturally lead to the

161
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,800
question, what if we go --
everything we have been

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,400
dealing with so far have been
subsets, with the case of this

163
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,659
triangle, or subspaces,
in the case of V.

164
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:42,309
But what if I were to take the
image Rn under T, right?

165
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:48,550
This is the image
of Rn under T.

166
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,350
Let's think about
what this means.

167
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,200
This means, what do we get when
we take any member of Rn,

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,270
what is the set of all
of the vectors?

169
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,610
Then when we take the
transformation of all of the

170
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,340
members of Rn, let
me write this.

171
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,400
This is equal to the set of the
transformation of all of

172
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,750
the x's, where each x
is a member of Rn.

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,240
So you take each of the members
of Rn and transform

174
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,020
them, and you create
this new set.

175
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,910
This is the image
of Rn under T.

176
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,385
   

177
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,490
Well, there's a couple of ways
you can think of this.

178
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,260
Remember when we defined
-- let's see, T is a

179
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,680
mapping from Rn to Rm.

180
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,330
We defined this as the domain.

181
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,715
All of the possible inputs
for our transformation.

182
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:43,450
And we define this
as the codomain.

183
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,900
And remember I told you that
the codomain is essentially

184
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,190
part of the definition of
the function or of the

185
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,110
transformation, and it's the
space that we map to.

186
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,610
It's not necessarily all
of the things that

187
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,670
we're mapping to.

188
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,350
For example, the image of Rn
under transformation, maybe

189
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,320
it's all of Rm or maybe it's
some subset of Rn.

190
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,190
The way you can think about it,
and I touched on this in

191
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,910
that first video, is-- and
they'll never, or at least the

192
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,000
linear algebra books I looked
at, they didn't specify this--

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,070
but you can kind of view
this as the range of T.

194
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:24,190
These are the actual members
of Rm that T maps to.

195
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,210
That if you take the image of
Rn under T, you are actually

196
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:35,190
finding-- let's say that
Rm looks like that.

197
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,310
Obviously it will go
in every direction.

198
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,780
And let's say that when
you take-- let me

199
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,050
draw Rn right here.

200
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,670
   

201
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,140
And we know that T is a
mapping from Rn to Rm.

202
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,450
But let's say when you take
every element of Rn and you

203
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,140
map them into Rm, let's say
you get some subset of Rm,

204
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,300
let's say you get something
that looks like this.

205
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,682
So let me see if I can
draw this nicely.

206
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:08,270
So you literally map every point
here, and it goes to one

207
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:08,860
of these guys.

208
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,200
Or one of these guys can be
represented as a mapping from

209
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,760
one of these members
right here.

210
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,080
So if you map all of them you
get this subset right here.

211
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:26,040
This subset is, this is
T the image of Rn, the

212
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,580
image of Rn under T.

213
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,460
And in the terminology that
you don't normally see in

214
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,790
linear algebra a lot,
you can also kind of

215
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,830
consider it its range.

216
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,760
The range of T.

217
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,320
Now, this has a special name.

218
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,590
This is called -- and I don't
want you to get confused --

219
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,480
this is called the image of T.

220
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,880
Image of T.

221
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
This might be a little
confusing, image of T.

222
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,480
So this is sometimes written
as just im of T.

223
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,580
Now you are a little confused
here, you are like, before

224
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,010
when we were talking about
subsets, we would call this

225
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,770
the image of R subset under T.

226
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,430
And that is the correct
terminology when you're

227
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,400
dealing with a subset.

228
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,920
But when you take, all of
a sudden, the entire n

229
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,160
dimensional space, and you're
finding that image, we call

230
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,170
that the image of the actual
transformation.

231
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:27,160
So we can also call this set
right here the image of T.

232
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,980
And now what is the
image of T?

233
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,020
Well, we know that we can
write any-- and this is

234
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,990
literally any-- so T is
going from Rn to Rm.

235
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,900
We can write T of x-- we
can write any linear

236
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,530
transformation like this-- as
being equal to some matrix,

237
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:51,690
some m by n matrix
times a vector.

238
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,790
And these vectors obviously
are going to be members of

239
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,810
Rn-- times sum Rn.

240
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,450
And what is this?

241
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,310
So what is the image -- let
me write it in a bunch of

242
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:12,290
different ways -- what is
the image of Rn under T?

243
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,180
So we could write that as T --
let me write it this way.

244
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,780
We could write that as T of Rn,
which is the same thing as

245
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,130
the image of T.

246
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,820
Notice we're not saying under
anything else, because now

247
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,200
were saying the image of the
actual transformation.

248
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,540
Which we could also write
as the image of T.

249
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,850
Well what are these equal to?

250
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,610
This is equal to the set of all
the transformations of x.

251
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,422
Well all the transformations of
x are going to be Ax where

252
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:59,350
x is a member of Rn.

253
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,420
So x is going to be an n-tuple,
where each element

254
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,770
has to be a real number.

255
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,060
So what is this?

256
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,880
So if we write A-- let
me write my matrix A.

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,680
It's just a bunch of column
vectors, a1, a2.

258
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,430
It's going to have n
of these, right?

259
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,000
Because it has n columns.

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,060
And so a times any x is going to
be-- so if I multiply that

261
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,550
times any x that's
a member of Rn.

262
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,340
I multiply x1, x2, all
the way to xn.

263
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,220
We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.

264
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,390
This is equal to x1-- the scalar
x1, times a1, plus x2

265
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:47,900
times a2, all the way
to plus xn times an.

266
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,200
And we're saying we want the
set of all of these sums of

267
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,400
these column vectors, where x
can take on any vector in Rn.

268
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,280
Which means that the elements
of x can take on any real

269
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,730
scalar values.

270
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,010
So the set of all of these is
essentially all of the linear

271
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,480
combinations of the columns
of a, right?

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,380
Because I can set these guys
to be equal to any value.

273
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,040
So what is that equal to?

274
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,400
That is equal to, and we
touched on this, or we

275
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,340
actually talked about this when
we introduced the idea.

276
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:30,670
This is equal to the
column space of A.

277
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,570
Or we just denoted it
sometimes as C of A.

278
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,520
So that's a pretty
neat result.

279
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,080
If you take -- it's almost
obvious, I mean it's just I'm

280
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,950
playing with words a little
bit-- but any linear

281
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,530
transformation can be
represented as a

282
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,520
matrix vector product.

283
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,040
And so the image of any linear
transformation, which means

284
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,460
the subset of its codomain,
when you map all of the

285
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,280
elements of its domain into
its codomain, this is the

286
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,530
image of your transformation.

287
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:09,900
This is equivalent to the column
space of the matrix

288
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,110
that you're transformation
could be represented as.

289
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,620
And the column space, of course,
is the span of all the

290
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,790
column vectors of your matrix.

291
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,880
This is just all of the linear
combinations, or the span, of

292
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,860
all of your column vectors,
which we do right here.

293
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,132
Anyway hope you found that a
little interesting, and you

294
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:35,710
will be able to use these
results in the future.

295
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,316
