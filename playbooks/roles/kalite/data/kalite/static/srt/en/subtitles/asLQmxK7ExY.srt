[Intro Music]

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:08,702
We're in the National Gallery of London, and we're looking at one of great Caravaggios.

3
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:13,977
This is the Supper at Emmaus. It dates to about 1605, and it's a large painting.

4
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:14,875
It is large.

5
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,858
And it's horizontal, and figures are actually life-size,

6
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:23,575
so that there's a real sense of art proximity are at presence at this table.

7
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,076
There's even a space for us.

8
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:28,424
And the story is that the Christ has been crucified,

9
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:33,509
and his disciples are walking along the road, a man joins them,

10
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,832
and when they all sit down for a dinner....

11
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:41,482
This third man breaks the bread, and at that moment is revealed to be the resurrected Christ

12
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,932
And we're seeing the reactions of those two disciples.

13
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:51,275
The moment when they recognize him. We have a split second in time, and this high drama.

14
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:54,388
The disciple on the left, in the tattered green shirt or jacket

15
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,855
looks into the table, sitted at the table as we are

16
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:01,442
so his reaction is our reaction as we look to Christ.

17
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:05,526
I love this gesture that he makes of this figure in the left corner

18
00:01:05,526 --> 00:01:08,977
He's so taken back, he's frightened, he's moving his chair,

19
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:13,061
like "Holy Cow!" interested and frightened at the same time.

20
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:16,514
That's right drawn back and drawn in, simultaneously.

21
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:20,408
And in fact the entire painting draws forward and back, simultaneously.

22
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:26,808
Our eyes go into Christ, and in fact both of the Apostles frame our vision as we move towards that centre.

23
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:30,897
In other words, the whole painting is kind of a triangle of vision that moves into Christ's face.

24
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,854
At the same moment, all of the their hands, or I should say,

25
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:39,573
The left hand of the Apostle on the right, and Christ's right hand both move out towards us,

26
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:43,044
literally embracing us and inviting us visually into the image.

27
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:45,288
Well, I mean he couldn't be trying to do that more

28
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:47,673
It's not just in the hands, it's everywhere.

29
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:52,705
I mean, look at that basket of fruit in the front, that hangs off the table

30
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:59,642
Caravaggio was trying to make this painting burst into our space in every possible way he can

31
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:03,793
to make it immediate, and real, and emotional for us.

32
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:10,287
I want to join that table. And of course there's all of the complexity of the emotions of the figures,

33
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:13,475
which of course, is the majority of the painting and the painting's purpose.

34
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:17,155
But then there's a tremendous amount of attention that has been paid to the still life.

35
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,283
Look at the chicken, it looks good.

36
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:21,753
It does. The bread the fruit...

37
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:23,523
I would mind having the fruit, it's all beautiful.

38
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,758
It's that physicality that we expect of Caravaggio.

39
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:31,111
Well, look at, for instance, at the specificity of the joinery in the furniture.

40
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:35,870
If you look at the chair on the left, the very technique, its construction is revealed to us

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,068
everything in this painting is revealed and opened up to us.

42
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:41,945
And yet, the painting is also incredibly focused.

43
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:46,834
Where are we? We're in a kind of a shallow space. It's quite dark.

44
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:52,377
And he's really attending to our focus, making sure that our eyes go only where he wants it.

45
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:58,657
Well, he puts that light there. Sharp light, almost theatrical light on the left side of Christ's face.

46
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:03,804
And what I'm also struck by, is this thing we always see with Caravaggio, the ordinariness of the figures.

47
00:03:03,804 --> 00:03:06,494
The Apostle on the right looks like he has a little bit of a cold.

48
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:08,543
His nose is a little red.

49
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:13,245
The Apostle on the left has a little tear on his clothing. They're poor.

50
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:14,855
That's what the Apostles were.

51
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:17,472
It's a rough and tumble world. And they're not in a church; they're in an inn.

52
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:23,094
So we have an inn keeper. And quite a plain furniture, quite a plain place setting.

53
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:28,570
This is not the pomp and ceremony that we might see Christ when he's represented in a church-like setting.

54
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:32,868
As is also so typical of Baroquen and so perfectly represented here,

55
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:37,072
that moment when the divine entres the everyday world.

56
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:41,356
making the miraculous, the spiritual, immediate in our modern world.

57
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:45,866
And so immidiately, physically, realistically in our space present.

58
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:50,215
That was such a goal of the counter reformation, of the moment in which this painting was made.

59
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:53,840
Confirming and reaffirming and strenghtening our faith.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 99:59:59,999
