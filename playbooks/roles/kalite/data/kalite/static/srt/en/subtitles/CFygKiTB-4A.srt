1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,690
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:05,950
We will now do a momentum
problem in two dimensions.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,170
So let's see what
we have here.

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,070
So we have this ball A and we
could maybe even think of it

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,470
as maybe what's going on on the
surface of a pool table.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,730
We have ball A and it's moving
with its 10 kilograms. So

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,070
these numbers are the
mass of the balls.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,300
This is a 10 kilogram ball and
it's moving to the right at 3

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,710
meters per second.

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,720
And then it hits this ball, B,
which is a 5 kilogram ball.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,920
And then we know that ball A,
ball A kind of ricochets off

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,740
of ball B and gets set onto
this new trajectory.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,010
Now, instead of going due right,
it's going at a 30

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,250
degree angle to, I guess we
could say, horizontal.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,610
It's going in a 30 degree angle
at 2 meters per second.

17
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,650
And the question is, what is
the velocity of ball B?

18
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,840
So velocity is both magnitude
and direction.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,970
So we need to figure
out essentially,

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,190
what is ball B doing?

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,190
Ball B is going to be going--
We can just think about it.

22
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,130
If you ever played pool, we
could guess that ball B is

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,055
going to go roughly
in that direction.

24
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,990
But we need to figure out
exactly what the angle is and

25
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,410
exactly what its velocity is.

26
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,910
So let's do this problem.

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,600
So at first you're saying, oh,
Sal, this looks confusing.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,900
You know, I know momentum
should be

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,880
conserved and all that.

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,590
But now we have these vectors
and there's two dimensions and

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,570
how do I do that?

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,540
And the key here is that there's
just really one more

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,710
step when you're working on it
in two dimensions or really

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,240
three dimensions or an
arbitrary number of

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,340
dimensions.

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,770
When we did one dimension, you
made sure that momentum was

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,590
conserved in that
one dimension.

38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,070
So when you do two dimensions,
what you do is you figure out

39
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,800
the initial momentum in each
of the dimensions.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,270
So you break it up into the
x and y components.

41
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,710
And then you say the final
momentum of both objects are

42
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,680
going to equal the initial x
momentum and are going to

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,570
equal the initial y momentum.

44
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,980
So let's figure out the
initial x momentum.

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,230
So P for momentum.

46
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,180
   

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,390
Because the m is for mass.

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,660
So let's say the initial
momentum in the x direction--

49
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,730
And we don't have to write
initial or final because

50
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,080
really, the total momentum in
the x direction is always

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,729
going to be the same.

52
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,400
So let's say what the initial--
Actually, let me

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,130
write initial just so it hits
the point home that initial

54
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,630
and final don't change.

55
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,260
So the initial momentum
in the x direction.

56
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,600
So i for initial, x-- I should
do something better than keep

57
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,780
writing these subscripts
--is equal to what?

58
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,770
Well ball B has no
initial velocity,

59
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,280
so it has no momentum.

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,600
Ball A is 10 kilograms.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,660
And what is its velocity
in the x direction?

62
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,590
Well all of its velocity
is in the x direction.

63
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,980
So it's 3.

64
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,550
I mean, this is only moving
in the x direction.

65
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,580
So the momentum in the x
direction is 30 kilogram

66
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,350
meters per second.

67
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,120
Mass times velocity, kilogram
meters per second.

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,710
And what's the initial momentum
in the y direction?

69
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,880
   

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,420
Well B isn't moving at
all, so it has no

71
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,480
momentum in any direction.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,390
And A, all of A's movement
is in the x direction.

73
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,980
It's not moving at an angle
or up at all, so it has no

74
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,630
momentum in the y direction.

75
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,030
So we immediately know that
after the collision, the

76
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,590
combined momentum of both of
these balls in the x direction

77
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,670
has to be 30, and the combined
momentum of both of these

78
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,040
balls in the y direction
has to be 0.

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,580
So let's figure out what A's
momentum in the x and y

80
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,840
directions are.

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,080
So to figure out what A's
momentum is, we just have to

82
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,040
figure out what A's velocity in
the x and y directions are

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,720
and then multiply that
times the mass.

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,240
Because mass doesn't
have any direction.

85
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,400
So let's figure out the x and y
components of this velocity.

86
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,860
Let's do the x component
of the vector first.

87
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,610
So the x is just this vector.

88
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,720
   

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,450
Change colors to keep
things interesting.

90
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,230
The y is this vector.

91
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,710
   

92
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,490
That is the y component.

93
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,140
And so, what are those?

94
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,090
And this hopefully, is going to
be almost second nature to

95
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,810
you if you've been watching
all of the other videos on

96
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,880
Newton's laws.

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,620
This is just our trigonometry
and we can write out our

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,160
SOH-CAH-TOA again.

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,260
And I reassure you, this is
the hardest part of any of

100
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,019
these multi-dimensional trig
problems-- Multi-dimensional

101
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,500
physics problems, which really
are just trig problems.

102
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,870
So if we want to figure out
the x component, so the

103
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,880
velocity of A in the
x direction,

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,740
what is it equal to?

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,240
Well this is adjacent
to the angle.

106
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,830
We know the hypotenuse.

107
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:43,592
So we know VA sub x or the
velocity of A in the x

108
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:47,470
direction over the hypotenuse,
over 2 meters per second, is

109
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,770
equal to what?

110
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,520
Adjacent over hypotenuse.

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,620
Cosine.

112
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,880
Is equal to cosine
of 30 degrees.

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,720
Or the velocity of A in the x
direction is equal to 2 cosine

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,420
of 30 degrees.

115
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,300
What's cosine of 30 degrees?

116
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
It's square root of 3 over 2.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,580
This is square root
of 3 over 2.

118
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,600
And square root of 3 over
2 times 2 is equal to

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,120
square root of 3.

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,650
So this is equal to the square
root of 3 meters per second.

121
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,045
And what is the velocity of
A in the y direction?

122
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,100
Well hopefully, this second
nature to you as well.

123
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,260
But since opposite over
hypotenuse is equal to the

124
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,730
sine of 30.

125
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:42,370
So VA in the y direction is
equal to 2 times the sine of

126
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,605
30 degrees.

127
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:46,730
The sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

128
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,330
So this is 1/2.

129
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,360
1/2 times 2 is equal to
1 meter per second.

130
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,490
So after the collision,
A is moving at 1

131
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,950
meter per second up.

132
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,100
One meter per second in
the upwards direction.

133
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,100
And it's moving at square root
of 3 meters per second in the

134
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,830
rightwards direction.

135
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,350
So what is going to be A's
momentum in each of the

136
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,280
directions?

137
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,810
Well, we figured out its
velocity, so we just multiply

138
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,160
each of the velocities
times the mass.

139
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,920
So A has a mass of 10 kilograms.
And this is going

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,720
to be the final momentum.

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,430
Momentum of A in the x direction
is going to equal

142
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,630
square root of 2 times 10.

143
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,330
Square root of 3 is the
velocity, 10 is the mass.

144
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,350
So it's 10 square roots of 3
kilogram meters per second.

145
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,640
And the momentum of A in the y
direction is going to be-- and

146
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,450
since it's going up, we'll say
its positive --it's 1 meters

147
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,210
per second is the velocity
times the mass.

148
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,860
So 10 times 1 is 10 kilogram
meter per second.

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,730
So now let's figure out B.

150
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,950
Let's do the y direction first
because they add up to 0.

151
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,720
I'm going to switch colors.

152
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,230
We know that the momentum
of-- and this

153
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,995
is after the collision.

154
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:12,840
The momentum of A in the y
direction plus momentum of B

155
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,780
in the y direction have
to equal what?

156
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,150
What was the initial momentum
in the y direction?

157
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,450
Right, it was 0.

158
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,040
There was no movement in the
y direction initially.

159
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,940
We know the momentum of
A in the y direction.

160
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,760
It's 10.

161
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,790
10 kilogram meters per second
plus the momentum of B in the

162
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,040
y direction is equal to 0.

163
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,050
So solving for this, just
subtract 10 from both sides.

164
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,080
So the momentum of B in the
y direction is equal to 10

165
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,360
kilogram meters per second.

166
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,430
   

167
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,700
You know the units.

168
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,900
So if its momentum is 10 in the
y direction, what is its

169
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,140
velocity in the y direction?

170
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,810
Well, momentum is equal to
mass times velocity.

171
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,520
So we know that 5 times the
velocity in the y direction--

172
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,660
that's its mass --is
equal to 10.

173
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,410
10 is its momentum.

174
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,970
So the velocity of the y
direction of B must be 2

175
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,570
meters per second.

176
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,350
So there we go.

177
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,160
We figured out B's velocity.

178
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,110
And so let's say this is B's
velocity vector in the y

179
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,740
direction is-- And this is
a minus because this is

180
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,935
equal to minus 10.

181
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:30,380
So it's going down.

182
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,740
It was a velocity of positive
1 going up and then the

183
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,380
minuses carry through and this
is a velocity of minus 2

184
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,059
meters per second for B
in the y direction.

185
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,340
So now let's figure
out the velocity

186
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,808
of B in the x direction.

187
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,540
And I'm running out of space
and it's getting messy.

188
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,860
But we just have to remember
that the momentum of B in

189
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,480
the-- The momentum of A in the
x direction, which is 10

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:02,810
square root of 3, plus momentum
of B in the x

191
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,770
direction has to equal what?

192
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,090
It has to equal the initial
momentum in the x direction,

193
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,240
which is 30.

194
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,590
So to figure out the momentum
of B in the x direction, we

195
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,010
just subtract 10 square
root of 3 from 30.

196
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,760
And let's do that.

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,010
So let's figure out 3 square
root times 10 equals.

198
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,630
And then subtract
that from 30.

199
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,300
And we get let's
just say 12.7.

200
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,380
So we know that the momentum
of B in the x direction is

201
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,420
equal to 12.7, 12.7 kilogram
meters per second.

202
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,680
And we know the momentum, so we
just divide by the mass and

203
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,030
we get its velocity in
the x direction.

204
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,950
So 12.7 divided by 5.

205
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,630
So velocity of B in
the x direction is

206
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,970
12.7 divided by 5.

207
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:04,460
12.7 divided by 5 is equal to
2.54 meters per second.

208
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,020
So its velocity in the
x direction is

209
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,080
2.54 meters per second.

210
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,250
So it's going faster
in both directions.

211
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,970
I'm not going to figure out the
angle here because I've

212
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,650
actually run out of time.

213
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,070
But if you were to add these
two vectors, you'd get an

214
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,340
angle something like this.

215
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,700
And you could figure out the
angle by taking the arc tan.

216
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,080
Well, I won't go into the--
that's a complexity right now.

217
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,050
Actually, I'll do that in the
next video just so I won't

218
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,620
leave you hanging.

219
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,660
But we know what the x and y
components of B's velocity is.

220
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,380
See you in the next video.
