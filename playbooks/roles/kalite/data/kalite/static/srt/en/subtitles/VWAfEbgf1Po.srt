1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
On a multiple choice test,
problem 1 has 4 choices, and

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,490
problem 2 has 3 choices.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,910
That should be choices.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,770
Each problem has only
one correct answer.

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,830
What is the probability of
randomly guessing the correct

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,700
answer on both problems?

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,100
Now, the probability of guessing
the correct answer on

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,685
each problem-- these are
independent events.

10
00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:23,830
So let's write this down.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:34,380
The probability of correct
on problem number 1 is

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,160
independent.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,300
Or let me write it this way.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,090
Probability of correct on number
1 and probability of

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:49,136
correct on number 2, on problem
2, are independent.

16
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:53,510
   

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,650
Which means that the outcome
of one of the events, of

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,650
guessing on the first problem,
isn't going to affect the

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,950
probability of guessing
correctly

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,129
on the second problem.

21
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,250
Independent events.

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,800
So the probability of guessing
on both of them-- so that

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:22,030
means that the probability of
being correct-- on guessing

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,320
correct on 1 and number 2 is
going to be equal to the

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,270
product of these
probabilities.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,480
And we're going to see why that
is visually in a second.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,620
But it's going to be the
probability of correct on

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:43,990
number 1 times the probability
of being correct on number 2.

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,310
Now, what are each of
these probabilities?

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,170
On number 1, there are 4
choices, there are 4 possible

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,620
outcomes, and only one of them
is going to be correct.

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,040
Each one only has one
correct answer.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640
So the probability of being
correct on problem 1 is 1/4.

34
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,480
And then the probability of
being correct on problem

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,010
number 2-- problem number 2 has
three choices, so there's

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,960
three possible outcomes.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,810
And there's only one correct
one, so only

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,949
one of them are correct.

39
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,920
So probability of correct
on number 2 is 1/3.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,370
Probability of guessing correct
on number 1 is 1/4.

41
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,020
The probability of doing on both
of them is going to be

42
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,010
its product.

43
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,450
So it's going to be equal to
1/4 times 1/3 is 1/12.

44
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,305
Now, to see kind of visually
why this make sense, let's

45
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:31,370
draw a little chart here.

46
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,850
And we did a similar thing for
when we thought about rolling

47
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,780
two separate dice.

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,330
So let's think about
problem number 1.

49
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,750
Problem number 1 has
4 choices, only

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,480
one of which is correct.

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,950
So let's write-- so
it has 4 choices.

52
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,810
So it has 1-- let's write
incorrect choice 1, incorrect

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,120
choice 2, incorrect choice 3,
and then it has the correct

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,480
choice over there.

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,620
So those are the 4 choices.

56
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
They're not going to necessarily
be in that order

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,740
on the exam, but we can just
list them in this order.

58
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:10,160
Now problem number 2
has 3 choices, only

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,900
one of which is correct.

60
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,700
So problem number 2 has
incorrect choice 1, incorrect

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,850
choice 2, and then let's say the
third choice is correct.

62
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,800
It's not necessarily in that
order, but we know it has 2

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,760
incorrect and 1 correct
choices.

64
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,970
Now, what are all of the
different possible outcomes?

65
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,550
We can draw a little
bit of a grid here.

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,570
   

67
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,550
All of these possible
outcomes.

68
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,220
Let's draw all of
the outcomes.

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,630
Each of these cells or each of
these boxes in a grid are a

70
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,900
possible outcome.

71
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,290
You could-- you're
just guessing.

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,350
You're randomly choosing one
of these 4, you're randomly

73
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,850
choosing one of these 4.

74
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,000
So you might get incorrect
choice 1 and incorrect choice

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,690
1-- incorrect choice in problem
number 1 and then

76
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,020
incorrect choice in
problem number 2.

77
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,870
That would be that
cell right there.

78
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,150
Maybe you get this-- maybe you
get problem number 1 correct,

79
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,650
but you get incorrect choice
number 2 in problem number 2.

80
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,880
So these would represent all of
the possible outcomes when

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
you guess on each problem.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,700
And which of these outcomes
represent

83
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,570
getting correct on both?

84
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,800
Well, getting correct on both
is only this one, correct on

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,190
choice 1 and correct on choice--
on problem number 2.

86
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,430
And so that's one of the
possible outcomes and how many

87
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,510
total outcomes are there?

88
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,930
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, out of 12

89
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,870
possible outcomes.

90
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,960
Or since these are independent
events, you can multiply.

91
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,910
You see that they're 12 outcomes
because there's 12

92
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,170
possible outcomes.

93
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,340
So there's 4 possible outcomes
for problem number 1, times

94
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,050
the 3 possible outcomes for
problem number 2, and that's

95
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,330
also where you get a 12.

96
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,200
