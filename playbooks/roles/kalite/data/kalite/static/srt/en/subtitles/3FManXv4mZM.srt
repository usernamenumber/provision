00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,990
Quadrilateral ABCD they're telling us it is a rhombus

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,620
To prove that the area of this rhombus is equal to one half times x AC x BD,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,400
essentially proving that the area of a rhombus is one half

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,900
times the product of the lengths of its diagonals

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,650
Let' s see what we can do over here

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,780
There's a bunch of things we know about rhombi

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,130
All rhombi are parallelograms and there's tons of things that

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,100
we know about parallelograms

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,630
First of all, if it's a rhombus, we know that

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,850
all of the sides are congruent

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,980
That side length is equal to that side length, is equal to

12
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,300
that side length, is equal to that side length

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,820
Because it's a parallelogram, we know that

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,530
the diagonals bisect each other

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,370
Let's call this point over here E

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,400
We know that BE is going to be equal to ED and

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:58,170
we know that AE is equal to EC

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,960
We also know because this is a rhombus and we proved this

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,550
in the last video: that the diagonals,

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,540
not only do they bisect each other, but they're also perpendicular

21
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,530
So we know that this is a right angle

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,920
This is a right angle

23
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,090
That is a right angle and then this is a right angle

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,520
The easiest way to think about it is, if we can show that

25
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,010
this triangle ADC is congruent to triangle ABC and

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,650
if we can figure out the area of one of them, we can just double it

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,570
The first part is pretty straightforward

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:39,210
We know that triangle ADC is going to be congruent to triangle ABC

29
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,020
and we know that by side-side-side congruency

30
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,390
This side is congruent to that side

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
This side is congruent to that side and

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,010
they both share AC right over here

33
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,260
So, this is by side-side-side

34
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:05,050
Because of that, we know that the area of ABCD is just going to be

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:13,070
equal to 2 times the area of, we can pick either one of these, ABC

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,970
Let me write it this way

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:27,120
The area of ABCD is equal to the area of ADC plus the area of ABC

38
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,480
but since they're congruent, these 2 are going to be the same thing

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,890
so it's just going to be 2 times the area of ABC

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,490
Now what is the area of ABC

41
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,640
The area of a triangle is just one half of base times height

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:52,250
The area of ABC is just equal to times the base of that triangle

43
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,240
times its height

44
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,740
What is the length of the base

45
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,650
The length of the base is AC

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,750
I'll color code it

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,420
The base is AC and then what is the height here

48
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,170
We know that this diagonal line over here is a perpendicular bisector

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,720
so the height is just the distance from BE

50
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,840
So, it's AC times BE, that is the height

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,790
This is an altitude

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,200
It intersects this base at a 90 degree angle

53
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,100
Or we can say BE is the same thing as times BD

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:42,340
This is equal to times AC, that's our base

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,040
Our height is BE, which is times BD

56
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:56,170
So that's the area of just ABC, that broader,

57
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,520
larger triangle right up there

58
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,690
That half of the rhombus

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,520
We just said that the area of the whole thing is 2 times that

60
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,710
If we go back, if we use both this information and

61
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,270
this information right over here

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,520
We have the area of ABCD is going to be equal to

63
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,630
2 times the area of ABC, this thing right over here

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,640
It is 2 times the area of ABC, right over there

65
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,430
So times is , times AC times BD

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Then you see where this is going

67
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,860
2 times is , times AC times BD

68
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,740
Fairly straightforward, there's a neat result

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,810
Actually, I haven't done this in a video

70
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,850
I'll do it in the next video

71
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,380
There are other ways of finding the areas of parallelograms

72
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,170
Generally, it's essentially, base times height

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,750
But for rhombus, we could do that because it is a parallelogram,

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,300
but we also have this other neat little result

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,440
that we proved in this video

76
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,300
And if we know that lengths of the diagonals,

77
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,680
the area of the rhombus is times the products of the lengths

78
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,850
of the diagonals, which is kind of a neat result
