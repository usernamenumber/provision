00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,773
Several videos ago I had a figure that looked something like this, I believe it was a pentagon or a hexagon.

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:07,185
and what we had to do is figure out the sum of the in particular exterior angles of the hexagon so that

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:19,909
this angle equaled A, this angle B, C, D and E. The way that we did it the last time we said, well A

4
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:25,606
is going to be 180 degrees, minus the interior angle that is supplementary to A, and then we did that

5
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:30,199
for each of the angles and then we figured out, we were able to algebraically manipulate it, we were

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,374
able to figure out what the sum of the interior angles were, using... dividing it up into triangles and

7
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:39,646
then use that to figure out the exterior angle. So it was a bit of an involved process. But I want to show

8
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,965
you in this video that there's actually a pretty simple and elegant way to figure out the sum of these

9
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:50,105
particular external angles, exterior angles I should say, of this polygon, and it actually works for

10
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:59,438
any convex polygon (if you're picking these particular exterior angles I should say) and so the way to

11
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:08,047
think about it is you can just redraw the angles. So lets just draw each of them, so let me draw this

12
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:13,196
angle right over here, we'll call it angle A or the measure of this angle's A, either way let me draw

13
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:19,352
right over here. So this going to be a convex angle right over here

14
00:01:19,352 --> 00:01:24,931
it's going to have a measure of A, now let me draw angle B, angle B, and i going to draw

15
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,308
adjacent to angle A, and what you could do is just to think about it

16
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:33,914
maybe if we draw a line over here, if we draw a line over here that is parallel to this line

17
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:39,970
then the measure over here would also be B,because this is obviously a straight line,

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,766
it would be like transversal, this of course a responding angles, so if u want to draw

19
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:50,636
adjacent angle, the adjacent to A, do it like that, or whatever angle this is the measure of B

20
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:55,382
and now it is adjacent to A, now let's draw the same thing to C

21
00:01:55,382 --> 00:02:00,277
We can draw a parallel line to that right over here. And this angle would also be C

22
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:05,180
and if we want it to be adjacent to that, we could draw it there, so that angle is C

23
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:12,773
C would look something like this, like that then we can move on to D, once again

24
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:20,512
we do it in different color, you could do D, right over here or you could shift it over here

25
00:02:20,512 --> 00:02:23,237
it'll look like that, or shift over here, it'll look like that

26
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:27,702
If we just kept thinking of parallel, if all of this line were parallel to each other

27
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:37,253
So, let's just draw D like this, so this line is going to parallel to that line

28
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:45,442
Finally, you have E, and again u can draw a line that is parallel to this

29
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:49,521
right over here and this right over here would be angle E

30
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:54,194
or you could draw right over here, right over here

31
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:57,844
And when you see it drawn this way, it's clear that when you add up, the

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:04,379
measure, this angle A,B,C,D and E going all the way around the circle, either way

33
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,760
it could be going clockwise or it could be counter clockwise but it will going all the way

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,027
around the circle.

35
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:23,049
And some of this angle, A+B+C+D+E is just going to be 360 degree

36
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:30,422
And this is work for any convex polygon, and when I say convex polygon I mean it is not that dented words

37
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:37,020
Just to be clear what I'm talking about, it would work for any convex polygon that is kind of

38
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,655
I don't want to say regular, regular means it has the same size and angle,

39
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:48,909
but it is not dented, this is a convex polygon. This right here is a concave polygon

40
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:56,515
Let me draw this, right this way, so this would be a concave polygon

41
00:03:56,515 --> 00:04:04,252
Let me draw as it having the same number of side, So i just going to dent this two sides

42
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:11,505
right very here. Is it right? Let me do the same number sides, So i do that, that, that, that

43
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:17,178
and then that's the same side over there, Let me do that and then like that.

44
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:25,974
This has 1,2,3,4,5,6, sides and this has 1,2,3,4,5,6 sides. This is concave, sorry

45
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:36,443
this is a convex polygon, this is concave polygon, All you have to remember is kind of cave in words

46
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:45,245
And so, what we just did is applied to any exterior angle of any convex polygon. I

47
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:57,267
Am a bit confused. This applied to any convex polygon and once again if you take this angle

48
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:05,432
and added to this angle and added to this angle, this angle, that angle and that angle and I'm not applying that all

49
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:09,435
It's going to be the same and I just drew it in that way I could show u

50
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,842
that they are different angles, i could say that one green, and that one some other colour

51
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:12,842
they can all be different but if you shift the angle like this you can see that

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they just go round the circle. So, once again, I'll just add up to 360 degrees
