1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,820
Find the probability
of flipping exactly

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,900
two heads on 3 coins.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,340
So to figure out this
probability, a good place to

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,430
start is just to think about all
of the different possible

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,180
ways that we can flip 3 coins.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,370
So we could get all tails.

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,770
Tails, tails, tails.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,020
We could get tails,
tails, heads.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,280
We could get tails,
heads, tails.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,760
We could get tails,
heads, heads.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,340
We could get heads,
tails, tails.

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,960
We could get heads,
tails, heads.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,900
We could get heads,
heads, tails.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,730
And then we could
get all heads.

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,850
We could get all heads
over here.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,380
So there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8 possible outcomes.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,000
8 possible outcomes.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,960
Now how many of the
outcomes involve

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,180
flipping exactly 2 heads?

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,260
Let's see, that's all tails.

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,300
That's 1 head, 1 head.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,920
This has 2 heads right there.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,670
That's 1 head.

25
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,210
This is 2 heads right
over there.

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,840
Then this is 2 heads
right over here.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,270
And then this is 3 heads,
so that doesn't count.

28
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:30,010
So there are 3 outcomes
with exactly 2 heads.

29
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,490
So, let me spell
heads properly.

30
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,730
2 heads.

31
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:44,690
So the probability of flipping
exactly 2 heads-- And the word

32
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,410
exactly is important, because
if you didn't say exactly,

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,895
then maybe 3 heads, when you
flip 2 heads, so we have to

34
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:50,920
say exactly 2 heads.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,090
So you don't include
the situation

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,220
where you get 3 heads.

37
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,330
So the probability of flipping
exactly 2 heads is equal to

38
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,700
the 3 outcomes with 2 heads
divided by the 8 possible

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,670
outcomes, or 3/8.

40
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,340
So it is equal to 3/8.

41
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,470
And we are done.
