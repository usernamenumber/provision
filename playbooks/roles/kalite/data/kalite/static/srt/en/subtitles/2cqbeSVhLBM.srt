1
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:09,176
On August 5th, 1857,

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:14,842
a 4,300 km long cable was laid across the Atlantic Ocean,

3
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:17,639
it provided a link between Britain and the Americas,

4
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:21,731
further strengthening their social and economic alliances.

5
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,685
Now information could be represented

6
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,276
as a pattern of electrical pulses,

7
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,900
and sent across the world almost instantaneously.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,991
Stock tickers, and money transfers,

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,265
these were commercial applications invented by Western Union

10
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,455
which ushered in a new era of global communication.

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,332
Please stand by for this announcement.

12
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,603
Germany has invaded Poland.

13
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:45,364
And it has bombed many towns.

14
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:48,725
General mobilization has been ordered in Britain and France.

15
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:56,196
And consequently this country is at war with Germany.

16
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,513
Throughout the world, which is the real cause of the war

17
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:03,636
that today threatens the freedom of mankind.

18
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:11,032
(Italian words)

19
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:17,573
(Japanese words)

20
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:20,289
The Japanese has attacked Pearl Harbor Hawaii by air.

21
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,790
President Roosevelt has just announced.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,660
(German words)

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,129
During World War II, Germany, Italy, and Japan

24
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,245
were far outnumbered by the allies.

25
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:33,171
Their only conceivable path to victory

26
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:37,329
was the ability to launch widespread surprise attacks.

27
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,185
So the goal of encryption technology

28
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,435
was to automate the one time pad

29
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,770
using an encryption machine.

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,021
Ideally, this machine would accept an input letter,

31
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:50,670
apply a random shift, and output the encrypted letter.

32
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:55,520
However, all machine follow the same principle.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,478
They begin in some initial configuration known as a state.

34
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,934
They accept some input. They do an operation with the input,

35
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,831
and then they produce an output.

36
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:11,473
The operation from the initial state to final state

37
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:15,084
is always predictable, and repeatable.

38
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,359
So the goal was to produce identical machines

39
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,364
that output a scrambled sequence of shifts,

40
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:27,930
which took a long time to repeat.

41
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,484
Therefore Alice and Bob could generate

42
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,695
an identical shift sequence as follows:

43
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,033
First, they need to share identical machines,

44
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,325
and agree on an initial position

45
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,951
which is defined as the key setting.

46
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:46,719
Then, they align their machines to the same position

47
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,080
and finally cycle through the identical operations

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,923
to achieve identical sequences.

49
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,787
Now, the state-of-the-art technology of the time

50
00:02:56,787 --> 00:03:00,892
was called a rotor encryption machine.

51
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,038
We're all familiar with the mechanical process of an odometer,

52
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:09,073
which takes a long time to finally repeat its cycle.

53
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:13,818
Now imagine we scramble the numbers on the wheels of the odometer.

54
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,112
When it ticks forward,

55
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,822
a new shift could be generated

56
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,866
by adding up each number on the rotors.

57
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:24,136
This is the rough idea behind rotor encryption machines.

58
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:27,207
For example, the message "Attack northwest"

59
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:32,621
would be encrypted as follows:

60
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,682
Notice how a new shift is used

61
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:38,051
at each position in the message.

62
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,610
With 3 rotors, each with 26 numbers,

63
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,982
the length of the sequence before repeating is 26x26x26.

64
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,164
This is equivalent to having

65
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:56,115
a list of shifts 17,576 numbers long.

66
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:58,822
Understand that each rotor position

67
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:03,118
is equivalent to a location in the sequence.

68
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:07,137
The initial machine state is known as the key setting,

69
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:10,892
and the collection of all possible key settings

70
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:14,096
defines the key space.

71
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:16,031
This key space increases

72
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:20,056
if the number of ways to initially configure the machine increases.

73
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:23,891
For example, if the rotors can be rearranged,

74
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,322
then the order can be selected in 6 ways.

75
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:33,407
Let's visualize the key space at this point.

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,853
First, we choose from 1 of 6 possible rotor orderings.

77
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:45,036
Then we select an initial position from the rotor sequence.

78
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:50,428
This gives us a key space with over a 100,000 key settings.

79
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:53,407
Remember, every machine configuration

80
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,129
is a point in this space.

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
When we select a key setting,

82
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,635
we're selecting a starting point in this space,

83
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,632
which then determines the rest of the shift sequence.

84
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,349
Give away the key setting,

85
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,851
and you give away the entire sequence.

86
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
The security of rotor machines

87
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,607
depends on both the size of this key space,

88
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,774
and the randomness of the key setting.

89
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,202
During World War II,

90
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:23,865
one of the most important encryption technologies

91
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:28,245
used by the German military was known as the Enigma.

92
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,858
It was an electromechanical rotor machine

93
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:34,223
invented by a German engineer at the end of the World War I.

94
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:37,667
Each rotor wheel had electrical contacts

95
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:42,146
on either side with a maze of wirings within.

96
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:45,815
So at each rotor position, there's an electrical path

97
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:49,484
from every input letter to every output letter.

98
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,932
When the rotor advanced,

99
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:56,731
an entirely new path was defined for each letter.

100
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,524
During the war,

101
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,378
they continually tried to increase the key space of the Enigma,

102
00:06:01,378 --> 00:06:03,982
in order to make it stronger.

103
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:06,082
For example, some changes they made

104
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,700
were to add a fourth rotor wheel,

105
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,918
and increase the number of possible rotors

106
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:13,645
you could put into the machine to 60.

107
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,855
This has the effect of massively increasing the key space.

108
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,300
Near the end of the war,

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,388
the Enigma could be set up in

110
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:23,832
over 150 million million million ways.

111
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:28,476
Guessing the key setting which was used for a given message

112
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:32,836
was about as likely as guessing the outcome of 26 dice rolls.

113
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:35,470
This gave the German confidence that the allies,

114
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,562
even if they have the copy of the Enigma,

115
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,969
could never check all possible key settings.

116
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,570
For two parties to communicate using the Enigma,

117
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,153
it required that they first shared the daily key settings.

118
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:53,592
This allowed them to align their machines to the same position.

119
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:56,927
This protocol changed over and over during the war,

120
00:06:56,927 --> 00:07:00,287
but generally involved distributing key sheets in advance

121
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,281
to all operators.

122
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:06,136
Each day, the operator would cut off the daily settings,

123
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:09,236
and this would tell them the daily configuration of their machine,

124
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:12,716
such as what rotors to use and the order of the rotors.

125
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:16,093
This key setting was then to be destroyed after use.

126
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,554
However one vital step was left to the operator.

127
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:26,227
They were to select a random initial position of each rotor

128
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:28,448
before communication began,

129
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,379
and a very simple mistake was made

130
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,766
by some fatigued operators.

131
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,181
We make this exact same mistake

132
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:37,624
every time we set a bike lock combination,

133
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,834
because we tend to rotate the cylinders

134
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,296
only a few clicks from the initial state,

135
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,247
or we reused a common password.

136
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,837
This destroyed the uniform distribution of the initial rotor position,

137
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,431
and after repeated observations,

138
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,523
it allowed the allies

139
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:59,677
to reverse engineer the rotor wirings completely.

140
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:02,952
The second major error was a design error,

141
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:05,018
not a procedural one.

142
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,528
The Enigma was designed

143
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:10,545
so that an input letter would never encrypt to itself.

144
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:13,261
So given an encrypted letter, such as L,

145
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:16,103
you can now eliminate the possibility that

146
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:18,655
L was the original letter.

147
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:21,376
What they thought was a strength

148
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:26,840
was actually a weakness in design,

149
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,376
and this lead to a code-breaking machine,

150
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,816
initially designed by the Poles,

151
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:34,000
and later improved by the British-American effort.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,694
The Bombe was multiple Enigma rotors chained together,

153
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:41,871
allowing it to rapidly test different key settings.

154
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,857
It took advantage of the fact that

155
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,571
common words were known to be in the original message,

156
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:50,217
such as weather, and these came to be known as crypts.

157
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:52,526
For a given messaging crypt,

158
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:54,034
the Bombe could scan through

159
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,552
all possible rotor positions and orders,

160
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:01,875
in order to find possible key settings in a matter of minutes.

161
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,460
This machine allowed the allies

162
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,119
to read German commands within hours of them being issued.

163
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:09,477
It was a fatal blow to their combat strategy,

164
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,677
as the allies could anticipate their next move.

165
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,910
One fact remains,

166
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,976
this initial attempts at automating the one time pad failed.

167
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,312
If the operators had instead rolled dice

168
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,731
to decide their initial rotor positions,

169
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,316
the starting points in the sequence

170
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,609
could have been uniformly distributed.

171
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,820
This would have prevented

172
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,835
the reverse engineering of the rotor wirings,

173
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,322
and if the Enigma allows the letters to

174
00:09:35,322 --> 00:09:37,000
be encrypted to themselves,

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,940
the Bombe couldn't have taken advantage of crypts,

176
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,873
and this would require the allies to check the entire key space,

177
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:48,630
which was impossible even with the fastest computer.

178
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,085
Repetition reduced the key space.

179
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,427
Otherwise the outcome of World War II

180
00:09:54,427 --> 00:10:00,545
could have been drastically different.
