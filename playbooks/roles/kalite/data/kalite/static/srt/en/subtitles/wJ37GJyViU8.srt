This is a video for the measuring angles model

2
00:00:03,405 --> 00:00:03,905
because clearly at the time I am doing this video there

3
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:08,977
is no video for the measuring angles module.

4
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:12,338
This is a pretty neat module it was made by Omar Izwan

5
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:16,329
who is one of our amazing highschool interns

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:17,908
that we had this past summer the summer of 2011.

7
00:00:17,908 --> 00:00:22,112
What it really is is it makes you measure angles. He made this cool

8
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:25,948
protractor tool here so that you actually use a protractor to measure the angles

9
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:31,155
and so the trick here is you actually measure it the way ypou would measure an angles using

10
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:34,905
any physical protractor. You would want to put the center

11
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:38,845
of the protractor right at the vertex of where the lines intersect

12
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:43,075
(The vertex of the angle). and then youd want to rotate

13
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:48,867
is at zero degrees is at one of these

14
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:56,221
sides so lets do it so this edge right here is right along this line

15
00:00:56,221 --> 00:01:05,669
so let me rotate it. so then I'm gonna rotate a little bit further that looks... one more? That looks

16
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:10,354
about right and then if you look at it this way you can see

17
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:12,829
that the angle and I don't have my pen tool here I'm just using my

18
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:18,556
regular web browser so if you look at the angle here you see that the other line goes to 130 degrees

19
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:29,141
So this angle that we need to measure here is one hundred and 30 degrees let me check my answer

20
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:35,649
Very good I got it right it would be embarrassing if I didn't lets do the next question. I'll do a couple examples like this

21
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,225
so once again , let us put the center of protractor

22
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,428
right at the vertex right over there

23
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:45,642
and lets get this zero degree side to be on

24
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:49,685
one of the sides of the this angle kind of be within the protractor

25
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:54,190
so let me rotate it this way ,its really pretty cool.

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:02,327
so,let see lets do it one more time its too far.

27
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:07,808
its look about right,let the angle right over here it is ,

28
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:14,528
if you look at the other line points to in its 40 degrees

29
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:17,212
please check the answer very good lets do another one .

30
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:24,972
this is fun,alright so lets get our protractor we have already know how to do in a such a way

31
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,463
you can rotate if first so,that the zero degrees is,

32
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,640
wat you have to do rotate its zero degree to its one of the sides

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,281
so, that the angle is still within the protractor so,lets rotate it around

34
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:37,340
so,if we did like that you know how to do it in such a same way

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,387
we should rotate it when you have centre of the protractor at the vertex

36
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:46,109
of the angle so,it will rotate little bit more so,

37
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:53,333
this is zero degree is this line as we go further further opposite side i guess

38
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,230
since ,this is on side if it is a other line gets us to 150 degree.

39
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,638
lets do one more now i want to show you what not to do so,

40
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:10,389
what not to do is we could put the center right over there

41
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:19,891
let me put,let me make the zero above right over this side

42
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:27,188
right over here,if you did that notice,

43
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:30,753
your angle will not be within the protractor so you want to be measure

44
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:36,928
your tempting to do this measure these outer angle how we used it is an angle but does not the angle

45
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:38,380
with this question is asking is to measure

46
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,343
this is a arc over here telling us does the angle that we measures that arc has to be within the

47
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:47,826
protractor so,lets rotates this protractor little bit more

48
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:50,138
i have already did it,and so,

49
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:58,117
this looks like zero degrees and this right over here is 60 degrees.

50
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:02,117
we got the right answer
