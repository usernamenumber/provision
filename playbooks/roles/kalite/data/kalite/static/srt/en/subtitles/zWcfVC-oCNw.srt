00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,267
In this video I want to do a bunch of example problems that show up on standardized exams

2
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:10,200
and definitely will help you with our divisibility module because it's asking questions like this

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
all numbers, and this is just one of the examples,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,067
all numbers divisible by both 12 and 20 are also divisible by

5
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:22,467
and the trick here is to realize that if a number is both divisible by 12 and 20

6
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:27,191
it has to be divisible by each of these guy's prime factors

7
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,443
So let's take their prime factorization.

8
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:33,019
The prime factorization of 12 is 2 time 6

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:36,333
6 isn't prime yet, so 6 is 2 times 3,

10
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,361
So that is prime

11
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:42,600
so any number divisible by 12 needs to be divisible by 2 times 2 times 3

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,867
So it's prime factorization needs to have a 2 times a 2 times a 3 in it

13
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:49,467
any number that's divisible by 12

14
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:53,359
Now, any number that's divisible by 20, needs to be divisible by

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,448
Let's take it's prime factorization

16
00:00:56,448 --> 00:01:00,133
2 times 10, 10 is 2 times 5

17
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:06,933
so any number divisible by 20, needs to also be divisible by 2 times 2 times 5

18
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:12,702
or another way of thinking about it, it needs to have two 2's, and a 5 in it's prime factorization

19
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:17,694
Now if you're divisible by both, you need to have two 2's, a 3, and a 5.

20
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:23,067
two 2's and a 3 for 12, and then two 2's and a 5 for 20

21
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,867
and you can verify this for yourself if this is divisible by both

22
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:34,800
Obviously, if you divide it by 20, is the same thing as dividing it by 2 times 2 times 5

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
So you're going to have, the 2's are going to cancel out, the 5's are going to cancel out

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,133
your just going to have a 3 leftover, so it's clearly divisible by 20

25
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:50,333
and if you were to divide it by 12, you'd divide it by 2 times 2 times 3

26
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,867
this is the same thing as 12

27
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,200
and so these guys would cancel out, and you would just have a 5 leftover

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,120
so it's clearly divisible by both, and this number right here is 60

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,067
it's 4 times 3, which is 12, times 5. It's 60

30
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:06,933
This right here is actually the least common multiple of 12 and 20

31
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:11,286
Now this isn't the only number divisible by 12 and 20

32
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:14,267
You could multiply this number here by a whole bunch

33
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:19,333
of other factors I could call them a, b, and c.

34
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:25,000
But this is kinda the smallest number thats divisible by 12 and 20

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,283
any larger number will also be divisible by the same things as this smaller number

36
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:31,933
Now, with that said, lets answer the questions.

37
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:35,733
All numbers divisible by 12 and 20 are also divisible by,

38
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,867
Well we don't know what these numbers are,

39
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,933
So we can't really address it,

40
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,355
They might just be ones, or they might not exist

41
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:44,867
because the number might be sixty, it might be a hundred twenty

42
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:50,467
Who knows what this number is? So the only numbers that we know can be divided in to this number

43
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:54,267
well we know two can be, We know that two is a legitimate answer.

44
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:57,533
Two is obviously divisible in 2 times 2 times 3 times 5

45
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:01,067
We know that 2 times 2 is divisible into it.

46
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,733
we have the 2 times 2 over there.

47
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,400
We know that 3 is divisible into it.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,933
We know that 2 times 3 is divisible into it.

49
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,200
so that's six

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,534
We know that 2 times 2 times 3 is divisible into it

51
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:19,467
I could go through every combination of these numbers right here

52
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:23,523
We know that 3 times 5 is divisible into it

53
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:26,067
We know that 2 times 3 times 5 is divisible into it

54
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:28,867
So, in general you can look at these prime factors,

55
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:31,952
and any combination of these prime factors is divisible into

56
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:36,201
any number that's divisible by both 12 and 20

57
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,067
So if this was a multiple choice question

58
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:49,133
and the choices were 7, and 9 and 12 and 8

59
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,333
You would say

60
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,933
7 is not of these prime factors over here,

61
00:03:52,933 --> 00:04:00,467
9 is 3 times 3 so I'd need to have two threes over here, so nine doesn't work

62
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,267
7 doesn't work, 9 doesn't work,

63
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,733
12 is 4 times 3, or another way to divide it,

64
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,871
12 is 2 times 2 times 3

65
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:12,067
Well there is a 2 times 2 times 3 in this prime factorization

66
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:16,534
of this LCM of these two numbers

67
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:19,367
So this is a 12. So a 12 would work

68
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:23,616
8 is 2 times 2 times 2, you would need three 2's in the prime factorization

69
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:28,200
we don't have three twos, so this doesn't work.

70
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:36,016
Let's try another example, just so that we understand this fairly well

71
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,067
So let's say we want to know, we'll ask the same question

72
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:43,600
All numbers divisible by 9 and 24 are also divisible by

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:05:10,000
and once again we just do the prime factorization

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,067
We essentially think of the least common multiple

75
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,421
of 9 and 24

76
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,600
We take the prime factorization of 9

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,933
is 3 times 3

78
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,067
and we're done

79
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:23,800
prime factorization fo 24 is 2 times 12

80
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,133
12 is 2 times 6

81
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:29,467
6 is 2 times 3

82
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:34,158
So anything divisible by 9 has to have a 9 in it's factorization

83
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:37,333
or it's prime factorization would have be a 3 times 3

84
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,600
anything divisible by 24 has to have three 2's in it

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,200
So it's gotta have a 2 times 2 times 2

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,900
and it's gotta have at least one three and we already have a three from the nine

87
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,826
So we have that, so this number right here is divisible by both

88
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:57,933
9 and 24. This number right here is actually 72.

89
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:01,533
This is 8 times 9 which is 72

90
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:04,067
So for the choices for this question

91
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,533
Let's assume that it was multiple choice

92
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:19,600
Let's say the choices here were 16, 27, 5, 11, and 9

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,899
So 16 if you were to do it's prime factorization

94
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,400
is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, its 2 to the fourth power

95
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,162
So you would need 4 two's here, we don't have 4 2's here

96
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,902
I mean there could some other numbers, but we don't know what they are

97
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:38,245
These are the only numbers that we can assume are the prime factorization

98
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:42,133
of something divisible by both 9 and 24

99
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,267
So we can rule out 16 because we don't have four 2's in it

100
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:50,067
27 is equal to 3 times 3 times 3.

101
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:54,244
We don't have three 3's, we only have two of them

102
00:06:54,244 --> 00:06:57,067
So once again, cancel that out

103
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:01,333
5, 5's a prime number, no 5 here, so rule that out

104
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,668
11, once again prime number, no eleven's here, rule that out

105
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:09,600
9 is equal to 3 times 3

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,667
And I just realized that's a silly answer

107
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,329
because all numbers divisible by 9 and 24 are divisible

108
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:14,910
by 9

109
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,580
So obviously 9 is gonna work but I shouldn't have made that a choice

110
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,267
Because that's in the problem

111
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:22,154
But 9 would work. And what also would work is if

112
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:26,333
8 was one of the choices, because 8 is equal to

113
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:31,744
2 times 2 times 2, and we have a 2 times 2 times 2 here

114
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:36,067
4 would also have worked. That's 2 times 2

115
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:39,067
6 would work. Because that's 2 times 3

116
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:42,820
18 would work. Because that's 2 times 3 times 3

117
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,489
So anything that's made up of a combination of these prime factors

118
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:49,667
will be divisible into something that's divisible by

119
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,829
both 9 and 24

120
00:07:51,829 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.
