1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:02,173
So say you just moved from England to the US

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,936
and you've got your old school supplies from England

3
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:05,955
and your new school supplies from the US

4
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:07,503
and it's your first day of school and you get to class

5
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,165
and find that your new American paper doesn't fit in your

6
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:12,155
old English binder.

7
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:14,564
The paper is too wide, and hangs out.

8
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,067
So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper.

9
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,411
And to keep yourself amused during your math class

10
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:21,923
you start playing with them.

11
00:00:21,923 --> 00:00:23,083
And by you, I mean

12
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,001
Arthur H. Stone in 1939.

13
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,791
Anyway, there's lots of cool things

14
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,973
you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes.

15
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:30,380
And more shapes.

16
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,250
Maybe spiral it around snugly like this.

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,070
Maybe make it into a square.

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,123
Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with

19
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:39,000
a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,728
In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip,

21
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,764
and then your hexagon is pretty stable.

22
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:43,799
And you're like, "I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting,

23
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,507
but I guess it has symmetry or something."

24
00:00:46,507 --> 00:00:50,969
Maybe you could kinda fold it

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,520
so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,072
That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles,

27
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:57,673
which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are,

28
00:00:57,673 --> 00:01:01,675
you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class.

29
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,336
And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry,

30
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,326
you decide to try this three-way fold the other way,

31
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:09,226
with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down

32
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,997
when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up.

33
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:15,076
What? You close it back up and undo it.

34
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:16,637
Everything seems the same as before,

35
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,277
the center is not open-uppable.

36
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:20,265
But when you fold it that way again,

37
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,563
it, like, flips inside-out. Weird.

38
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:25,049
This time, instead of going backwards,

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,401
you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again.

40
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,600
And you want to make one that's a little less messy,

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,844
so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely

42
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:34,048
into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide

43
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:36,030
that it would be cool to color the sides,

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,794
so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow.

45
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,575
Now you can flip from yellow side to white side.

46
00:01:39,575 --> 00:01:42,067
Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side

47
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:45,476
Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go?

48
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,743
So you go back, and this time you color the white side green,

49
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,099
and find that your paper has three sides.

50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:51,861
Yellow, white, and green.

51
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,195
Now this thing is definitely cool.

52
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:54,769
Therefore, you need to name it.

53
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,534
And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it

54
00:01:56,534 --> 00:02:00,248
and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is.

55
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,218
That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking

56
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:03,267
about hexaflexagons.

57
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,404
And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class

58
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,281
you pull out your paper strips.

59
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,834
You had made this sort of spirally folded paper

60
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,916
that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper,

61
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,503
and you decide to take that

62
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,511
And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon.

63
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,871
Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier

64
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,115
with the extra paper.

65
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:22,674
And you color the three sides and are like,

66
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,484
Orange, yellow, pink.

67
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:27,846
And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class.

68
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:28,585
Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink.

69
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:31,631
Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second.

70
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,411
Okay, so you color that one green.

71
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,435
And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green.

72
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:37,086
Who knows where the pink side went?

73
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:38,882
Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink.

74
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,762
Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue.

75
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:46,603
Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh.

76
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:49,262
With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way,

77
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:50,719
flappy way up.

78
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,913
But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways.

79
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:55,576
Yes, one goes from pink to blue,

80
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,933
but the other, from pink to orange.

81
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,505
And now, one way goes from orange to yellow,

82
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:04,146
but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow.

83
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:05,779
During lunch you want to show this off

84
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,916
to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman.

85
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:11,656
You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon,

86
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:13,658
which you call the trihexaflexagon.

87
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:15,191
And he's like, whoa!

88
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,939
and wants to learn how to make one.

89
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,496
And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip,

90
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:21,271
fold it into equilateral triangles,

91
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:23,118
and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around

92
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,597
into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric.

93
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,832
The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not,

94
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,262
then you're doing it wrong.

95
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,247
And then you just tape the first triangle to the last

96
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,934
along the edge, and you're good.

97
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,145
But Tuckerman doesn't have tape.

98
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,184
After all, it was invented only 10 years ago.

99
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:40,380
So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine,

100
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,137
and then glues the first to the last.

101
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:44,964
Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a

102
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:47,064
flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it

103
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:49,883
flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center.

104
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,929
You decide to start a flexagon commitee together

105
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,105
to explore the mysteries of flexagation.

106
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:57,971
But that will have to wait until next time.
