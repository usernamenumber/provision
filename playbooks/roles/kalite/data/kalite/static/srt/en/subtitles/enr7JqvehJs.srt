1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,130
So far, when I've told you about
the dot and the cross

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,440
products, I've given you the
definition as the magnitude

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,710
times either the cosine
or the sine of the

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,710
angle between them.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,430
But what if you're not given
the vectors visually?

7
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,210
And what if you're not given
the angle between them?

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,240
How do you calculate the dot
and the cross products?

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,160
Well, let me give you
the definition that

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,000
I giving you already.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,710
So let's say I have a
dot b dot product.

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,610
That's the magnitude of a times
the magnitude of b times

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,200
cosine of the angle
between them.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,730
a cross b is equal to the
magnitude of a times the

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,670
magnitude of b times sine of
the angle between them-- so

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,360
the perpendicular projections
of them-- times the normal

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,130
vector that's perpendicular
to both of them.

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,750
The normal unit vector, and you
figure out which of the

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,500
two perpendicular vectors
it is by using

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,620
the right hand rule.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,170
But what if we don't have
the thetas; the

22
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,320
angles between them?

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,760
What if, for example, I were
to tell you that the vector

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,990
a,-- if I were to give it to you
in engineering notation.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,090
In engineering notation,
you're essentially just

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,270
breaking down the vector into
its x, y and z components.

27
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:23,580
So let's say vector a is 5i--
i is just the unit vector in

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,890
the x direction, minus
6j, plus 3k.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,740
   

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,790
i,j and k are just the unit
vectors of the x, y and z

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,310
directions.

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,700
And the 5 is how much it goes
in the x direction.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,400
The minus 6 is how much it
goes in the y direction.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,890
And the 3 is how much it goes
in the z direction.

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,040
You could try to graph it.

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
And actually, I'm trying to look
for a graphing calculator

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,370
that'll do this, so I can show
you it all in videos to give

38
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,360
you more intuition.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,830
But lets say this is
all you're given.

40
00:01:53,830 --> 00:02:00,100
And let's say that b-- I'm just
making these numbers up--

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,170
let's say it's minus 2i-- and,
of course, we're working in

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:14,480
three dimensions right now--
plus 7j, plus 4k.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,300
You could graph it.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,030
But obviously, if you were given
a problem, and if you

45
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,270
were actually trying to model
vectors on a computer

46
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,510
simulation, this is the
way you would do it.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,690
You'd break it up into the x, y,
and z components because of

48
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,780
the add vectors.

49
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,600
You just have to add the
respective components.

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,210
But how do you multiply them
either taking the cross or the

51
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,340
dot product?

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,580
Well it actually turns out I'm
not going to prove it here but

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,400
I'll just show you
how to do it.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,100
The dot product is very
easy when you have it

55
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,330
given in this notation.

56
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,880
And actually another way of
writing this notation,

57
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
sometimes it's in bracket
notation.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,955
Sometimes they would rewrite
this as 5 minus 6, 3.

59
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:49,455
Or it's just the magnitudes of
the x,y and z direction.

60
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,170
I just want to make sure you're
comfortable with all of

61
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,270
these various notations.

62
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,360
You could have written b
as minus is 2, 7, 4.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,380
These are all the same things.

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,360
You shouldn't get daunted if
you see one or the other.

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,430
But anyway, so how do
I take a dot b?

66
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,110
   

67
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,670
This, I think you'll find
fairly pleasant.

68
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,410
All you do is you multiply the
i components, add that to the

69
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,270
j components multiplied, and
then add that to the k

70
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,210
components multiplied
together.

71
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:34,350
So it would be 5 times minus 2
plus minus 6 times 7 plus 3

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:45,260
times 4, so it equals minus
10 minus 42 plus 12.

73
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,020
So this is minus 52 plus 12,
so it equals minus 40.

74
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,460
That's it.

75
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,840
It's just a number.

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,090
And I'd actually be curious
to graph this on a three

77
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,980
dimensional grapher to see
why it's minus 40.

78
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,600
They must be going in
opposite directions.

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,680
And their projections onto each
other go into opposite

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,070
directions.

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,770
And that's why we get
a minus number.

82
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,000
   

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,030
The purpose of this-- I don't
want to get too much into the

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,050
intuition-- this is just how to
calculate, but it's fairly

85
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:15,900
straightforward.

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,930
You just multiply the
x components.

87
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,029
Add that to the y components
multiplied and add that to the

88
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,450
z components multiplied.

89
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,710
So whenever I am given something
in engineering or

90
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,470
bracket notation and I have to
find the dot product, it's

91
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,680
very, almost soothing, and
not so error prone.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,390
But, as you will see, taking the
cross product of these two

93
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,160
vectors when given in this
notation isn't so

94
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,490
straightforward.

95
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,020
And I want you to keep in mind,
another way you could

96
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,590
have done it, you could have
figured out the magnitude of

97
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,470
each of these vectors and then
you could have used some fancy

98
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,770
trigonometry to figure out the
thetas and then used this

99
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,370
definition.

100
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,230
But I think you appreciate the
fact that this is a much

101
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,350
simpler way of doing it.

102
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,140
So the dot product
is a lot of fun.

103
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,570
Now let's see if we could
take the cross product.

104
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,450
And once again, I'm not
going to prove it.

105
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,230
I'm just going to show
you how to do it.

106
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,370
In a future video, I'm sure I'll
get a request to do it

107
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,710
eventually, and I'll prove it.

108
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,270
But the cross product, this
is more involved.

109
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,210
And I never look forward to
taking the cross product of

110
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,290
two vectors in engineering
notation.

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,700
a cross b.

112
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,760
It equals.

113
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,530
So this is an application
of matrices.

114
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,850
So what you do is you take the
determinant-- I'll draw a big

115
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,120
determinant line-- on the top
line of the determinant.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,190
This is really just
a way to make you

117
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,090
memorize how to do it.

118
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,240
It doesn't give you much
intuition, but the intuition

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,690
is given by the actual
definition.

120
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,010
How much of the vectors are
perpendicular to each other.

121
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,050
Multiply those magnitudes.

122
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,210
Right hand rule figures
out what direction

123
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,360
you're pointing in.

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,380
But the way to do it if you're
given engineering notation,

125
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,763
you write the i, j, k unit
vectors the top row.

126
00:05:55,763 --> 00:06:00,080
i, j, k.

127
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,230
Then you write the first vector
in the cross product,

128
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,560
because order matters.

129
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,550
So it's 5 minus 6, 3.

130
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,320
Then you take the second vector
which is b, which is

131
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,970
minus 2, 7, 4.

132
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,880
So you take the determinant
of the 3 by 3 matrix,

133
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,350
and how do I do that?

134
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,930
Well that's equal to the
subdeterminant for i.

135
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,460
So the subdeterminant for i, if
you get rid of this column

136
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,920
and this row, the determinant
that's left over, so that's

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:40,760
minus 6, 3, 7, 4 times i--
you might want to review

138
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,430
determinants if you don't
remember how to do this, but

139
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,770
maybe me working through it
will just jog your memory.

140
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,590
And then remember, it's
plus, minus, plus.

141
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,550
So then minus the subdeterminant
for j.

142
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,500
What's the subdeterminant
for j?

143
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,470
You cross out j's
row and columns.

144
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,065
You have 5, 3, minus 2, 4.

145
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:05,030
   

146
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,650
We just crossed j's
row and column.

147
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,770
And whatever's left over, those
are the numbers in its

148
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,470
subdeterminant.

149
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,420
That's what I call it.

150
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,136
j plus-- I want to do them all
on one line because it would

151
00:07:18,136 --> 00:07:19,870
have been a little bit
neater-- plus the

152
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,840
subdeterminant for k.

153
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,290
Cross out the row and
the column for k.

154
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:35,010
We're left with 5 minus 6,
minus 2 and 7 times k.

155
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,980
And now let's calculate them.

156
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,440
And let me make some
space, because I've

157
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,130
written this too big.

158
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,790
I don't think we need
this anymore.

159
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,460
So what do we get?

160
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,400
Let's take this up here.

161
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,090
So these 2 by 2 determinants
are pretty easy.

162
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:58,690
This is minus 6 times
4 minus 7 times 3.

163
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,180
I always make careless
mistakes here.

164
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:10,770
Minus 24 minus 21 times i minus
5 times 4 is 20, minus

165
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:23,270
minus 2 times 3, so minus minus
6 j, plus 5 times 7, 35

166
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,640
minus minus 2 times minus 6.

167
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,330
So it's minus positive 12k.

168
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,330
We could simplify this, which
equals minus 24 minus 21.

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,830
It is minus 35-- I didn't have
to put a parentheses-- i, and

170
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,720
then what's 20 minus minus 6?

171
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,600
Well that's 20 plus
plus 6, so 26.

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,590
And then we have a
minus out here.

173
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,640
So minus 26j.

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,340
And that was 35 minus
12, that's 23.

175
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,190
Plus 23k.

176
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,690
So that's the cross product.

177
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,150
And if you were to graph this in
three dimensions, you will

178
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,710
see-- and this is what's
interesting-- you will see

179
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:09,410
that vector, if my math is
correct, minus 35i, minus 26j,

180
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:15,750
plus 23k, is perpendicular
to both of these vectors.

181
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,440
I think I'll leave you there for
now, and I will see you in

182
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,050
the next video.

183
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,140
And hopefully, I can track down
a vector graphic program.

184
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,880
Because I think it'll be fun to
both calculate the dot and

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,130
the cross products using the
methods I just showed you and

186
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,840
then to graph them.

187
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,320
And to show that it
really does work.

188
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,930
That this vector really is
perpendicular to both of these

189
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,820
and pointing in the direction as
you would predict using the

190
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,520
right hand rule.

191
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,990
I'll see you in the next video.

192
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,900
