1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,300
I always rush those videos at the end because right when

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,510
I YouTube 10 minute limit,

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,070
but I just want to make sure that you understand what I did.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,340
I used the first few examples-

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,700
and essentially what they told us--

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,680
to figure out an equation that tells me well,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,330
if I know the term t, how do I get the t'th term, right?

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,020
Actually,it works here too.We could write 8 plus 9 t minus 1.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,230
Because here, this is the first term, so this t minus 1 term

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,540
goes to 0, and that's why we only have 8.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,930
And it works on all of these,and it makes sense.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,020
Every term is going to be 9 more than the previous one.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,510
We start at 8, and the reason why it's t minus 1 instead of t

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:54,060
is because we only start adding 9 after the first term.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,590
For example, if this was actually 9, 18, 27,

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,880
if we just went like that,

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,030
we could've just said it's 9 times t, right?

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,050
That could have been the formula.

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,070
Or we could've said 9 plus 9 times t minus 1.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,110
These would have been the same thing. But it started at 8,

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,120
so that's why we had to make it a little bit more cloogy.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,050
Hopefully that explains it a little bit better.

23
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:33,010
Let's do the next problem. Problem six I will do in yellow.

24
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,680
They draw a bunch of lines,so they draw three lines.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,820
One line, two lines, then we have a third line.

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:02:04,130
OK, so this is s degrees, r degrees, t degrees, z degrees,

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,760
y and x degrees.

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,570
Three lines intersect in a point as shown in the figure above

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,450
Which of the following pairs of angle measures

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,400
is not sufficient for determining all six angle measures?

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,890
Is not, so they're going to make us go through all of them.

32
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,370
Hopefully one of the early choices. So choice a, t and z.

33
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,030
So I'm going to do choice a in this brown color.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,550
So choice a, t and z.

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,630
Well first of all, if I know t,

36
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,920
I immediately know z because they're opposite angles, right?

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
So I could figure out that. I could figure out that.

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,170
Well if I know either of those,I could then figure out

39
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,360
let's see, in order to do anything from here,

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,970
I need to know one of the other angles.

41
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,120
And this is actually the way you should think about it.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,870
t and z only gives us the relationship between these two

43
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,850
purple lines, right?

44
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,830
It essentially tells us at what angle these two purple

45
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,890
lines intersect.

46
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,600
But it gives us no information about the angle that

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,010
this yellow line intersects, right?

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,020
Think about it, if I welded these purple lines together,

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,360
I could still move this yellow line around without

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,730
changing t or z.

51
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,750
So there's no way just knowing t or z I can figure out

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
what angle this yellow line is at.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,090
And if you did the other choices, you could try it out.

54
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,030
For example, if I didn't know t and instead they told me r,

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,040
then I would be in business.

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,020
If I knew r, for example, then I could use the fact that s,

57
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,000
r, and z all form one line. And I could figure out s.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
If I knew z,

59
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,000
then I could figure out t because they're opposite

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
If I know r, I could figure out s because they're opposite.

61
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,000
And then if I knew s, I could figure out y, right?

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,510
So z and t alone will not help you, so our choice is a.

63
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,380
And normally on the SAT when they give you something where

64
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,560
you have to kind of try out every choice they give you,

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,580
it's normally going to be one of the first choices because

66
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,050
they try to make the questions as fast as possible.

67
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,500
They don't want you to waste too much time.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,410
If you ever see yourself wasting too much time on a question,

69
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,330
you're not necessarily doing it wrong,

70
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,400
but you may not be doing it the quickest possible way.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
Problem number seven.

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,000
The sum of two numbers that differ by one is t.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,900
So let's call those two numbers x and y.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,060
We know that the sum of x plus y is equal to t.

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,580
But we also know that the numbers differ by 1.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,290
And then they say in terms of t,

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,030
what is the value of the greater of the two numbers.

78
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,010
So let's just assume that x is greater than y.

79
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,030
Let's just write x is greater than y.

80
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,050
So that means that x minus y is going to be equal to what?

81
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,940
Well they told us that the sum of two numbers

82
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,750
that differ by 1.

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,060
So x is actually exactly 1 more than y.

84
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,090
So that when I subtract y from x I get 1.

85
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,390
So if I want to know the value of the greater of the two

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,050
numbers I defined x, actually,

87
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,250
as the greater of the two numbers

88
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,050
I just have to solve the system of equations for x.

89
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,980
So let's add the two equations. x plus x is 2x.

90
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,730
What's y plus negative y? Well, they cancel out, right? 0.

91
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,000
Then what's t plus 1? Well it's t plus 1.

92
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,300
And now to solve for x, you get x is equal to

93
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,240
divide both sides by 2 or multiply by 1/2-- t plus 1 over 2.

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,830
And we are done. And that is choice c. Next problem.

95
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,690
Problem number eight. This color is getting obnoxious.

96
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,930
OK, number of siblings per student in a preschool class.

97
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,720
So let me draw this chart.

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:40,700
So this is number of siblings,number of students.

99
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,000
The table above shows how many students in a class of

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,060
12 preschoolers had 0, 1,2, or 3 siblings.

101
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,000
OK, right, I haven't actually included the information.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,040
0, 1, 2, 3.

103
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,170
So 3 kids had 0 siblings, 6 kids had 1 sibling,

104
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,340
2 kids had 2 siblings, and then 1 kid had 3 siblings.

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,020
Later, a new student joined the class, and the average

106
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,010
number of siblings per student became equal to the median

107
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,000
number of siblings per student.

108
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:28,050
How many siblings did the new student have? Fascinating.

109
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,110
OK, so let's say the new student has x siblings.

110
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,940
x siblings is how many the new student has.

111
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,420
So we don't know where the new student falls in, but let's

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:49,010
figure out where the average and the median are before the

113
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,150
student even joins. So the median number of siblings.

114
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,540
The average number of siblings per student became

115
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,280
equal to the median number of siblings per student.

116
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,000
So what is the average number of siblings per student?

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,560
We just add the number of siblings for all of the students,

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,910
so we should get 12 terms. So we can multiply 3 times 0

119
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,150
that's essentially 0 plus 0 plus 0-- plus 6 times 1,

120
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,790
plus 2 times 2, plus 3 times 1, divided by 12.

121
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,900
This is the current average of siblings per student.

122
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,850
This is 0, so this equals 6 plus 4 plus 3 over 12,

123
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,150
which is what? 10,10,this 13.

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,020
This equals 13/12,which is 1 1/12.

125
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,650
So before this new student joins, there's 1 1/12.

126
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,910
This is the average.

127
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,890
That's before the new student joins.

128
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,410
What's the median?

129
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,090
Let's list out all of the-- let me do it in another color

130
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:11,210
because I'm running out of space-- so I have a 0, 0, 0,

131
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,030
there are three students with 0.

132
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
Then you have 6 students with 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Then you have how many students with 2?

134
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,580
2, 2. And then one student with 3.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So there are 12 terms in all,and what's the middle one?

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the middle term is 6.

137
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,000
So the median before that student joined is 1, right?

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,080
And the average before that student joined

139
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,940
is a little bit over one, it's 1 1/12.

140
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,710
So the only way that you can bring the average down--

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,170
right, because that's essentially what we have to do,

142
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,080
this new student-- to bring this average down,

143
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,000
he either has to have 1 sibling or 0 siblings.
