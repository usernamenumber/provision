1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,980
So we're on problem number one
on the California Standards

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,280
Test Problems for Algebra II.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,260
And so the theory being is if
you're able to do all or at

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,100
least understand all 80 of these
questions, I think you

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,610
have a pretty good understanding
of Algebra II,

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,540
at least from the perspective
of California.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,820
Let's see, problem number one.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,850
What is the complete solution
to the equation the absolute

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:31,920
value of 3 minus 6x
is equal to 15?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,689
So let's think about it.

12
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,880
3 minus 6x could clearly be 15,
because the absolute value

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,600
of 15 is 15.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,620
So we could say that 3
-- sorry that's a 3.

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,490
3 minus 6x could
be equal to 15.

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,430
But 3 minus 6x could also be
equal to minus 15, right?

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,430
Because the absolute value
of minus 15 is also 15.

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,620
So let's write that down.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,270
Or 3 minus 6x is equal
to minus 15, right?

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,640
If this was equal to minus 15,
you'd take the absolute value,

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,590
you'd get positive 15.

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,239
So either of these
could be true.

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,700
So let's solve for x.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,750
Subtract 3 from both sides,
you get minus

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,400
6x is equal to 12.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,980
Divide both sides by minus 6,
you get x is equal to minus 2.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,250
And so here, if we subtract 3
from both sides, you get minus

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,120
6x is equal to minus
15 minus 3.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,920
That's minus 18.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,800
Divide both sides my minus
6, you get x is equal

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
to positive 3, right?

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,990
A negative divided by a negative
, so x is equal to 3.

33
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,240
So x could be minus 2 or
3, and that's choice b.

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,880
   

35
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,790
Problem two.

36
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,630
Let me switch colors to make
things interesting.

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,840
And this is a similar
type of problem.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,820
What are the possible values of
x in the absolute value of

39
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:03,320
12 minus 4x is equal to 2?

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,190
Same logic.

41
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,210
12 minus 4x could be 2, right?

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,530
The absolute value of 2 is 2.

43
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,980
So you you get 12 minus
4x is equal to 2.

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,260
Or 12 minus 4x could
be minus 2, right?

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,570
Because the absolute value
of minus 2 is 2.

46
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:26,420
So then you get 12 minus 4x
could be equal to minus 2.

47
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,590
So this is an or proposition.

48
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,800
So let's see, subtract 12 from
both sides, you get minus 4x.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,626
2 minus 12 is minus 10.

50
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:37,940
Then you get x.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,220
Divide both sides by minus 4
is minus 10 over minus 4.

52
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,980
The negatives cancel out.

53
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,665
And that's equal to 5/2,
or 2 and 1/2, for 2.5.

54
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:54,720
And the only reason I wrote 2.5
is I was looking at the

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,190
choices, and they have
everything as decimals.

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,900
So let's look at the other
possibilities.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,110
Subtract 12 from both sides, you
get minus 4x is equal to

58
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,634
minus 2 minus 12 is minus 14.

59
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:14,670
x is equal to minus
14 over minus 4.

60
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,230
Negatives cancel out, which is
equal to 7/2, which is equal

61
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,810
to 3 and 1/2, which
is equal to 3.5.

62
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,580
So x could be 2.5 or 3.5,
and that is choice d.

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,620
Problem three.

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,140
I'll switch to maybe green.

65
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,120
Problem three.

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,270
For weddings, Sherada bought
several dozen roses and

67
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,720
several dozen carnations.

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,562
The roses cost $15 per dozen,
so roses are $15 per dozen,

69
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,490
the carnations cost $8 per
dozen, so the carnations are

70
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,460
$8 per dozen.

71
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,650
Sherada bought a total of
17 dozen flowers and

72
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,535
paid a total $192.

73
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:03,040
How many roses did she buy?

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,230
All right, so let's set
some variables.

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,080
Let R equal dozens of roses.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,010
   

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,285
I hope you can read
my handwriting.

78
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,940
   

79
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,540
And let C equal to dozens
of carnations.

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,720
   

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,700
All right, so they say
that she bought a

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,600
total of 17 dozen flowers.

83
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,200
So the dozens of roses she
bought plus the dozens of

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,330
carnations she bought must be
equal to 17 because she bought

85
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,060
a total of 17 dozens.

86
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,270
It also tells us that
she spent $192.

87
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,240
So how do we figure out how
much money she spent?

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,420
So if she bought R dozens
of roses, how much did

89
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,320
she spend on roses?

90
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, each dozen of
roses is $15.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,560
So she spent 15 times the
number of dozens.

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
That's how much she
spent on roses.

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,750
How much did she spend
on carnations?

94
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,630
Well, she bought C dozens
of carnations.

95
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,900
Each dozen was $8.

96
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
She spent 8C dollars
on carnations.

97
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,840
So her total amount of money she
spent was the amount she

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,160
spent on roses plus the amount
she spent on carnations, and

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,090
that is equal to 192.

100
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,070
Now, we have two linear
equations and two unknowns.

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,240
We can just solve them.

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
We want to solve for the
number of roses.

103
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,872
That was the question.

104
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:28,790
So let's try to cancel out
the number of carnations.

105
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,770
So if we multiply this top
equation by minus 8, we'll get

106
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,780
a minus 8C.

107
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,570
That'll cancel out with that,
so let's do that.

108
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,250
So let's multiply that top
equation by minus 8.

109
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,550
You get minus 8R minus 8C.

110
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,230
What's minus 8 times 17?

111
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,800
Let's see, 17-- I'll do it in
the corner here-- 17 times 8,

112
00:05:49,800 --> 00:06:00,120
7 times 8 is 56, 1 times 8 is
13, plus 5 is 1, 1 times-- oh,

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,030
my brain was getting
ahead of me.

114
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,460
1 times 8 is 8, plus 5 is 13.

115
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,130
Sorry.

116
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,930
It's equal to 136.

117
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,910
Oh, and we would multiply it by
negative 8, so we'd put a

118
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,900
negative there.

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,100
And now we can add these
two equations.

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,020
15 minus 8, 7R.

121
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,760
8C minus 8C is 0-- and that
was the whole point behind

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
multiplying this top equation
by minus 8-- is equal

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,270
to 192 minus 36.

124
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,940
Let's see.

125
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,680
We can do little borrowing, or
regrouping, they call it now.

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,220
That's 12, that's 8,
so it equals 56.

127
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,220
7R is equal to 56, so
R is equal to 8.

128
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,815
So Sherada bought 8 dozens of
roses, and that is choice C.

129
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:47,130
   

130
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,380
Problem four.

131
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,940
   

132
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,430
What is the solution
to the system of

133
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,070
equations shown below?

134
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,130
And there's three of them with
three variables, always the

135
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,250
hairiest problem.

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,160
Let's see.

137
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:08,990
We have 2x minus y plus
3z is equal to 8.

138
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:18,400
We have x minus 6y minus
z is equal to 0.

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:26,670
And then you get minus 6x plus
3y minus 9z is equal to 24.

140
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,390
Now there's a bunch of
ways to solve these.

141
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,230
You could use matrices and
inverses of matrices and

142
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,010
Gauss-Jordan elimination, or you
can just kind of use your

143
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,140
traditional multiplying
equations by each other and

144
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,240
adding them so that you can kind
of constrain them or take

145
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,920
out variables.

146
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,160
And we'll do the last one
because I don't want to

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,570
introduce any other kind of
matrix manipulation here.

148
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,680
So what I want to do is, let's
use this equation with both of

149
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,300
these, and try to cancel
out the x's, right?

150
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,390
Well, let's think of how
we could do that.

151
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,280
Well, one thing I like to do,
just to simplify it, is to get

152
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,050
all of the equations in what I
consider lowest integer from.

153
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,690
I know that's not
a formal term.

154
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,960
But look at all the terms
in this equation.

155
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,510
They're all divisible
by 3, right?

156
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,340
So let's divide all
of them by 3.

157
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,520
So this last equation would
become-- if you divide

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,720
everything by 3, you'd get minus
2x plus y minus 3z is

159
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,070
equal to 8.

160
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,220
So let's cancel that out.

161
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,350
I just divided it by 3.

162
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,110
It's the same thing.

163
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,880
Remember, whatever you do to
one side of an equation you

164
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,570
can do to the other side
of the equation.

165
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,260
Anyway, so let's use this
equation and this equation and

166
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,320
then this equation and this
equation to get two equations

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,169
with just y's and z's.

168
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,419
So essentially we want to
cancel out the x's.

169
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,710
So to cancel out the x's with
this one and this one, we can

170
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,550
just add them, right?

171
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,670
Because 2x plus minus
2x, that's going to

172
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,320
cancel out the x's.

173
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,210
So we can just do that.

174
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,710
And then when we do it with
this equation, we could

175
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,220
multiply this equation times
minus 2 first and it'll cancel

176
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,520
out the x's there.

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,210
So let's do it.

178
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,990
So let's just write it and
I'll write it in green.

179
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,220
So if I add this equation to
this equation, 2x minus 2x is

180
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:14,230
0x minus y plus y, that's 0y.

181
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,220
These are all zero, but I'm just
writing them down to show

182
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,230
that we're done.

183
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,030
Well, they all cancel out.

184
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,380
Plus 0z.

185
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,030
These are equal to 8 plus
8 is equal to 16.

186
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,060
So you get 0 is equal to 16,
which makes no sense.

187
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,840
So there's actually
no solution here.

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,030
And if you wanted to think
about visually what's

189
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,590
happening is each of these
equations represents a plane

190
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,060
in three dimensions.

191
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,780
And the only way you get no
solution or no intersection

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,070
between this equation and this
equation or this equation,

193
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,000
which are essentially the same
equation, the only reason why

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,730
you can't get the intersection
between them is that they must

195
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,510
be parallel equations.

196
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,680
You could get an infinite number
of solutions if they

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,400
were actually the same plane.

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,630
But these are parallel planes,
so they'll never intersect.

199
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,390
So we saw.

200
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,090
And it kind of makes sense
because this part-- well, I'm

201
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,000
not going to go into
the details.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,270
We're just focused on solving
problems right now.

203
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,410
But it's fair enough to say
that when you add this

204
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,710
equation to this equation to
cancel out the x's, everything

205
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,830
else cancels out and you got
a nonsensical statement, 0

206
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,160
equals 16, so there's no
solution and that's choice c.

207
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,900
And those are parallel planes
in three dimensions.

208
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,360
Problem five.

209
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,770
A restaurant manager bought
20 packages of bagels.

210
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,720
Some packages contained 6
bagels each and the rest

211
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,090
contain 12 bagels each.

212
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,480
There were a 168
bagels in all.

213
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,500
How many packets of 12 bagels
did the manager buy?

214
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,310
   

215
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,090
So he bought some
packages of 6.

216
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,930
So the packages of 6 plus the
packages of 12, that's just my

217
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,700
random notation that
I invented.

218
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,570
He bought a total of 20
packages, so that equals 20,

219
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,860
and he bought a total of
168 bagels in all.

220
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,050
So how many bagels did he
get from the 6-packs?

221
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,520
Well, each of them had
6 bagels, right?

222
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,160
So he got 6 times the
number of packs.

223
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
So he got 6 times this.

224
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,420
This is the number of bagels he
got from the 6-packs, and

225
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,750
then this is the number
bagels he got from

226
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,720
the 12-packs, right?

227
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,500
The number of packs times 12,
and then that is equal to 168.

228
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,680
Two equations, two unknowns.

229
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,670
They're linear equations.

230
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,360
We should be able
to solve this.

231
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,020
So they want to know how
many packages of the 12

232
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,710
bagels did he buy?

233
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,735
So they want to know what p sub
12, or whatever you want

234
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,250
to call that is.

235
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,860
So if we want to do that, let's
cancel out the P6's.

236
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,330
So if we multiply that top
equation by minus 6, you get

237
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:02,695
minus 6 times the 6-packs, minus
6 times the 12-packs--

238
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,540
I'm just multiplying this top
thing by minus 6-- is

239
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,200
equal to minus 120.

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,220
Now, we can add the
two equations.

241
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,130
These cancel out.

242
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,080
That was the whole point.

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,430
12 times the 12-packs minus 6
times the 12-packs, that's

244
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,085
equal to 6 times the 12-packs.

245
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:24,950
It's equal to 168
minus 120 is 48.

246
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,210
And so we get the 12-packs,
there were 48

247
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,810
divided by 6 is 8.

248
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,240
So there were 8 12-packs.

249
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,610
The manager bought 8 12-packs.

250
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,110
That is choice b.

251
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,850
And I'll see you in the
next video because

252
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm all out of time.

253
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,000
