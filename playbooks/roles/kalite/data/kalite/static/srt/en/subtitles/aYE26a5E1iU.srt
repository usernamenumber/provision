1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome to level three exponents.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,200
Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,580
So if I asked you what four to the one / two power is, your immediate

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,650
inclination is to view this probably as like a

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,800
multiplication problem and try to multiply it somehow or add

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,740
them or something.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,420
And you always have to remind yourself this

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,330
is not multiplication.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,720
I know when I first learned it, I always was tempted to do

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,620
something with multiplication.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,810
Well, something to the one / two power might not be intuitive to

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,860
you, but it actually turns out that this means the same thing

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,250
as the square root of four.

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,380
Or another way, what times itself is equal to four,

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,600
and we know that the square root of four is two.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,090
It could actually be a positive two or a negative two because we

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,820
know that either of those numbers when they're

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,520
squared could equal four.

19
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,090
But for the sake of this one we'll assume it's always

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,100
the positive square root.

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,600
So four to the Ã‚Â½ is equal to two.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,500
Similarly, nine to the one / two, well that would be three.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,700
sixteen to the one / two -- oops.

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,260
sixteen to the one / two, my subconscious gave away the answer.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,910
sixteen to the one / two power is four.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,130
twenty-five to the one / two power is five.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,170
I think that might make sense to you now.

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,730
So what does it mean when something is to the one / three power?

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,940
Well, if I say eight to the one / three power, you might

30
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,260
already catch on.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,520
In the one / two power we said something times something

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,180
is equal to four.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,580
Well in the one / three power we have to say that something to the

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,520
third power is equal to eight.

35
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,730
And if you've been practicing your exponents you know that two

36
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:50,050
to the third power is equal to eight.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,060
So we know that eight to the one / three is equal to two.

38
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:02,900
Similarly, twenty-seven to the one / three is equal to three.

39
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,740
And sixty-four to the one / three is equal to four.

40
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,910
You might notice that I'm picking particular numbers,

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,040
like eight and twenty-seven, sixty-four.

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,050
That's because they have clean, cube roots.

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,050
And then by the way, when something is to the one / three power

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,470
that's the same thing as saying the cube root.

45
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,180
I just used terminology without explaining it,

46
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,240
which is very bad.

47
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,900
So I just used eight and twenty-seven and sixty-four because when I raised them to

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,000
the fractional exponents, they actually come out to

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,730
be clean numbers.

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,280
You could use a calculator and do something like five to the one / three

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,700
power and you'll get some weird decimal.

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,670
Let's do some more problems.

53
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:49,210
So we know that nine to the one / two is equal to three.

54
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,930
Well what do you think nine to the two / three is equal to?

55
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,960
Well, it turns out that this is equivalent to nine to the -- oops,

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,570
I actually didn't want to do those -- what do you think nine

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,860
to the three / two is equivalent to?

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,640
Well this is the same thing as nine to the one / two power

59
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,580
to the third power.

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,390
And I'll do a whole presentation on the actual

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,020
principles of exponents, but it actually turns out you

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,800
could just multiply.

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,910
When you have one exponent to another is when you can

64
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,910
multiply the two and that's where you get three / two .

65
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,940
But nine to the one / two we know is three.

66
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,680
And you're raising it to the third power, so that equals twenty-seven.

67
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,730
I'm sure at this point I have confused you.

68
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,050
Let's do more of these.

69
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,360
So you know at this point that sixteen to the one / four power --

70
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,270
think about what that is.

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,490
That means that some number to the fourth power is sixteen.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,030
If you've been practicing your level one exponents, you'll

73
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,810
probably know that well, that equals two, because two times two

74
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,900
times two times two, well that equals sixteen.

75
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,310
So we know that sixteen to the one / four is equal to two.

76
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,730
So what do you think sixteen to the two / four is equal to?

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,270
Well, we already know from that last problem that that's the

78
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:21,700
same thing as sixteen to the one / four squared -- that's the two on both

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,320
sides -- and we know sixteen to the one / four is two, so that equals two

80
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,590
squared and that equals four.

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,780
And it all works out because we know from fractions another way

82
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,190
to write the fraction two / four is to write one / two.

83
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,250
So this is the same thing as sixteen to the one / two power.

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,400
sixteen to the one / two power, well that's just equal to four.

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,780
Now I'm going to mix it up real good and do some negative

86
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,790
fractional exponents.

87
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,670
So what if I were to tell you sixteen to the negative one / two power?

88
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,390
Well this might seem very daunting at first, but as we

89
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,450
know with the negative exponents level three,

90
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,160
immediately we just say well this is the same thing as one

91
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:11,170
over sixteen to the positive one / two.

92
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,910
And that's the same thing as one to the one / two over sixteen to the one / two.

93
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,630
Well the square root of one is easy, it's one.

94
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,120
And sixteen to the one / two is four.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,290
So that wasn't too bad.

96
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,490
It's a little daunting when you see a negative exponent, but

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,630
immediately when you see that negative, just flip the sixteen and

98
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,310
then work it out like a regular fractional exponent problem.

99
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,390
Let's do another one.

100
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:51,950
eight over twenty-seven to the negative one / three.

101
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,660
Immediately when we see that negative, we

102
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,550
want to just flip it.

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:03,430
So we'll say that equals twenty-seven over eight to the one / three, and that

104
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:11,050
equals twenty-seven to the one / three over eight to the one / three.

105
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,860
And we know that twenty-seven to the one / three, well that equals three.

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,720
And eight to the one / three, well that equals two.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,270
So we've got eight over twenty-seven to the negative one / three is three / two.

108
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,160
The first problem probably looked very intimidating to

109
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,270
you, but it only took us two steps to get there and as you

110
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,320
do more practice, hopefully it'll seem more and

111
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,060
more intuitive to you.

112
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,740
Let me give you another problem.

113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,870
What's negative eight to the negative third power?

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,980
Let me change that.

115
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:51,240
What's negative eight to the negative one / three power?

116
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,430
Once again, at first this might confuse you, but when you see

117
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,580
that negative in the exponent, we just take the reciprocal of

118
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,680
the base, so that we say that that is equal to negative one

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,670
over eight to the one / three power.

120
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,640
And we say well that is equal to, we could write it as one

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,760
over negative eight to the one / three.

122
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,260
We say what number times itself three times is equal to negative eight?

123
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,530
Well, we know from intuition there's no real mechanical way

124
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,430
to do this, but we know that negative two times negative two is

125
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,050
four times negative two is negative eight.

126
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,330
So we know that this is equal to one over negative

127
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,940
two or negative one / two.

128
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,160
So negative eight to the negative one / three is

129
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,200
equal to minus one / two.

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,750
Let's do another one, one more problem just to thoroughly

131
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,060
melt your brain.

132
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:03,240
Let's say nine over four to the negative three over two.

133
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,160
Well, immediately we see that negative exponent,

134
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,670
let's flip the base.

135
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:13,240
We get four over nine to the three / two .

136
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:22,500
Well we know that that equals four over nine to the one / two, and all

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,680
of that to the third power.

138
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,090
four over nine to the one / two, I think at this point you know that's the

139
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,470
same thing as four to the one / two which is two over nine to

140
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,390
the one / two which is three.

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,510
Now we have to just raise everything to the third power.

142
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,940
And that's the same thing as two the third power which is

143
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,390
eight divided by three to the third power.

144
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,010
Well that's twenty-seven.

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,460
There we have nine / four to the negative three / two power is

146
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,090
equal to eight over twenty-seven.

147
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,400
Now hopefully you can at least do these problems.

148
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,900
You probably don't have a good intuitive sense for exactly

149
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,640
what a negative three / two power is, and hopefully I can cover that

150
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,570
for you in future modules.

151
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,700
But I think you're ready to try some of the level three

152
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,300
exponent practice problems.

153
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,820
Have fun.
