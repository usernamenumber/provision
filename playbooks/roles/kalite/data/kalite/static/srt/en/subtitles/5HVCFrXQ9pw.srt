1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:09,000
What I want to do in this video is explore how trade imbalances, in theory, should be resolved by freely floating currencies.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So let's just say, that at the beginning of our time period — like we did in the last video 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,020
that the exchange rate between the Chinese Yuan and the US dollar is 10 to 1.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:28,003
So the last time people traded these currencies, they exchanged 10 Yuan for 1 US dollar.

5
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,005
And, when I say "dollar," I'm going to implicitly mean the US dollar.

6
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:35,008
Now, let's think about two entrepreneurs in each of the countries — or one in each of the countries.

7
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:38,005
So let's talk about a Chinese entrepreneur.

8
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,002
So we are in China here, and he makes dolls.

9
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:46,000
He makes dolls. So let me draw one of the dolls.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,994
And in order to profitably sell a doll, he needs to sell them for 10 Yuan.

11
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:03,008
If he's able to sell for the equivalent of 10 Yuan in the United States 

12
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:07,008
and we won't talk a lot about shipping and what currency you'd have to pay it in, and all of that 

13
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:12,001
then he can pay all of his needs — maybe even the shippers across the Pacific 

14
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,005
maybe their employees are also Chinese, so they want their money in Yuan.

15
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:19,001
And obviously, most of the cost would be for manufacturing this doll.

16
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:21,005
And all of his employees want to be paid in Yuan.

17
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:26,005
His own rent for the factory, or even his own rent for his own house, it all has to be paid in Yuan.

18
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:30,001
So this is what he needs to sell his doll for:10 Yuan.

19
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,008
And at the current exchange rate, that would be 1 US dollar.

20
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:38,005
Now, let's go across the Pacific.

21
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,005
Let's go to the United States.

22
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:47,005
And let's say that we have another entrepreneur who is making soda, or making cola, for export.

23
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,003
So let me draw a can of cola.

24
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:58,004
And similarly to this guy in China, he needs to sell his product abroad for the equivalent of a dollar,

25
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:02,009
so that he can cover shipping costs, and the manufacturing costs, and the high fructose corn syrup, and all of that.

26
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:12,004
So needs to sell for 1 US dollar.

27
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:17,001
And once again, he cares about dollars, because he has to pay his own mortgage in dollars 

28
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:21,003
his employees need to be paid in dollars — maybe the shippers he used, they only accept dollars.

29
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:24,128
So this is how both of these characters think about it.

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:32,253
Now at this current exchange rate, let's say that the demand for these dolls

31
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:39,436
that there is demand for 100 dolls in the United States.

32
00:02:39,436 --> 00:02:41,007
This guy is exporting, and so is this guy.

33
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,006
We'll make it very simple.

34
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:45,004
They're only focused on exports.

35
00:02:45,004 --> 00:03:09,009
So at current exchange, (and I'll do it for both), for the doll guy, there is demand for 100 dolls in the United States.

36
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,009
So what does that mean?

37
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:16,001
That means that if he can sell these dolls for 1 dollar — which is equivalent to 10 Yuan 

38
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:21,001
then there are going to be 100 people in some time period — let's say it's a year or a month 

39
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,005
who are going to be willing to buy the dolls at that price.

40
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:31,002
And let's say — also at this current exchange rate — in China, 50 people are willing to buy this cola.

41
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:41,006
So at the current exchange rate, there is demand for 50 cans of cola in China.

42
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:46,009
(Obviously, these are ridiculously low numbers, but we're just dealing with simple numbers to help our thinking.)

43
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:54,310
And let me write the phrase "at current exchange rate" as well.

44
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,431
So what we're saying is that, in China, he needs to get a dollar.

45
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,615
At the exchange rate, that's 10 Yuan.

46
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,683
So if he were to — at a store in China, or to a distributor in China, maybe 

47
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:09,408
sell each of these cans for 10 Yuan, there's demand for 50 cans of cola in China.

48
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,591
Now, what's going to happen here?

49
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:14,333
I think some of you all might already see that a trade imbalance is developing.

50
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,185
So what's going to happen here?

51
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,717
So this guy, he likes doing this — and this guy likes doing it — so what's going to happen?

52
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:32,779
In this time period, this Chinese guy is going to ship over 100 dolls to the United States.

53
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:37,667
So let me write this down. This is China. This is the US over here.

54
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,172
And what's the US going to do?

55
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:46,766
Well, the US is going to ship over — essentially 

56
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,181
Remember, he's selling this in the United States.

57
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:52,014
So each 10 Yuan is 1 dollar.

58
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:54,011
So for each doll, he's going to get 1 dollar.

59
00:04:54,011 --> 00:05:02,510
So he's going to get back 100 dollars for his dolls.

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,940
And then, once he gets back 100 dollars for his dolls, he's going to want to convert them into Yuan.

61
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:25,667
So then he will try to convert the 100 dollars into yuan.

62
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,098
So this is what'll end up happening for this guy.

63
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:33,267
And let's say these are the only two people trading between China and the United States, just to really simplify things.

64
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,504
Now let's think about what happens on the right side over here.

65
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:41,240
This guy is going to ship 50 cola cans to China.

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,838
So we have a cola can right over there — cola.

67
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:50,933
He is going to ship 50 of them to China from the United States.

68
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,569
And what is he going to get back in return?

69
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,934
Well, it's being sold to Chinese distributors, so they're going to pay him in Yuan.

70
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:04,267
So for each can, at the current exchange rate — or at the current price — he's going to get 10 Yuan.

71
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:10,267
So when you convert it back, he's going to get 10 Yuan per can.

72
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:15,333
So 10 Yuan times 50 is 500 Yuan.

73
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:20,900
500 Yuan is what he's going to get.

74
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,470
And then, he's going to try to convert 

75
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,909
Let me write that in a different color, just really for the sake of it.

76
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:43,488
So he's going to try to convert — because he has to pay his expenses in dollars — his 500 Yuan into 

77
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:47,518
Now, what's the exchange rate that he wants to get — his goal?

78
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:50,418
To cover his costs, he has to get 10 to 1.

79
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:55,456
So 500 Yuan into 50 dollars.

80
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,515
And let me make it clear: this guy thinks he's going to get 10 Yuan for every dollar

81
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:03,602
so he wants to convert his 100 dollars into 1,000 Yuan.

82
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,333
So let me write it here: 1,000 Yuan.

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,632
I should have written it over here. 1000 yuan over here.

84
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,065
So what just set up?

85
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:16,533
If these are the only people trading goods and currency in this time period, what did we just set up?

86
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:22,132
Well, clearly, this guy is shipping more value to the US than this guy is shipping to China.

87
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,170
There's a trade imbalance.

88
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:29,144
If you think of it in terms of dollars, this guy is shipping 100 dollars worth of goods to the US,

89
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:32,719
while this guy is only shipping 50 dollars worth of goods to China.

90
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,320
So there's a net trade imbalance of 50 dollars.

91
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,781
China is shipping 50 dollars more to the US then the other way around.

92
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:41,775
If you think about it in Yuan, it would be a trade imbalance of 500 Yuan.

93
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:52,364
And because of that, this guy is trying to convert many more dollars into Yuan than this guy is trying to convert the other way around.

94
00:07:52,364 --> 00:08:06,067
Notice: there is more demand for Yuan than dollars.

95
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:10,057
What's going to happen — especially if these are the only two people trading?

96
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:14,412
If these are the only two people trading, this guy is going to say, "Hey, I've got 10 Yuan."

97
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:15,949
"Let me convert it into dollars."

98
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,467
It'll be just like what we saw in the last video.

99
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,368
And, obviously, there'll be more actors here.

100
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:23,455
But this guy has more stuff to convert than this guy.

101
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,638
In fact, if these were the only two people trading,

102
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,800
he wouldn't even be able to convert all of his currency into Yuan,

103
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,697
because there's only 500 Yuan available on the market.

104
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:35,715
This guy thinks he should get 1,000 Yuan.

105
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,802
And, obviously, if the price of the Yuan goes up, like we've seen in the previous video,

106
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:44,800
maybe there will be more people who want to convert Yuan, maybe fewer people who'd want to convert dollars.

107
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,629
So we can think about all of those.

108
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:51,760
But I really want to think about how this will potentially resolve the trade imbalance.

109
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,933
So we have a situation with more demand for Yuan than dollars.

110
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:02,667
There's a demand for 1,000 Yuan here, but there's only 500 Yuan being sold.

111
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,763
Or you could view it the other way.

112
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:08,810
There's only demand for 50 dollars.

113
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,942
And there's 100 dollars being sold.

114
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,536
Either way there's an imbalance.

115
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,005
So what's going to happen?

116
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:19,694
Well, you're going to have either — depending on how you want to view it

117
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:26,267
you could say that the price of the dollar will go down.

118
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:33,208
Or you could say that the price of the Yuan will go up.

119
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,533
And the dynamics would be like we saw in the last video.

120
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:39,106
This guy over here would sell a couple of his Yuan.

121
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,496
And he'd say, "Wow, there's this guy over there who really wants to buy it."

122
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:50,855
And then maybe he'll keep saying, "Well, you know what, instead of giving me a dollar for every 10 of my Yuan,

123
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,177
why don't you give me a dollar for every 9 of my Yuan?"

124
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,521
Or eventually, "Why don't you give me a dollar for every 8 of my Yuan?"

125
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,771
And so he'll keep raising the price of the Yuan.

126
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:04,183
He'll keep giving fewer and fewer Yuan for each of the dollars.

127
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:06,505
Let's say this goes on for a little bit.

128
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,363
And I really want to explore the trade imbalance.

129
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:11,706
Let's say at some point — and, obviously, maybe more and more people come into the market.

130
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:12,708
So, eventually, it clears.

131
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,004
Because, right now, there isn't enough Yuan for this guy.

132
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,467
But as you can see, the price of the Yuan goes up.

133
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:20,383
So after all of this, because of this trade imbalance,

134
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:26,660
because more people want to convert dollars into Yuan than Yuan into dollars, the currency changes.

135
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,313
So you could imagine — and I'm just going to make up some numbers here — that the Yuan becomes more expensive.

136
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:41,352
It was 10 Yuan to the dollar; now maybe it is 8 Yuan to the dollar.

137
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,875
So this is where we get to eventually.

138
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:50,205
Because of this supply demand imbalance right over here.

139
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,333
8 Yuan to a dollar.

140
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,667
Now, what's the reality over here?

141
00:10:53,667 --> 00:11:02,210
This guy over here needs to sell his dolls for 10 Yuan, which before was the equivalent of 1 dollar.

142
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,228
But now, how much is he going to sell his Yuan for?

143
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:07,133
He needs to sell for 10 Yuan.

144
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,244
That's 8 Yuan per dollar. Right?

145
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,891
So let's think about how much his dolls cost.

146
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:20,739
So his dolls, in the US, now that the Yuan has appreciated, they were 10 Yuan.

147
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:29,333
And then, times — we have 1 dollar for every 8 Yuan.

148
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,746
So this is going to be equal to — (The Yuans cancel out.)

149
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:34,933
This is really just dimensional analysis you might have learned in chemistry.

150
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:37,467
So 10 over 8 is what?

151
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,408
That's 1 and 1/4.

152
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:44,238
This is $1.25. One dollar and 25 cents.

153
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:49,811
Notice the price of his dolls went up in the United States in terms of dollars.

154
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:56,641
And let's think about what happened to the cola manufacturer right over here.

155
00:11:56,641 --> 00:12:03,667
So his costs — or the price he needs to sell them for — are 1 dollar.

156
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,436
And now what's the exchange rate?

157
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:09,455
Let me write it the other way, because I need to cancel out the dollars.

158
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:14,760
We have 8 Yuan for every 1 dollar.

159
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,225
Dollars cancel out. 8 times 1.

160
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:24,200
His selling price in China will now be 8 Yuan.

161
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:30,533
So notice, neither of these people changed their prices in terms of their home currency.

162
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,791
No change in price at all.

163
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:36,467
But because of the currency movements, because the Yuan became more expensive,

164
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:41,847
the Chinese manufacturer's goods are now more expensive in dollars.

165
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:45,933
And the American manufacturer's goods are now less expensive in Yuan.

166
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,698
So what's going to happen?

167
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,184
What's going to happen here?

168
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:52,579
At a dollar, there was a demand for 100 dolls in the United States.

169
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,242
But now that the price has gone up to $1.25.

170
00:12:57,242 --> 00:13:09,333
now there will only be demand at this higher price for 50 dolls in the United States.

171
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:15,005
And let's say this guy over here, before, there was demand for 50 cans of his cola in China 

172
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:17,814
because it was 10 Yuan — but now, the price has gone down.

173
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:26,867
So now, you can imagine that there is demand — or actually I should say there's demand for 50 dolls.

174
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:32,392
And, now, because this guy's price has gone down, now, instead of demand for 50 cans, maybe there's demand for 

175
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:35,133
and I'll just make up a number — 80 cans.

176
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:37,644
Maybe there's now demand for 80 cans.

177
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,641
So what just happened to the trade imbalance?

178
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:47,282
Before, in terms of either currency, we were buying more dolls — if you think about from the US perspective — and shipping fewer cans of cola.

179
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:54,447
But now, we're buying fewer dolls, because it's now more expensive in the United States. and we're shipping more cola.

180
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,799
So I don't even know how this math works; I'm going to let you figure that out.

181
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,722
But as one currency gets more and more expensive, those exports 

182
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:06,523
the demand for those exports from those countries is going to go down, like we saw with these dolls.

183
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:10,467
And on the other side, as the other currency gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper,

184
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:15,214
the demand for those exports will go up; because in other currencies, it will look cheaper.

185
00:14:15,214 --> 99:59:59,999
And, eventually, you should have some type of trade balance.
