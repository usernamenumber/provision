00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:10,637
Most physics books will tell you that acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the Earth is 9.81 m/s^2.

2
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:17,299
This is an approximation, and what I want to do in this video is figure out if this is the value we get

3
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:21,641
when we actually use **Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation**

4
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:30,604
and that tells us that the force of gravity between two objects, (and let's just talk about the magnitude of the force of gravity between two objects)

5
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:38,150
is equal to the universal gravitational constant times the mass of one of the bodies,

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:47,160
<i>m1</i>, times the mass of the second body, divided by the distance between the center of masses of bodies square.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,988
So distance between the center of masses of the bodies squared.

8
00:00:52,988 --> 00:01:00,946
So let's use this, the Universal Law of Gravitation to figure out what acceleration due to gravity should be at the

9
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:02,438
surface of the Earth.

10
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:07,315
I have <i>G</i> over here, I have the mass of the Earth, which I have looked up over here,

11
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:16,108
We also have the radius of the Earth and for the sake of this we are going to assume that the distance between the body at the surface of the

12
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:25,496
Earth the distance between that and the center of the Earth is just going to be and the radius of the Earth.

13
00:01:25,496 --> 00:01:31,195
And so this will give us the magnitude of the force. If we want to figure out the magnitude of the acceleration

14
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:36,247
(which this really is. I didn't write this as the vector, so this is just the magnitude of the acceleration.

15
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:44,443
If you wanted the acceleration, which is a vector, you'd have to say downwards or towards the center of the Earth in this case)

16
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:49,711
But if you want the acceleration we just have to remember that force

17
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:55,910
is equal to mass times acceleration and if you wanted to solve for acceleration

18
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:06,427
you just divide both sides times mass. So force divided by mass is equal to acceleration or, if you want,

19
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:13,278
if you take the magnitude of the force and you divided by mass you're going to get the magnitude of the acceleration. This is a scalar

20
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:19,499
quantity, this is a scalar quantity right over here. So if you want the acceleration due to gravity,

21
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:28,253
let's try divide this in terms of the force of gravity on Earth. So the magnitude of the force of gravity on Earth.

22
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:36,195
This one right over here, so this one being the case of Earth, one of these masses is going to be Earth.

23
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:44,113
It's going to be this mass right over here. So if you want the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth

24
00:02:44,113 --> 00:02:53,168
you just have to divide by the mass that is being accelerated due to that force. And in this case it is the other

25
00:02:53,168 --> 00:03:01,813
mass. It's the mass sitting on the surface. So let's divide both sides by that mass,

26
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:09,813
and this will give us the magnitude of the acceleration on that mass due to gravity.

27
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:18,010
So this is equal to the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity.

28
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,562
And the more reason that this is actually simplifying thing is that these two, these

29
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:30,827
<i>m2</i> and <i>m2</i> cancel out, so the magnitude of our acceleration due to gravity using Newton's Universal Law

30
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:38,211
of Gravitation is just going to be this expression right over here. It's going to be the Gravitational constant

31
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:47,267
times the mass of the Earth divided by the distance between the object's center of mass and the center

32
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:51,423
of the mass of the Earth. And we're going to assume the the object is right at the surface, and its center of mass

33
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:58,338
is at the surface. So this is actually going to be the radius of the Earth squared.

34
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:05,861
Sometimes this is also viewed as the gravitational field at the surface of the Earth, because if you it multiply by mass

35
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:13,332
it tells you how much force is pulling on that mass. With that out of the way let's actually use a calculator to calculate what this value

36
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:21,161
is and then what I want to do is, one, compare it to the value that the textbooks tell us and see if maybe why it may or

37
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:26,316
may not be different, and then think about how it changes as we get further and further away from

38
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:31,557
the surface of the Earth, and in particular, if we get to an altitude where the space shuttle or International Space Station

39
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:40,482
might be at. This is an altitude of 400 km, give or take a little bit, depending on what it is up to. So

40
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:50,065
let's figure out what this value is when we use Universal Law of Gravitation. So let's get my calculator out.

41
00:04:50,065 --> 00:05:08,384
We know what <i>G</i> is, 6.6738*10^-11. This "E" button means "times 10 to the-11"

42
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:14,569
and I want to multiply that times the mass of the Earth, which is right over here,

43
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:31,279
and it's 5.9722*10^24 and we want to divide that by radius of Earth squared.

44
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:43,940
So this is in kilometers, and I want to make sure everything is in the same units. So 6371 km is the same thing as

45
00:05:43,940 --> 00:06:04,573
6,371,000 m (you could just multiply that by a thousand). Or you could even write this as 6.371*10^6 m and we're going to square this.

46
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:12,686
That's the radius of Earth, the distance from the center of mass of Earth, and the center of the mass of this object, which is sitting at the surface of the Earth.

47
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:19,745
So let's get our drumroll, and we get... 9.8 and if we round we actually get something a

48
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:32,400
little higher than what the textbooks give us. We get 9.82. Let's just round it, so we get 9.82 m/s^2. And so you might say,

49
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:44,567
"What's going on here? Why do we get a discrepancy between what the Universal Law of Gravitation gives us and what is the average measured due to gravity at the surface of the Earth?"

50
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:49,351
And the discrepancy here, the discrepancy between these two numbers is really because

51
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:58,082
Earth is not a uniform sphere of uniform density, and that's what we have to assume here with Universal Law of Gravitation.

52
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:05,515
It's actually a little bit flatter than a perfect sphere and definitely doesn't have uniform density.

53
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:10,109
Different layers of the Earth have different densities, you have all sorts of different interactions,

54
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:16,187
Also, if you measure effective gravity, there also a little bit of a buoyancy effect from the air,

55
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:24,227
very, very negligible (I don't know if it would've been enough to change this), but there's other minor, minor effects, irregularities,

56
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,106
Earth is not a perfect sphere, it is not of uniform density,

57
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:34,096
and that is what accounts for the bulk of this. Now that out of the way, what I'm curious about is what is the acceleration

58
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:40,158
due to gravity if we go up 400 km. So now, the main difference here

59
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,790
<i>G</i> will stay the same,

60
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,523
the mass of Earth will stay the same,

61
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:48,237
but the radius is now going to be different because now we're placing the center of mass of our object

62
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:51,335
whether it's the Space Station or someone sitting in the Space Station, they're going to

63
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:57,757
be 400 km higher and I'm going to exaggerate what 400 km looks like. This is not drawn to scale.

64
00:07:57,757 --> 00:08:05,578
But now the radius is the radius of the earth plus 400 km. So now for the case of the Space Station,

65
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:16,730
<i>r</i> going to be not 6371 km, we're going to add 400 km to this, 6771 km, which is the

66
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:33,950
same thing as 6,771,000 m, which is the same thing as 6.771*10^6 m. So let's go back to our calculator

67
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:42,246
We should be able to just second entry [that's the last entry we had] and instead of

68
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:54,042
6.371*10^6, let's add 400 km to that. So it was 371 and it's now 771 km.

69
00:08:54,042 --> 00:09:01,028
What do we get? We get We get 8.69 m/s^2.

70
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:12,156
So now, the acceleration here, is 8.69 m/s^2. And you can verify that the units work out because

71
00:09:12,156 --> 00:09:21,421
Over there gravity is m^3/kg*s^2, you multiply that by mass of the Earth, which is kg. The kg cancels out with these kg.

72
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:29,685
And then you're dividing by m^2. You're left with m/s^2. So the units work out as well.

73
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:34,027
So there's an important thing to realise and this is a misconception.

74
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:38,137
We do a whole video on it earlier when we talk about the Universal Law of Gravitation.

75
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:47,260
There is gravity when you are in orbit up here. The only reason why it feels like there's no gravity or it looks like there's no gravity

76
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:53,311
is that this Space Station is moving so fast that it's essentially in freefall but it moves so fast

77
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:59,638
that it keeps missing the Earth. And in the next video we'll figure out how fast does it have to

78
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:03,638
travel in order to stay in orbit, in order for it not to plummet to Earth due to the force of gravity, due to the acceleration that is occurring, this centripetal, center-seeking acceleration.
