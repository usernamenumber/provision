00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,740
Problem 52.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,310
Colleen solved the equation 2 times 2x plus 5

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,030
is equal to 8 using the following steps.

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,860
OK, so she has a bunch of steps.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,320
To get from Step 2 to Step 3, Colleen--

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,280
so it's good that I read the question before

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,480
I just started diving into it.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,500
So to get from Step 2 to Step 3-- so this is her Step 2,

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,220
and this is her Step 3 right here.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,040
What did she do to get from here to here?

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,030
Well, she divided both sides by 4. Right?

12
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,690
You could say 4x is equal to minus 2.

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:38,590
If you divide both sides of this equation by 4,

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,340
the left-hand side-- these cancel out,

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,360
you're just left with x.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,610
And then the right-hand side,

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,780
minus 2/4 is just minus 1/2.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,020
So she just divided both sides by 4.

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,000
And that is choice A.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,020
She definitely didn't subtract 4 from both sides.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,030
She didn't add 4 to both sides.

22
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,300
And she didn't multiply both sides by 4.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,020
Then we would have had 16x minus 8.

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,000
So that was a pretty straightforward problem.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,020
And then 53.

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,020
What is the reciprocal of ax squared over y?

27
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,000
This is another, you just have to know what a reciprocal is.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,430
A reciprocal of something is just 1 over that something.

29
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,050
Or if it's a fraction, you just flip it.

30
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,570
So if you have a/b, the reciprocal is b/a.

31
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,500
If you have xy/ab,

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
the reciprocal is going to be ab/xy.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,730
So if you have ax squared over y,

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,030
its reciprocal is just going to be y over ax squared.

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,220
That easy.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,010
And that is choice D, y over ax squared.

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,080
You just have to know to flip this fraction right there.
