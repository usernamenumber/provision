1
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:10,138
The king's advisor, Arbegla, is watching all of this discourse between you, the king, the bird. And he's starting to feel a little bit jealous

2
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:14,354
'cause he's supposed to be the wise man in the kingdom, the king's closest advisor.

3
00:00:14,354 --> 00:00:17,221
So he steps in and says, "okay, so if you and this bird"

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:22,904
"are so smart, how about you tackle the Riddle of the Fruit Prices?"

5
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:27,838
And the king says, "Yes, that is something that we haven't been able to figure out."

6
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:32,521
"The fruit prices. Arbegla, tell them the riddle of the fruit prices."

7
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,739
And so Arbegla says, "Well,"

8
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,221
"we wanna keep track of how much our fruit costs, but we forgot"

9
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:45,622
"to actually log how much it costs when we went to the market but we know how much in total we spent"

10
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:50,238
"we know much we got. We know that one week ago, when we went to"

11
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,987
"the fruit market, we bought two, two, pounds of"

12
00:00:55,987 --> 00:01:01,387
"apples, we bought two pounds of apples, and one pound of bananas."

13
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:09,087
"one pound, I guess, of bananans, bananas. And the total cost"

14
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:15,254
"that, time, was three dollars, so there was three dollars, three dollars"

15
00:01:15,254 --> 00:01:21,636
in total cost. And then when we went the time before that we went the time before that

16
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:26,321
we bought six pounds of bananas or six pounds of apples I should say

17
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:32,487
Six pounds of apples. And three pounds three pounds of

18
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:36,954
bananas. Ba-nanas. And

19
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:42,705
the total cost at that point was fifteen dollars. So

20
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:46,271
what is the cost of apples and bananas?

21
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,353
So you look at the bird:

22
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:51,654
The bird looks at you, the bird whispers into the king's ear, and the king says

23
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:56,671
Well the bird says we'll just start defining some variables here, so we'll start expressing this thing algebraically

24
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:01,955
So you go about doing that. What we want to figure out is the cost of apples and the cost of bananas.

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,688
Per pound. So we set some variables. So let's...

26
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:17,405
let a= the cost cost of apples, apple per pound. Per pound

27
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:23,054
And let's let b = the cost of bananas.

28
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:29,072
Ba-nanas. Bananas per pound. So how could we interpret

29
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:34,138
this first information right here? Two pounds of apples and a pound of bananas cost

30
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:43,054
$3. So how much are the apples going to cost? Well it's going to cost 2, two pounds times

31
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:48,338
the cost per pound, times a, that's going to be the total cost of apples

32
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:53,820
in this scenarios, and what's the total cost of the banana? Well it's one pound times the cost

33
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,639
per pound. So, you're just going to have b, that's the total cost

34
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,404
of the bananas, cause we know we bought one the total cost of the apples and bananas

35
00:03:03,404 --> 00:03:07,304
are going to be 2a+b and we know what that total cost is

36
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:14,938
it is, it is $3. Now let's do the same thing for the other time we went to the market. Simply

37
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:20,137
Six pounds of apple, the total cost is going to be six pounds times A dollars

38
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:23,605
per pound and the total cost of banas is going to be

39
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:25,570
well we bought three poiund of bananas.

40
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,938
and the cost per pound is b

41
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,488
and so the total cost of apples and bananas

42
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:35,936
this scenario is going to be = to 15

43
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:38,721
is going to be = to $15

44
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:41,204
so let's think about how we might want to solve it

45
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:44,053
we could use elimination we could use substitution

46
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,753
whatever we want, we might do it graphically

47
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,754
let's try it first with elimination.

48
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,804
so the first thing I might want to do is

49
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:54,338
is maybe I want to eliminate let's say I want to eliminate

50
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,656
the a variable right over here so I have two

51
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,039
a over here, I have six a over here

52
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:03,838
so if I multiply this entire right equation by

53
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:09,088
-3 then this 2a would become a -6a and then it might

54
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,504
be able to cancel out with that

55
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:11,421
so let me do that

56
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,589
let me multiply this entire equation

57
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:16,638
times -3

58
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:19,337
times negative three

59
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:23,071
so -3 * 2a is -6a

60
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:27,256
-3 * b is -3b

61
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,555
and then -3 * 3 is -9

62
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:32,821
is -9

63
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:35,888
and now we can essentially add the two equations

64
00:04:35,888 --> 00:04:38,071
or essentially add the left side of this to the left side of that

65
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:40,372
or the right side of this equation to the right side of that

66
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:44,188
we're essentially adding the same thing to both sides of this equation

67
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:46,054
because we know this is equal to that

68
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,288
So let's do that

69
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,888
let's do it

70
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,671
So on the left hand side, 6a and 6a cancel out.

71
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:57,320
But something else interesting happens, the 3b and the 3b cancels out as well.

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,771
So we're just left with 0 on the left hand side.

73
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,654
And on the right hand side, what do we have?

74
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:07,987
15 - 9 = 6.

75
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:12,271
So we get this bizarre statement! All of our variables have gone away

76
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,738
And we're left with this bizarre nonsensical statement that

77
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:22,289
0 = 6, which we know is definitely not the case.

78
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,472
So what's going on over here? What's going on?

79
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:29,455
And then, you you you say, what's going on and you look at the bird

80
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,188
'cause the bird seems to be the most knowledgeable person in the room

81
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,455
or at least the most knowledgeable vertebrate

82
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,236
in the room. And so the bird whispers into the king's ear

83
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:42,471
and the king says, "Well, he says that there's no solution

84
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,088
and you should at least try to graph it to see why."

85
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,822
And you say, well, the bird seems to know what he's talking about

86
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:51,604
So let me attempt to graph these two equations and see

87
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:52,621
what's going on.

88
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:57,238
And so what you do is, you take each of the equation

89
00:05:57,238 --> 00:05:59,321
and you like, when you graph it, you like to put

90
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:02,671
it in kind of the y-intercept form or slope intercept form

91
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,488
and so you do that, so you say, well let me

92
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,290
solve both of these for b

93
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,904
so if you want to solve this first equation for b

94
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,304
you just subtract 2a from both sides

95
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:14,887
if you subtract 2a from both sides of this first equation

96
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:18,354
you get b is = to -2a

97
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:23,204
+ 3. Now solve this second equation for b.

98
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:27,770
So the first thing you might wanna do is subtract 6a from both sides.

99
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,271
So you would get, you would get, I'll do it right over, let me do it right over here.

100
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:38,955
You would get 3b, 3b is = to -6a plus 15

101
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:41,638
and then you can divide both sides by 3

102
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:44,122
you get b is = to -2a

103
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:49,688
plus, plus 5. So the second equation, let me revert back

104
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:53,471
to that other shade of green, is b is = to -2a

105
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:57,504
plus 5. And we haven't even graphed it yet, but it looks like

106
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,253
something interesting is going on.

107
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,938
They both have the exact same slope

108
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:04,921
when you solve in terms, when you solve for b

109
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:08,404
but they seem to have different, let's call them, b-intercepts

110
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,539
let's graph it to actually see what's going on

111
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:16,804
so let me get, draw some axes over here, let's call that my b-axis

112
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:20,372
and then this could be my, a axis

113
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:24,504
And this first equation has a b-intercept of positive 3

114
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:28,104
so let's see, one, two, three four five

115
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:31,354
the first one has a b-intercept of positive three

116
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:33,755
and it has a slope of negative 2

117
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:36,455
So you go down or you go to the right one

118
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,504
you go down two. Go to the right one, you go down two.

119
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:41,054
So the line looks something like this.

120
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:44,071
I'm trying my best to draw it straight. So it looks

121
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,804
it looks something something like that

122
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,603
And I'll just draw this green one.

123
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,904
This green one, our b-intercept is 5

124
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,671
so it's right over here. but we have the exact same slope

125
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:57,154
the slope of -2, so it looks

126
00:07:57,154 --> 00:08:04,123
it looks something something like that right over there

127
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:07,421
and you immediately see now that the bird was right

128
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,805
There is no solution because these two constraints

129
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:14,622
represent or can be represented by lines that

130
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:20,004
don't intersect. So the lines don't, don't intersect.

131
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:22,254
In-ter-sect.

132
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:25,588
They don't intersect, and so the bird is right

133
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:30,138
there's no solution, there's no x and y that can make this statement equal true!

134
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:35,171
Or that can make 0 = 6, there is no possible, there is no overlap between these two

135
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,855
things. And so something gets into your brain.

136
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:40,938
You realize that Arbegla is trying to stump you.

137
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,421
And you say, Arbegla, you have given me

138
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,871
in-con-sistent information!

139
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:48,904
This is an in-con-sistent system of equations!

140
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:53,138
In. In...con...sistent. Which happens to be the word

141
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:55,220
that is sometimes used to refer to a system

142
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,304
that has no solutions, where the lines do not

143
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,720
intersect. And there fore this information is incorrect

144
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,939
We cannot assume that the apple or banana

145
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:08,687
Either you are lying, which is possible, or you accounted for it wrong

146
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:12,304
Or maybe the prices of apples and bananas actually changed

147
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:14,789
between the two visits of the market.

148
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:18,539
At which point the bird whispered into the King's ear,

149
00:09:18,539 --> 99:59:59,999
and says, oh, this character isn't so bad at this algebra stuff.
