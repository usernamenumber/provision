1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
We are on problem number 22.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,000
And their question is straightforward enough.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,930
What is the value of the integer x?

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,080
And they tells us it's an integer.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,340
x is equal to what?

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,210
So the first statement, x is prime.

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,840
Well, there are a lot of prime integers.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,590
So there's actually an infinite number of them.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,030
So that alone doesn't tell us what x is.

10
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,050
Two.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,830
Let's see, 31 is less than or equal to x,

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,000
which is less than or equal to 37.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,640
Well, immediately, this is useless information because

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,530
31 and 37 are both prime numbers as far as I can tell, right

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,190
They're both prime numbers. So this means that x could be 31.

16
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,340
It could be 37.

17
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,470
Or let's see, are there any prime numbers in between?

18
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,030
32, 33, 34, 35. Well, there are no prime numbers in between,

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,220
but it could be either 31 or 37,

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,770
so it doesn't help us much even used in combination.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,760
I mean, this alone is definitely useless,

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,550
because this is a range of six numbers.

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,680
And even if we know x is prime, if we use this and this,

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,000
all we know is that x is either 31 or 37, so the answer is E.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,170
Together, they're not sufficient, E

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,660
Now, if this was a little bit different,

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,070
if this was x is greater than 31 and less than or equal to 37

28
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,180
then we would know, oh, x has to be 37.

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,170
Or if this wasn't here and this was there,

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,940
then we would know that x is 31.

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,270
But anyway, they didn't do that.

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,400
They gave us the option, so and the answer is E.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,090
Problem 23.

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,030
If P, Q and R are three distinct points,

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,320
do line segments PQ and PR have the same length?

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,030
So P, Q and R.

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,360
They want to know if these two lines are the same length.

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,530
This is line PQ and this is the line PR.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,880
So are those the same length?

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,010
Let's see if we can figure this out.

41
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:16,240
Statement one tells us P is the midpoint of line segment QR.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,020
OK, P, midpoint, so I've already drawn it wrong.

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,240
Midpoint of QR. So let me redraw it,

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,930
so all three points actually end up being on the same line,

45
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,470
because P is the midpoint of QR.

46
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,060
So this is the line.

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,560
This is point Q.

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
This is point R.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,880
So if P is the midpoint, P is right there, and that tells us

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,280
that this distance is the same as this distance,

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:59,020
which also tells us that QP, line segment QP is equal to PR.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,650
And that's what I think what they wanted us-- yeah, right.

53
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,160
They want to say does PQ and PR have same length?

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,510
This is PQ So PQ and PR definitely have the same length.

55
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,380
So statement one is definitely true,because P is the midpoint

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,660
Let's see about statement two.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,870
I mean, statement one implies that

58
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,910
they have to be on the same line;

59
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,940
otherwise, P couldn't have been the midpoint.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,050
Let's see if statement two is interesting.

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,040
Statement two: Q and R lie in the same circle with center P.

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:42,360
Interesting. So this is saying a circle with center P,

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,590
and Q and R both lie on this circle. So Q could be here.

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,010
I'm just picking two random points. R could be here.

65
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,360
So we want to know whether PQ is equal to PR, right?

66
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,210
That was the question.

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,690
Well, the definition of a circle is all points

68
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,600
that are equal distant from P.

69
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,330
So R has to be the same distance from P.

70
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,250
It's going to be one radius of the circle away from P as Q is

71
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,680
because they're both on the circle,

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,800
and they're all equal distance from p.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,110
So PR is going to be equal to PQ.

74
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,480
They're going to be equal to each other.

75
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,280
So once again, two alone is sufficient.

76
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,040
So the answer is D, each statement alone is sufficient.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,390
Problem 24.

78
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,110
The problems are getting a little bit more interesting.

79
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,610
Is the number x between 0.2 and 0.7?

80
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,380
So if I just write it 0.2 is less than x,

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,530
which less than 0.7, that's what they want to know.

82
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:03,340
Statement one tells us that 560x is less than 280.

83
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,830
You know you don't even have to solve this.

84
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,080
This is a fairly simple equation.

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,430
You can easily solve for x, and if you can solve for x,

86
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,500
you can answer this question.

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,000
So you actually don't have to go to the trouble.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,170
If you want to, you can then just divide both sides by 560,

89
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,000
but that takes time, valuable time.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,030
You're taking the GMAT.

91
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,850
And that is equal to 1/2, right? 28/56 is 1/2.

92
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,000
And then you'd say, sure, x is between the two numbers.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,360
But you didn't have to do this.

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,960
That's a waste of time.

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,120
All you have to do say, oh, I can solve for x,

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,370
so I can test that, whether that's true or not.

97
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,010
Part 2ŁŹStatement two says 700x is equal to 280.

98
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,850
Same thing.

99
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,680
You just look at it. You're like, oh, I could solve for x.

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,470
If I can solve for x,

101
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,710
I can tell you whether x is between those two numbers,

102
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,880
and that's the end of it.

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,100
And you say, oh, each of these independently are sufficient

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,440
to answer this question.

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,630
But if you wanted to prove it to yourself

106
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,470
and see if this question is true or false, you can just say,

107
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,480
well, x is equal to 280/700.

108
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,080
That is equal to 2.28/7.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,970
That is equal to 0.4.

110
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,940
I just divide the top and the bottom by 7, and you get 0.4.

111
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,450
So once again, it is between it. You answered the question.

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,120
But you remember, the question doesn't have to be affirmative

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,830
You just have to figure out

114
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,100
if the data is enough to answer the question,

115
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,570
and we didn't have to go through this and this.

116
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,400
You could have just looked at it and said,

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,040
oh, I can solve for x in either way and then just test it.

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Next, problem. 25.

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,990
If i and j are integers, is i plus j even?

120
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,420
So statement number one is that i is less than 10.

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,040
That tells me nothing.

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,070
That to me seems kind of useless.

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,750
Statement number two is i is equal to j.

124
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, that's interesting.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,770
So what's i plus j then going to be equal to?

126
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,730
Well, that's the same thing as-- since i is equal to j,

127
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,000
that's the same thing as j plus j, which equals 2j.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Or you could say, if you substitute j for i,

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,190
or if you substitute i for j,

130
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,760
that's the same thing as i plus i,which is equal to 2i.

131
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,860
In either case, you immediately see that

132
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,230
either of these numbers are a multiple of two

133
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,030
and therefore have to be even, because i and j are integers.

134
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,540
So statement two alone is sufficient,

135
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,020
and statement one is useless.

136
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,180
Problem 26.

137
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,070
n plus k is equal to m.

138
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,010
What is the value of k?

139
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,020
So we could solve for it, if we could answer this, because

140
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,440
k is equal to m minus n, and that would solve our answer.

141
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's see if the statements give us any help.

142
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,070
n is equal to 10.

143
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,720
Well, that'll just tells us that k is equal to m minus 10.

144
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,120
It still doesn't tell us what k is,

145
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,080
because we don't know what m is.

146
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,000
Statement number two.

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,930
m plus 10 is equal to n.

148
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,890
This is interesting.

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,000
So this tells us that, what does this tell us?

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,660
So let's see,

151
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,620
if we can figure out from this statement what m minus n is,

152
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,170
then we're in business.

153
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,430
Let's see, let's subtract n from both sides.

154
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,030
You get m minus n plus 10 is equal to 0.

155
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,770
Subtract 10 from both sides,

156
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,040
you get m minus n is equal to minus 10.

157
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,390
Well, we know that k is equal to m minus n.

158
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,280
m minus n is equal to minus 10, so this is equal to k.

159
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,010
So we solved for k, using just statement two alone.

160
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,480
Just statement two alone is sufficient.

161
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,690
And statement one is-- I mean, it kind of gets us halfway,

162
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,680
but you really don't need it.

163
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,080
Statement two is all you need, so that is b.

164
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,130
Let's see if we have time for one more. Yeah, sure, why not.

165
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,250
They have drawn a triangle for us.

166
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,020
I'll draw it quick and dirty.

167
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,680
This is angle x. This is angle z, and this is angle y.

168
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,100
And they want to know is this triangle equilateral,

169
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,060
which means are all the sides equal to each other?

170
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,050
So statement one tells us that x is equal to y.

171
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,010
So we break out a little bit of our

172
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,020
eighth or ninth grade geometry here.

173
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,380
So if x is equal to y,if these angles are equal to each other

174
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,170
what that tells us is that these sides are equal to

175
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,020
each other the corresponding sides are the same.

176
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,480
I could actually redraw this triangle like this.

177
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,610
Maybe it'll jog those neurons from ninth grade.

178
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,020
This is x. This is y, and this is z.

179
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,850
And you could test it out, if you don't believe me.

180
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,630
And we've gone over this in the geometry module.

181
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,550
If x and y are equal to each other,

182
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,190
then these sides have to be equal to each other.

183
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,300
And you could just try to imagine drawing a triangle

184
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
that has two base angles equal to each other

185
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,000
and the sides are different.

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,290
It would be impossible.

187
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,400
The sides would have to be the same.

188
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,480
This triangle would have to be

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,780
at least isosceles and maybe equilateral.

190
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,030
Isosceles is two sides being the same.

191
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,700
But that by itself doesn't tell us

192
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,730
that this is an equilateral triangle.

193
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,140
In order for this to be equilateral,

194
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,610
z has to be the same as x and y.

195
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,660
They all have to be.

196
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,780
And if they're all going to be the same,

197
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,020
they all add up to 180, they all have to be 60 degrees.

198
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,720
So you could have a situation

199
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,000
where x and y are both 20 degrees.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,680
This is 20, this is 20, then they add up to 40.

201
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,370
And then z would have to be 140 in which case,

202
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,010
we would not have an equilateral triangle,

203
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,160
so one alone is not sufficient.

204
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,010
Let's see was statement two tells us.

205
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:22,010
Statement two tells us z is equal to 60 degrees.

206
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,010
So that by itself-- so first of all,

207
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,110
we know if we know both of these pieces of information,

208
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,500
we are definitely dealing with an equilateral triangle.

209
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,720
Because think about it.

210
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,970
If z is 60, and then we use this information that

211
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,290
these two are equal to each other, what do we know?

212
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,000
If z is 60, then these two added together have to--

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
so x plus y plus z are going to be equal to 180.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,430
If z is 60, then x plus y have to be equal to--

215
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,180
subtract z from both sides, or subtract 60 from both sides--

216
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,010
has to be equal to 120.

217
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,650
And since these are equal to each other,

218
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,840
x and y both would have to be equal to 60 degrees, right?

219
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,040
So if you use both of this information, all of the angles

220
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,080
are going to be 60 degrees and it's eqilateral.

221
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,100
So we know that definitely in combination,

222
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,280
we can figure it out.

223
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,070
But what about just if z is equal to 60?

224
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,060
Well, I can easily draw a triangle that disproves that.

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,230
So if I have a 60-degree angle here-- in fact,

226
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,600
it might be a 30-60-90 triangle like you learned in school,

227
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,020
so it could be 60 degrees, 30 degrees, and 90 degrees.

228
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,070
This could be z.

229
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,980
And this definitely is not an equilateral triangle.

230
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,010
And so if just by z being 60 degrees, in no way are you

231
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,940
saying that this is definitely an equilateral triangle.

232
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,570
You have to have the other condition that x is equal to y.

233
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,970
And so the answer is, let's see, C,

234
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,350
both statements together are sufficient,

235
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,520
but neither statement alone is sufficient.

236
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,030
The answer is C.

237
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,020
See you in the next video.
