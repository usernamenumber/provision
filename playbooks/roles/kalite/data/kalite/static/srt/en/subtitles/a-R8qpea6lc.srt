00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:04,281
When Japan faced its own banking and debt crisis in the 1990s

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,474
the first thing it did is it started to lower its target interest rate,

3
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:11,544
or the rate the banks borrow reserves from each other.

4
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,529
And the way to do that is you print money.

5
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:19,137
In the case of Japan, the central bank prints Yen, it buys short-term government securities,

6
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:24,727
but the by-product of that is that it increases the amount of currency or reserves in circulation,

7
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:27,402
all banks have more reserves,

8
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,815
so the demand for that reserves will go down,

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,953
or the cost of borrowing it will go down.

10
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:34,430
And so, it lowers the interest rate.

11
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:38,580
But Japan did that enough so they got to a zero percent interest rate,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,092
but then it really couldn't lower the interest rate anymore

13
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:45,043
and that's exactly what Bernanke is faced with the US credit crisis.

14
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:46,871
So the next thing that Japan said was

15
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,170
"Okay, we still want more money to enter into circulation,

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:56,393
so we gonna keep printing more Yen".

17
00:00:56,393 --> 00:01:00,125
But since it's really of no use to buy short-term debt anymore,

18
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,892
because we've already kind of priced those as high as we can,

19
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:05,679
we've lowered short-term interest rates as much as possible,

20
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:08,963
let's use this stuff to buy other things.

21
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:12,269
Let's just get this money into circulation any which way we can.

22
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,323
So let's buy long-term japanese treasuries, let's buy corporate debt.

23
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:26,748
So they did buy a bunch of stuff, but their intention was literally just to increase the quantity of money.

24
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:30,824
So what the Japanese did was kind of pure quantitative easing.

25
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:38,767
They were trying to print money at any cost and let that money go into circulation at any which way is possible and they would buy a bunch of stuff to do it.

26
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:44,098
What Bernanke is doing mechanically is not that different than what the Japanese did.

27
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:48,749
He started off trying to lower short-term interest rate, so he would buy short-term securities,

28
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,148
it would increase the amount of reserves in circulation,

29
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:55,389
lower the overnight borrowing rate, lower the Federal Funds rate,

30
00:01:55,389 --> 00:02:00,842
but when that went to zero percent, so they both hit this floor at zero percent,

31
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,674
Bernanke is like, "Well, how do I solve the log jam in the credit markets?"

32
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:12,709
And Bernanke, just like Japan, says "Well, I am going to start printing more money and I am going to use it to buy assets that the Fed does not traditionally buy."

33
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:15,338
And Japan did this as well.

34
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:22,349
The difference, and this is how Bernanke explains the difference, is he doesn't view this as pure quantitative easing

35
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,318
not because it is mechanically different, because it really is mechanically the same thing,

36
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,818
but he calls it "Credit Easing". And in his mind the difference between Quantitative and Credit Easing is the intent

37
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,232
and where you direct that extra money that you've printed.

38
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:44,898
In Japan's case, they printed money for the sake of printing money and they bought all of this stuff just to get that money into circulation.

39
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:52,151
In Bernanke's case, he is printing money, he does want that money in circulation, but that's not the end that he is trying to achieve.

40
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:57,680
The end is to increase demand for some of these types of securities, where

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,958
maybe there's a log jam. Even though mechanically they are the same, Bernanke

42
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:06,133
says "This is Credit Easing, because I am trying to fix the problem in commercial debt market",

43
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,423
or "I am trying to fix the problem in the mortgage backed security market"

44
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:13,510
while Japan was just trying to print money for the sake of printing money.
