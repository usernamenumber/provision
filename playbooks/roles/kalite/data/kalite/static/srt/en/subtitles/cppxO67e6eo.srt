1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,810
My son has been successfully
subdued, so I think this is a

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,474
good time to learn about the
Price to Earnings ratio.

4
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:17,030
   

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,800
And a lot of times you'll
hear people talk about

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
a stock's P/E Ratio.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,530
And it's all the same thing.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,560
It's just a faster
way of saying

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,300
Price to Earnings ratio.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,720
So let's think about the Price
to Earnings ratio of the

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,100
company in question, this widget
case study, I guess you

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,350
could call it, that we've
been dealing with.

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,370
Let's say that the market
value-- we talked before that

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,170
the book value per share
of this company is $5.

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,590
Because the book value of its
equity is $5 million.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,060
And there's 1 million shares.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,890
So 5 million divided
by 1 million is $5.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,860
But let's say that the market
price, let's say that this is

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,800
Widgets Inc. and let's say
that its ticker symbol is

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:12,500
WINC, for Widgets Inc. And its
price is, it's trading at--

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,140
let me make up a good
number-- let's say

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,640
it's trading at $3.50.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,970
And then we learned in the first
video that a price by

24
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,170
itself doesn't tell
us a whole lot.

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,700
So how may shares are there?

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,305
We know there's a
million shares.

27
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:34,780
   

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,602
So the market cap, or what the
market perceives the value of

29
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:41,380
this equity is, the market
capitalization,

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,100
is these two numbers.

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,130
If we have a million shares,
then each of them, the market

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,450
is saying, is worth $3.50, then
the equity of the company

33
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,230
is worth $3.5 million.

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:02,680
   

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,550
And this is the market value of
the equity, what the market

36
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,610
thinks the equity's worth.

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,699
So this is interesting.

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,500
In our case, the book value of
the equity was $5 million.

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,230
But the market is saying, no,
no, I don't necessarily

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,680
believe those accountants.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,810
Maybe they're throwing some
stuff in here that's not

42
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,720
really there.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,350
So we say it's only worth
$3.5 million.

44
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,010
In this case, the company's
trading at a discount to its

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,970
book value.

46
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,060
And I won't go into detail on
that now, but that's actually

47
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,970
a fairly unusual circumstance,
unless people are very

48
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,040
suspicious about the accounting
or the actual book

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,960
value of the company.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,970
Or if they think that this is
just a kind of an asset with a

51
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,040
useful life that has
been shortened.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,060
If you owned a bunch of video
stores, then all of a sudden

53
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,390
you say, I have $10 million of
video stores, and then the

54
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,950
next day someone makes on-demand
videos there, all of

55
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,040
a sudden, maybe your assets
aren't worth what you thought

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,730
they were before.

57
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,430
But we'll talk a lot more about
that when we deal with

58
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,280
real examples.

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,580
But in this case our market cap
is below our book value.

60
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,240
And you can even look at
it from the price.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,610
I said the price doesn't
tell you much.

62
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,440
But it tells you a decent
bit if you think

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,530
of things in per-share.

64
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,260
Because we know that the book
value per share is $5.

65
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,990
The price per share, the market
price per share, is

66
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,370
$3.50, so you could also
say it's trading at

67
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,160
a discount to book.

68
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,050
Now, what were the earnings
of the company?

69
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,800
Well it was making $0.35.

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,670
So let me write this down.

71
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:45,550
Earnings was $350,000 in 2008.

72
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,900
And let's just say we're looking
this from the vantage

73
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,560
point that 2008 has happened.

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,650
This isn't like I'm at the

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,590
beginning of 2008 and modeling.

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,760
So let's say we're looking at
this on January 1, 2009.

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,980
And let's say the company has
already released its earnings,

78
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,480
although it normally
takes a lot longer.

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,120
Probably closer to
45 to 90 days.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,710
But let's say they released
their earnings.

81
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,800
So we say, oh this company
made $350,000 in 2008.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,920
Or another thing that you might
see a lot when you look

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,839
at companies, is that this is
trailing 12 months earnings.

84
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,400
You'll see this TTM sometimes.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,320
Because when someone says
earnings, are those the

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,460
earnings last year?

87
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,660
Are those the earnings
that you're

88
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,260
predicting for next year?

89
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,060
So this is trailing 12
months earnings.

90
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:40,150
And if you want to look at
earnings per share, EPS, is

91
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,650
this number divided by the
number of shares was $0.35.

92
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,120
So first, just to learn what
the Price to Earnings ratio

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,570
is, let's just calculate it.

94
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,000
Then we can talk about what it
actually means and if we have

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,260
time, we can have a discussion
on why a company might have a

96
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,610
higher or lower Price
to Earnings Ratio.

97
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,320
And that discussion can actually
get quite involved.

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,700
But in this case, you literally
just take the price

99
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,260
of the stock and you divide it
by the earnings per share.

100
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,360
So let me switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,500
The Price to Earnings ratio
is equal to the price-- so

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,260
$3.50-- divided by the
earnings per share.

103
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,200
Divided by $0.35.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,980
So in this case, the Price
to Earnings ratio is 10.

105
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,440
What does that tell you?

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,260
well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

107
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,600
One is, you could kind
of flip this.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,250
No-one ever talks about the
Earnings to Price ratio, but

109
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,780
that's an interesting thing
to even think about.

110
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,470
Because it connects it with
a lot of other financial

111
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,460
concepts that are out there.

112
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,790
So this is kind of a Sal special
ratio, but it's a

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,660
useful one to think about.

114
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,870
The Earnings to Price ratio is
just the inverse of this.

115
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,820
0.35:3.50, which is
equal to 1/10.

116
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,470
Or 10%.

117
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:06,740
And so the way to think about
it is if you're paying $3.50

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,100
per share for this company, and
let's say the company next

119
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,290
year-- so this is trailing
12 months earnings.

120
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,110
But let's say this company, for
whatever reason, it's a

121
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,255
really stable company.

122
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:17,890
It's doing the same
thing every year.

123
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,750
It's not growing.

124
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,900
It's not shrinking.

125
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,020
Let's say that not only is this
the trailing 12 months

126
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,130
earnings, but this is also--
actually, I'll introduce

127
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,460
terminology right here.

128
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,810
So this is trailing 12 months.

129
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,930
You could also have
forward earnings.

130
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,730
   

131
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,600
What are forward earnings?

132
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,910
You can probably guess.

133
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,750
The earnings I just said, this
is actually what happened to

134
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,180
the company.

135
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,160
This was the earnings of
the company last year,

136
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,580
or the last 12 months.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,240
Forward earnings are, you know,
there's a bunch of guys

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,560
with MBAs and CFAs working for
the banks, and they write

139
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,390
research reports.

140
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,750
And they model the company.

141
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,980
They meet with the company.

142
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,420
They analyze the industry.

143
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,440
And if they're good analysts,
they'll come up with a number.

144
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,250
They'll say, I think
this company is

145
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,080
not going to change.

146
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,190
It's such a super
stable business.

147
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:11,880
They're going to make $0.35
in 2009 as well.

148
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,920
So in this case, this would
be the forward earnings.

149
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,170
And usually if it's a
well-followed company, there

150
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,640
might be 10 or 15
or 20 analysts.

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,230
And what they do is they average
out all of the numbers

152
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,580
from all of those analysts.

153
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,490
And then if the average is,
let's say, $0.35, they'll call

154
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,320
this the consensus.

155
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,280
So the consensus is just the
average of all of the sell

156
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,500
side analysts out there.

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,530
And maybe I should do a whole
video on what sell side means,

158
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,840
but since I said the word
I'll tell you right now.

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,900
Sell side are like the
investment banks and the

160
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,660
research houses.

161
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,470
And the reason why they're the
sell side is because they're

162
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,830
always selling you stuff.

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,130
They're selling you stocks.

164
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,530
They're brokering
transactions.

165
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,210
They write these research
reports because they want to

166
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,320
go to institutional investors
or people who have their

167
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,880
brokerage accounts with these
banks, and essentially sell

168
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,460
them stock.

169
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,900
Say hey, you should buy Widgets
Inc, because it's only

170
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,160
trading at a Price to
Earnings of 10.

171
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,110
And we really like it.

172
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,520
It's much better than buying
treasury bonds right now,

173
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,965
because you're making
more money on it.

174
00:08:08,965 --> 00:08:12,840
You're making 10%, and that's
just to connect the dots.

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,830
Price to Earnings of 10.

176
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,760
If it's stable, you're making
the equity will grow in this

177
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
coming year by 10%.

178
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,340
And that's better than what you
get out of treasury bonds.

179
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,260
So that's what sell
side means.

180
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
So a sell side analyst
is someone who

181
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,890
publishes these reports.

182
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,020
A buy side analyst is someone
who works for a hedge fund or

183
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,860
works for Fidelity
at a mutual fund.

184
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,630
Or works for an endowment
or a pension someplace.

185
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,690
And they're managing other
people's money.

186
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,909
And they're trying to figure
out if they can

187
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,929
believe what's happening.

188
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,330
So they're going to do
their own analysis.

189
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,140
So that's what the
buy side is.

190
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,070
Those are the people who are
actually managing money and

191
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,360
deciding what they want to
invest the money in.

192
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,020
The sell side are the people who
do analysis and say, hey

193
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,330
due to my analysis isn't
this a good stock?

194
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,230
Don't you want to buy
or sell this stock?

195
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,820
So fair enough.

196
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,950
That was a bit of a diversion.

197
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,360
Anyway, going back to Price to
Earnings, we calculated the

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,020
Price to Earnings.

199
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,910
It was 10.

200
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,140
But the reason I wanted do to
Earnings to Price is because

201
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:13,430
it connects it back to things
like yield and interest. I can

202
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,120
do a Price to Earnings
on my bank account.

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,940
Let's say in my bank account
I have $100.

204
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,455
So this is a diversion
right here.

205
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:26,750
   

206
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,670
So let's say I have $100
in my bank account.

207
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,360
And over a year I make 2%
interest. Let's say it's

208
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,570
guaranteed 2%.

209
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,470
Maybe it's in the CD.

210
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,950
So I have $102 at the
end of the year.

211
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,960
This 2% were my earnings.

212
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,675
So I made $2 of earnings.

213
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:45,740
   

214
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,540
So the way to think about a bank
account is, well how much

215
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,790
do I pay for that
bank account?

216
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,560
Well in this case I paid $100
for the bank account.

217
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,860
So the price would be $100.

218
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,600
And the earnings on the
bank account in

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,930
that year were $200.

220
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,720
So it has a Price to
Earnings of 50.

221
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,970
Or if you do the Earnings
to Price, if you do

222
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,180
$2/$100, you get 2%.

223
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,920
Which is normally how we think
about bank accounts.

224
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,930
We say, oh I'm making 2%
interest on that bank account.

225
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,530
Now, this actually leads to a
very interesting question.

226
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:29,090
If a bank account only gives
me 2% on my money, and this

227
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,760
company is arguably giving me--
assuming that it's stable

228
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,980
and I believe the consensus--
it's giving me 10% on the

229
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,760
money, why would I even hold
this bank account?

230
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,750
Why wouldn't I just pour
all of my money?

231
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,160
Why am I willing to pay a higher
Price to Earnings for

232
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,310
the bank account than I
am for this company?

233
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,080
And I think you already get the
sense that the lower the

234
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,790
Price to Earnings, all else
equal-- and that's a big

235
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,230
thing-- all else equal, the
lower the Price to Earnings,

236
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,800
you're paying less
for something.

237
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,810
You want to have a lower
Price to Earnings ratio

238
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,870
for the same asset.

239
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,310
Because you're getting the same

240
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,430
earnings for a lower price.

241
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,110
But when you lower the Price to
Earnings you are increasing

242
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,950
the Earnings to Price.

243
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,210
So you would increase
your yield.

244
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,260
You want to maximize
this number.

245
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,900
But I'll finish this video with
kind of a basic question.

246
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,150
Why would someone ever keep
their money in the bank at 2%

247
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,715
or a Price to Earnings of 50,
when they could have a Price

248
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:30,010
to Earnings of 10 with
Widgets Inc.?

249
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,920
And the answer is because
this is very uncertain.

250
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,660
Who knows what happens
with Widgets Inc.?

251
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,220
Maybe all of these guys
were-- Maybe this

252
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,330
is a big Ponzi scheme.

253
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,770
I mean, most companies in
this country aren't.

254
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,730
And that's another thing to talk
about, is country risk.

255
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,440
Because even though you're
probably suspicious of them

256
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
now, the US has some of the
most transparent companies

257
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,130
with some of the best accounting
standards.

258
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,710
If this was in-- you know,
I don't want to state any

259
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,490
countries because people all
over the world listen to these

260
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,850
videos-- but if it were a
country with less solid

261
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,940
accounting standards, you would
be like, they might be

262
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,830
making up all of their numbers
so I don't trust it.

263
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,180
Or you might say, you know,
Widgets Inc., even though the

264
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,660
analysts are saying that they're
going to make $0.35

265
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,940
this coming year, you might
say, you know, I

266
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,590
don't believe that.

267
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,660
I think there's actually a lot
of risk in Widgets Inc. That

268
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,400
there's actually more volatility
here than anyone

269
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,170
gives credit for.

270
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,330
They might go out of business.

271
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,990
There's a strong competitor.

272
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,740
There's a lot of
risk involved.

273
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,950
And the other thing is,
even if you don't

274
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,510
think there's risk.

275
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,290
Even if you think that this
company's going to make $0.35

276
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,740
forever, the other reason why
you might prefer to have a

277
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,530
bank account over Widgets Inc.
is because you're guaranteed

278
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,250
to get $102 back for your bank
account at the end of the year

279
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:44,830
if you wanted.

280
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,950
Assuming this is a CD with
a one year duration.

281
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,880
You're guaranteed to get your
$102 back, especially if it's

282
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,300
FDIC insured.

283
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,980
But in this case, even though
the earnings might be the

284
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,610
same, something horrible might
happen to the markets and

285
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,930
everyone just dumps their
stocks, money flows just run

286
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,050
outside of markets.

287
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,530
And for whatever reason people
get scared, and the price

288
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,760
could go down a lot
from $3.50.

289
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
It could be very,
very volatile.

290
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,740
And this thing, maybe the price
goes from $3.50 to $1.75

291
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,520
a year later.

292
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,330
Which it seems like a really
good deal, because now the

293
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,310
Price to Earnings is $1.75
divided by $0.35, would now be

294
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,490
a 5 Price to Earnings.

295
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,330
But this could happen.

296
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,550
I mean, companies go from a 10
to a 5 Price to Earnings.

297
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,860
And then all of a sudden, if
you want that money, if you

298
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,540
need that money a year later,
you've lost half of it.

299
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,020
So there's some volatility in
the price even though you're

300
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,750
assuming that the earnings
are stable.

301
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,070
So that's a little bit of a
taste of why someone might

302
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,620
realistically, in this case, pay
a higher Price to Earnings

303
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,740
for safety.

304
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,180
Safety because you know that
this earnings stream is

305
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,020
guaranteed.

306
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,270
And liquidity.

307
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,940
Liquidity because you
know you're going to

308
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,860
get your money back.

309
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,930
That you're going to be able to
essentially sell your bank

310
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,340
account and get cash for it.

311
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,810
And you know that it's
going to be $100.

312
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,420
That there's no volatility
in price.

313
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,930
Well in this case, you're
uncertain about

314
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,160
the earnings stream.

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,320
You're uncertain about what the
market will be willing to

316
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,030
value it at a year later.

317
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,950
And frankly, you might
be uncertain about

318
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,870
liquidity in general.

319
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,080
Maybe this is a really small
company and not a lot of

320
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,150
people trade in it.

321
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,510
And you might not even be able
to find anyone to buy it a

322
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,360
year later.

323
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,290
The epitome of an illiquid
asset is maybe a really

324
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,490
expensive $20 million house.

325
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,910
Even though it might be worth
$20 million, a year later you

326
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:33,240
might not-- there are only so
many people who can afford a

327
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,630
$20 million house.

328
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,200
So it's an illiquid asset.

329
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,530
Anyway, I want to
leave you there.

330
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,330
In the next video we'll go into
more depth on Price to

331
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,320
Earnings ratio, and think about
things like growth and

332
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,650
stability and whatnot.

333
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,000
