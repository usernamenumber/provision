1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,140
What I want to do in this video
is use some of the results from

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,960
the last several videos to
do some pretty neat things.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,000
So let's say this is a circle,
and I have an inscribed

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,130
equilateral triangle
in this circle.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:17,340
So all the vertices of
this triangle sit on the

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,825
circumference of the circle.

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:24,170
So I'm going to try my best to
draw an equilateral triangle.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,960
I think that's about as good as
I'm going to be able to do.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,620
And when I say equilateral
that means all of these

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,910
sides are the same length.

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,060
So if this is side length a,
then this is side length a,

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,610
and that is also a
side of length a.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:44,010
And let's say we know that the
radius of this circle is 2.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,925
I'm just picking a number,
just to do this problem.

16
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:49,600
So let's say the radius
of this circle is 2.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,700
So from the center to the
circumference at any

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,910
point, this distance, the
radius, is equal to 2.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,780
Now, what I'm going to ask you
is using some of the results of

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,020
the last few videos and a
little bit of basic

21
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,940
trigonometry-- and if the word
"trigonometry" scares you,

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,570
you'll just need to know maybe
the first two or three videos

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,710
in the trigonometry playlist to
be able to understand

24
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,840
what I do here.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,830
What I want to do is figure out
the area of the region inside

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,080
the circle and outside
of the triangle.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,690
So I want to figure out the
area of that little space, that

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,940
space, and this space combined.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,490
So the obvious way to do
this is to say, well I can

30
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,670
figure out the area of
the circle pretty easily.

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,215
Area of the circle.

32
00:01:40,215 --> 00:01:43,740
And that's going to be
equal to pi r squared.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,840
Or pi times 2 squared,
which is equal to 4 pi.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,040
And I could subtract from 4
pi the area of the triangle.

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,450
So we need to figure out
the area of the triangle.

36
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,760
What is the area
of the triangle?

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,930
   

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,260
Well, from several videos ago I
showed you Heron's formula,

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,720
where if you know the lengths
of the sides of a triangle

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,070
you can figure out the area.

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,180
But we don't know the lengths
of the sides just yet.

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,560
Once we do maybe we can
figure out the area.

43
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,740
Let me apply Heron's
formula not knowing it.

44
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,950
So let me just say that the
lengths of this equilateral--

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,760
the lengths of the
sides-- are a.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,450
Applying Heron's formula, we
first define our variable

47
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,220
s as being equal to a
plus a plus a, over 2.

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,070
Or that's the same
thing as 3a over 2.

49
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,380
And then the area of this
triangle, in terms of a.

50
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,910
So the area is going to be
equal to the square root of

51
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,310
s, which is 3a over
2, times s minus a.

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,820
So that's 3a over 2 minus a.

53
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,060
Or I could just
write, 2a over 2.

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,970
Right? a is the same
thing as 2a over 2.

55
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,740
You could cancel
those out and get a.

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,170
And then I'm going to
do that three times.

57
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,000
So instead of just multiplying
that out three times for each

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
of the sides, by Heron's
formula I could just say

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,700
to the third power.

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,000
So what's this going
to be equal to?

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,050
This is going to be equal to
the square root of 3a over 2.

62
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,070
And then this right here
is going to be equal

63
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,810
to 3a minus 2a, is a.

64
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,010
So a/2 to the third power.

65
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,860
And so this is going to be
equal to-- I'll arbitrarily

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,490
switch colors.

67
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:53,560
We have 3a times a to the
third, which is 3a to the

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,170
fourth, over 2 times
2 to the third.

69
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,400
Well that's 2 to the
fourth power, or 16.

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Right?

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,100
2 times 2 to the third
is 2 to the fourth.

72
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,890
That's 16.

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,660
And then if we take the square
root of the numerator and the

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,150
denominator, this is going to
be equal to the square root of

75
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,690
a to the fourth is a squared.

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,390
a squared times, well I'll just
write the square root of 3,

77
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,860
over the square root of the
denominator, which is just 4.

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,130
So if we know a, using Heron's
formula we know what the area

79
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,720
of this equilateral
triangle is.

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,080
So how can we figure out a?

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,770
So what else do we know about
equilateral triangles?

82
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,690
Well we know that all of
these angles are equal.

83
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,720
And since they must add
up to 180 degrees, they

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,210
all must be 60 degrees.

85
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,890
That's 60 degrees,
that's 60 degrees, and

86
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,090
that is 60 degrees.

87
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,980
Now let's see if we can use the
last video, where I talked

88
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,720
about the relationship
between an inscribed angle

89
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
and a central angle.

90
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
So this is an inscribed
angle right here.

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,620
It's vertex is sitting
on the circumference.

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,630
And so it is subtending
this arc right here.

93
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,500
   

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,000
And the central angle that
is subtending that same arc

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,330
is this one right here.

96
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,880
   

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,740
The central angles subtending
that same arc is that

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,960
one right there.

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,170
So based on what we saw in the
last video, the central angle

100
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,980
that subtends the same arc is
going to be double of

101
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,040
the inscribed angle.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,230
So this angle right here is
going to be 120 degrees.

103
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,860
Let me just put an arrow there.

104
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,860
120 degrees.

105
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,440
It's double of that one.

106
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,110
Now, if I were to exactly
bisect this angle right here.

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,140
So I go halfway through the
angle, and I want to just go

108
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,260
straight down like that.

109
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,310
What are these two
angles going to be?

110
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,440
Well, they're going
to be 60 degrees.

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
I'm bisecting that angle.

112
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,480
That is 60 degrees, and that
is 60 degrees right there.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,450
And we know that I'm
splitting this side in two.

114
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,080
This is an isosceles triangle.

115
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,040
This is a radius right here.

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,030
Radius r is equal to 2.

117
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,530
This is a radius right
here of r is equal to 2.

118
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,090
So this whole triangle
is symmetric.

119
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,540
If I go straight down the
middle, this length right

120
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,100
here is going to be
that side divided by 2.

121
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,280
That side right there is going
to be that side divided by 2.

122
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,240
Let me draw that over here.

123
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,890
If I just take an isosceles
triangle, any isosceles

124
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,850
triangle, where this side is
equivalent to that side.

125
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,300
Those are our radiuses
in this example.

126
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,530
And this angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

127
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,790
If I were to just go straight
down this angle right

128
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,260
here, I would split that
opposite side in two.

129
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,880
So these two lengths
are going to be equal.

130
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,120
In this case if the whole
thing is a, each of these

131
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,140
are going to be a/2.

132
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,420
Now, let's see if we can use
this and a little bit of

133
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,620
trigonometry to find the
relationship between a and r.

134
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,050
Because if we're able to solve
for a using r, then we can then

135
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,640
put that value of a in here and
we'll get the area

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,690
of our triangle.

137
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,600
And then we could subtract
that from the area of the

138
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,070
circle, and we're done.

139
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,050
We will have solved
the problem.

140
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,610
So let's see if we can do that.

141
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,340
So we have an angle
here of 60 degrees.

142
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,050
Half of this whole central
angle right there.

143
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,890
If this angle is 60 degrees,
we have a/2 that's

144
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,380
opposite to this angle.

145
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,480
So we have an opposite
is equal to a/2.

146
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,860
And we also have
the hypotenuse.

147
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,040
Right?

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,870
This is a right
triangle right here.

149
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,830
You're just going straight
down, and you're bisecting

150
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,840
that opposite side.

151
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,640
This is a right triangle.

152
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,000
So we can do a little
trigonometry.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,550
Our opposite is a/2, the
hypotenuse is equal to r.

154
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,020
This is the hypotenuse, right
here, of our right triangle.

155
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,360
So that is equal to 2.

156
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,440
So what trig ratio is the
ratio of an angle's opposite

157
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,920
side to hypotenuse?

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,910
So some of you all might get
tired of me doing this all

159
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,030
the time, but SOH CAH TOA.

160
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,070
SOH-- sin of an angle is
equal to the opposite

161
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,620
over the hypotenuse.

162
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,580
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

163
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,270
I'm running out of space.

164
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,700
So the sin of this angle right
here, the sin of 60 degrees, is

165
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,070
going to be equal to the
opposite side, is going to be

166
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,800
equal to a/2, over the
hypotenuse, which is

167
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,140
our radius-- over 2.

168
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,510
Which is equal to a/2
divided by 2 is a/4.

169
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,880
And what is sin of 60 degrees?

170
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,720
And if the word "sin" looks
completely foreign to you,

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,150
watch the first several videos
on the trigonometry playlist.

172
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,240
It shouldn't be too daunting.

173
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,310
sin of 60 degrees you
might remember from your

174
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,680
30-60-90 triangles.

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,210
So let me draw one right there.

176
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,705
So that is a 30-60-90 triangle.

177
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:21,540
If this is 60 degrees, that
is 30 degrees, that is 90.

178
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,660
You might remember that this is
of length 1, this is going to

179
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,520
be of length 1/2, and this
is going to be of length

180
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,370
square root of 3 over 2.

181
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,300
So the sin of 60 degrees is
opposite over hypotenuse.

182
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,770
Square root of 3 over 2 over 1.

183
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,940
sin of 60 degrees.

184
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,840
If you don't have a calculator,
you could just use this--

185
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,930
is square root of 3 over 2.

186
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,890
So this right here is
square root of 3 over 2.

187
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,280
Now we can solve for a.

188
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,920
Square root of 3 over
2 is equal to a/4.

189
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,610
Let's multiply both sides by 4.

190
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,640
So you get this 4 cancels out.

191
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,445
You multiply 4 here.

192
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,480
This becomes a 2.

193
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,660
This becomes a 1.

194
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,250
You get a is equal to
2 square roots of 3.

195
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,000
We're in the home stretch.

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,420
We just figured out the length
of each of these sides.

197
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,460
We used Heron's formula to
figure out the area of the

198
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,080
triangle in terms
of those lengths.

199
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,110
So we just substitute this
value of a into there

200
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,670
to get our actual area.

201
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,380
So our triangle's area
is equal to a squared.

202
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,690
What's a squared?

203
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,780
That is 2 square roots
of 3 squared, times the

204
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,710
square root of 3 over 4.

205
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,470
We just did a squared times
the square root of 3 over 4.

206
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:51,950
This is going to be equal
to 4 times 3 times the

207
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,930
square of 3 over 4.

208
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,350
These 4's cancel.

209
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,360
So the area of our triangle
we got is 3 times the

210
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,770
square root of 3.

211
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,160
So the area here is 3
square roots of 3.

212
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,480
That's the area of
this entire triangle.

213
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,810
Now, to go back to what this
question was all about.

214
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,970
The area of this orange area
outside of the triangle

215
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,530
and inside of the circle.

216
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,460
Well, the area of
our circle is 4 pi.

217
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:23,340
And from that we subtract
the area of the triangle,

218
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,170
3 square roots of 3.

219
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,390
And we are done.

220
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,670
This is our answer.

221
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:35,270
This is the area of this
orange region right there.

222
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,800
Anyway, hopefully
you found that fun.

223
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,044
