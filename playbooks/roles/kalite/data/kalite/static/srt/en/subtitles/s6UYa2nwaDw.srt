1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,290
I'll now explain to you why,
from 2000 to 2005, we had very

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,390
low defaults on mortgages.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:14,490
Let's say that I buy a
house for $1 million.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,610
I buy a $1 million house.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,280
So let's say the bank
gives me $1 million.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,370
And then I'm willing to pay
a percentage on it.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,700
So this is from the bank.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,130
This is me.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,190
And I use that to buy a house.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,360
I don't know if these
diagrams help you.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,320
But you get the general idea.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,600
And the bank does that.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,330
And let's say, I don't know,
a year later I lose my job.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,340
I just can't pay this
mortgage anymore.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,420
So I have a couple of options.

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,920
I can either sell the house
and pay off the debt, or I

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,780
guess I could just tell the
bank, well I can't do

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,570
anything, and I'm going
to foreclose.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,760
And that would ruin my credit.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,440
It would hurt my credit.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,650
And I would lose all
my down payment.

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,470
So what are the circumstances
that I can sell the house?

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,650
Well, if I borrowed $1 million,
as long as-- and

25
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,940
let's say I didn't put any
money down, just for

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,190
simplicity.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,600
If I can sell the house for
$1.1 million, well I

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
would do it, right?

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,910
Let me sell for $1.1 million.

30
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,460
If I sell for $1.1 million,
I pay the bank--

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,760
let me switch colors.

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,900
I pay the bank $1 million,
and I net $100,000.

33
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,800
And everyone's happy.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,540
The bank got their money back,
so they didn't lose any money

35
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,690
on the transaction.

36
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,360
I made $100,000.

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,840
And so the whole reason why this
worked out, even though

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,970
maybe I was a credit risk,
is because the

39
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,970
housing prices went up.

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,050
So when you have rising housing
prices, the banks will

41
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,100
not lose money lending you.

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,270
Because if you can't pay, you
just give back the house, the

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,860
bank can sell it.

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,170
Or, you won't even give
back the house.

45
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,190
You'll sell the house and you'll
pay it off, even though

46
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,800
you can't pay the mortgage
anymore.

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
The only situation where I
would foreclose is if the

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,070
market price of the house
goes less than my loan.

49
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,320
And that's actually
the situation that

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
we're facing now.

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,340
So if, let's say that
I can only sell

52
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,400
this house for $900,000.

53
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,430
Well, then I'm just
going to give the

54
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,000
keys back to the bank.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,840
That's actually called jingle
mail, because you just mail

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,030
the keys back.

57
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,139
And then the bank sells the
house for $900,000.

58
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,610
And then they would
take a loss.

59
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,510
So when housing prices go
down, that's the only

60
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,810
situation where really you
should have foreclosure.

61
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,550
When housing prices soon. go up,
the person who borrowed it

62
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,700
is just going to sell the house
and pay off the loan.

63
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,070
And they are actually probably
going to make some money.

64
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,970
So there was every incentive
to buy a house.

65
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,390
So let's think about this whole
dynamic over the last

66
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,870
several videos that we've
been building.

67
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,210
   

68
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:42,300
So we said, from 2000 to 2004
housing prices went up.

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,180
   

70
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,530
Let me do it like this.

71
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,030
Let me change it a little bit.

72
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,950
   

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,160
We can even say, from
2000 to 2006.

74
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,300
So we know that housing
prices went up.

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,660
   

76
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,770
And why did why did housing
prices go up?

77
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,120
Well, we saw the data.

78
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,240
It wasn't because people
were earning more.

79
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,010
It wasn't because the
unemployment rate went down.

80
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,940
It wasn't because the population
increased.

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,840
It wasn't because the supply
of houses were limited.

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,830
We disproved all that.

83
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,830
We realize it was just because
financing got easier.

84
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:28,770
The standards for getting a
loan went lower and lower.

85
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,850
Financing got easier
and easier.

86
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,850
And because housing prices went
up, what did that cause?

87
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,150
We just said when housing
prices go up,

88
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,400
default rates go down.

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,760
   

90
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,330
You could give a
loan to someone

91
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,890
who's a complete deadbeat.

92
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,970
But as long as housing prices go
up, if they lose their job,

93
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,690
they can still sell that house
and pay you back the loan.

94
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,060
So housing prices going up
makes sure there's no

95
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,140
foreclosure, so defaults
go down.

96
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,950
So then the perceived risk
goes down, of lending.

97
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,390
   

98
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,360
Perceived lending
risk goes down.

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,029
   

100
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,040
So that makes more people
willing to lend.

101
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:31,240
   

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,450
And the corollary of more people
willing to lend, is you

103
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,410
that the actual standards
go down.

104
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,910
   

105
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,860
That's financing easier.

106
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,600
We could actually write that.

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,850
Standards go down.

108
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,990
   

109
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,320
So you had this whole-- I guess
you could argue whether

110
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,230
this is a negative or
a positive cycle.

111
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,720
But you had this whole cycle
occurring from the late '90s,

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,770
but especially, it really got
a lot of momentum at around

113
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,090
2001, 2002, 2003.

114
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,070
That financing got easier,
despite the fact that people

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,740
were earning less, population
wasn't increasing that fast,

116
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,920
that there were all of
these new houses.

117
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,170
And that caused housing
prices to go up.

118
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,850
Housing prices went up, then
we had a lot fewer people

119
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,300
defaulting on their loans.

120
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,050
No one would default on their
loans if they could sell it

121
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,630
for more than the loan.

122
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,420
Then a lot more people said,
well these are super safe.

123
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,910
And so the ratings agencies,
Standard and Poor's and

124
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,030
Moody's, were willing to give
AAA ratings to more and more,

125
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,030
what I would argue,
are risky loans.

126
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,070
So the perceived lending
risk went down.

127
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,920
Then more and more people
liked this asset class.

128
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,960
They said, wow, this is great.

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,650
I can get a better return than
I can get in a bank, or in

130
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,080
Treasuries, or in a whole set
of securities, even though

131
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,750
these are very low-risk
or perceived low-risk.

132
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,990
So I want to funnel more
and more money in here.

133
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,890
And so the mortgage brokers and
the investment banks said

134
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,080
great, the only way we can get
more volume to satisfy all

135
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,700
these people who want to lend
money-- the only way we can

136
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,150
find more people to lend
money to, is by

137
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,460
lowering the standards.

138
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,020
And this cycle went round
and round and round.

139
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,820
And it really started because
this whole process of being

140
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,970
able to take a bunch of people's
mortgages together,

141
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,630
package them up, and then turn
them into securities and then

142
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,270
sell them to a bunch of
investors-- this was a

143
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,630
quote-unquote innovation in the
mid-'90s, or early '90s.

144
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,810
I forgot exactly when.

145
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,670
And it really started to take
steam in the early part of

146
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,860
this decade.

147
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,000
So that's essentially why
housing prices went up.

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
And why kind of all of this
silliness happened.

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,270
And in the next video, I'll talk
a little bit more about

150
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,320
maybe who some of these
investors were.

151
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,300
And I'll tell you what a common
hedge fund technique.

152
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,980
And I think it's very important
not to group all

153
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,760
hedge funds together.

154
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,000
There are some good ones.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,270
But what a common hedge fund
technique was, to take

156
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,110
advantage of this virtual cycle,
to make the hedge fund

157
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,980
founders very wealthy.

158
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,450
I'll see

159
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:52,900
