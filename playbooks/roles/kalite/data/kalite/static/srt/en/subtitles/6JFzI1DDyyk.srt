1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,917
I realize I made a slight error in the last video,

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,790
when I talk about the population and the sample mean.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,170
So I will rewrite the equations.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,540
I realize I made a slight notational error,

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,700
and it might have confused you a little bit.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,870
So just to review a little bit, it never hurts.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,947
The mean of a population-- once again, that's mu--

8
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:21,443
the mean of a population is equal to,

9
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,945
you take the sum of each of the data points.

10
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:28,080
So you take the sum-- that's what that big sigma is for--

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,720
of each of the data points.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,880
So X sub i.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,880
I had written X sub n before, and if you review the last video,

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,750
you can see why it might be a little confusing.

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,500
And you start with the first data point.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,090
So i is equal to 1.

17
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,430
You start with the first data point,

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,105
and you take the sum all the way to the Nth data point,

19
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:47,854
where we have a big capital N,

20
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:51,250
where N is the total number of elements in the population.

21
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,690
And then you divide that by N.

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,560
So that's another way of writing X sub 1, plus X sub 2,

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,150
plus, and you just keep adding, bum bum bum,

24
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,745
however many there are. X sub N, and then you divide that by N.

25
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:07,930
And I think that's what you're familiar with

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,000
as just the arithmetic mean, or the average.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,501
You just add up all the elements

28
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,400
and you divide by the total number of elements there are.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,390
That's just a fancy way of writing that.

30
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,620
And then the sample mean is essentially the same thing,

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,330
although you use slightly different notation.

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,430
The sample mean is written as x with a line over it,

33
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,970
and that's equal to, once again, the sum of the elements in the sample.

34
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,770
And then you have just a slight notational difference.

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,753
You start at the first element in the sample

36
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,203
and you go to the number of elements in the sample.

37
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:41,820
And that's why they use that lowercase n.

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,740
There are big N elements in the whole population,

39
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,401
and if you took some subset of that--

40
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:51,280
we're assuming that small n is less than or equal to big N--

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,850
and you divide that by the total number of elements in the sample.

42
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,391
So once again, this would be x1 plus x2 plus dun dun dun,

43
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:05,230
plus x lowercase n divided by lowercase n.

44
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,200
These are essentially the same thing.

45
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,391
If your sample was the entire population,

46
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:10,972
then these n's would be equal to each other,

47
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:12,790
and these numbers would be equal to each other.

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,433
But just the notational difference,

49
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,780
if you ever see this, you know you're dealing with a sample.

50
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,070
Here you know you're dealing with the entire population.

51
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,080
And similarly, big N, entire population,

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,932
small n, the sample.

53
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,450
Fair enough.

54
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,120
I think we're now ready to learn a little bit about

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,220
measures of dispersion.

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,710
So the mean and the mode and the median that

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,166
we covered in the first video in this playlist,

58
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:38,781
were all ways of measuring the central tendency
of a data set,

59
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,508
or kind of picking a number that is

60
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:43,090
most representative of all the numbers.

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,280
But we lose a lot of information.

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,360
We don't know whether all of the numbers in the data set

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,402
are close to that number, close to the mean,

64
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:50,310
or maybe they're all really far away from the mean.

65
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,351
And that's why we want to come up with measures of dispersion.

66
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,450
And let me show you what I mean.

67
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,766
So let's say I have one set,

68
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:09,650
and let's say it is a 2, a 2, a 3, and a 3.

69
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,860
Let's say this is a population.

70
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,988
Let's just deal with population means

71
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,620
and population dispersions for now.

72
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,520
So what's the mean here?

73
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,027
The mean here is going to be 2 plus 2 plus 3 plus 3,

74
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,190
all of that over 4.

75
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,540
And what is that?

76
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,800
That's equal to 2 and 1/2 right?

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,040
4 plus 6 divided by 4, right?

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,660
That's equal to 2.5.

79
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,530
Fair enough.

80
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,540
Now what if we had this?

81
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:49,210
What if we had the numbers, I don't know, 0, 0, and 5, and 5.

82
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,310
So these are the numbers in the set.

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,604
I'll put commas

84
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:54,020
just so you know these are separate numbers.

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,700
What's that mean here?

86
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,920
Well the mean here-- and let's say this is the population.

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,870
This isn't a sample, this is the entire population.

88
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,480
And you'll see why I'm making that distinction later.

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,700
So it'll be 0 plus 0 plus 5 plus 5.

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,970
Well that's 10, divided by 4 is equal to 2.5.

91
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,960
So the arithmetic mean of both of these populations

92
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,020
are the same number.

93
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,280
They're both 2.5.

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,370
But you'll see that these sets are different.

95
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,100
Here all of the numbers are pretty close to 2.5, right?

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,490
While here, sure their mean, their arithmetic mean is 2.5,

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,660
but they're further away from 2.5.

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,292
Or the distances of each of these numbers,

99
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,291
each of the data, each of the numbers in the set,

100
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:43,780
their distance from the mean is further.

101
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,970
So you can kind of view them that they're more dispersed,

102
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,390
they're further away from the mean.

103
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,791
Or another way you can think of it is the mean,

104
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,434
although it does measure central tendency,

105
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:55,480
it's not quite as indicative of all the numbers.

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,740
The numbers are much further away from the mean on average.

107
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,230
So how do you measure that?

108
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,840
Well, you measure that with the variance.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,058
And this is something I've found,

110
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:08,190
it seems complicated when you first look at it.

111
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,870
And most statistics textbooks use fairly complex notation.

112
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,500
But the idea is almost as straightforward as

113
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,490
the arithmetic mean.

114
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,830
So what they'll do is they'll write the variance,

115
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,490
and they'll write it as this letter sigma, this Greek letter--

116
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,610
I wrote the top part too long.

117
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,480
Let me actually undo that.

118
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,535
I don't want you to spend the rest of your life

119
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,000
writing it with a big top part.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,180
They write it as sigma squared.

121
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,070
And we'll talk in a few seconds about why it's written as--

122
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,060
you know, why don't they just write v for variance?

123
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,160
Why do they write this weird letter squared?

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,570
I'll talk about that in a second.

125
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,680
But the variance of a population is defined--

126
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,550
and once again, these are just human derived constructs,

127
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,340
to kind of get our minds around data.

128
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,260
Being able to describe a set of data without having to list all the numbers,

129
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,220
and being able to kind of understand

130
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,210
what that data might represent, what can represent that data.

131
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,046
So what you do is, you take the sum,

132
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:08,320
and you start with all of the points in the population.

133
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,647
But instead of taking the sum of the points,

134
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:17,650
you take each point, X sub i, and you subtract from that--

135
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,230
and actually it doesn't matter if you subtract from that

136
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,310
or subtract that from-- the mean, the population mean.

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,530
And then you square it.

138
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,330
So what is this?

139
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,520
This is the distance between each number and the mean.

140
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,360
And when you square it, it becomes a positive number.

141
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,203
So you can kind of view it as just the squared absolute distance

142
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,818
between each number and the mean of that set.

143
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:41,410
And then you take the average of all of those,

144
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,880
and you divide that by N.

145
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,320
That might seem like a very complicated notion,

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,490
but let's calculate it for these two data sets.

147
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,670
So here, let me rewrite that first data set.

148
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,137
It's 2, 2, 3, and 3.

149
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,740
So...what is...actually let me write it this way.

150
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,830
This will help explain it for you a little bit better.

151
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:11,710
So if I wrote i-- i1, i2, i3, i4.

152
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,370
That's i.

153
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,340
Then X sub i.

154
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,650
It's kind of arbitrary, it's just saying the first term,

155
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,690
the second term, the third term.

156
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,940
I could have had this in any order; it doesn't matter.

157
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,750
Maybe this was the first term and this was the second

158
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,580
and this was the third.

159
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,560
It doesn't matter, because we're just going to

160
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,020
add them all up and then divide them.

161
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,670
So it doesn't matter what order we do it.

162
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:36,010
But anyway, X sub 1 is equal to 2.

163
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,440
X sub 2 is equal to 2.

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,160
X sub 3 is equal to 3.

165
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,070
I'll stop writing this equal thing. X sub 4 is equal to 4.

166
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,220
What's the mean?

167
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,630
Well, we figured out the mean up here.

168
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,550
We just took these numbers and added them and divided by 4.

169
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,647
The mean is 2.5.

170
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,620
So what is X sub i minus the mean?

171
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,360
We're slowly building up to this equation.

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,650
What is X sub i minus the mean?

173
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,410
Well, 2 minus 2.5, that's minus 0.5.

174
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,360
2 minus 2.5, that's once again minus 0.5.

175
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,380
3 minus 2.5, that's 0.5.

176
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,270
3 minus 2.5, that's 0.5.

177
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,770
Fair enough.

178
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,100
Now, this equation, they want us to square this.

179
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,540
So X sub i minus the mean squared.

180
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,250
And there's several other properties we'll talk about later,

181
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,360
but the most important thing that the squaring does--

182
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,830
and the absolute value could have done it as well--

183
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,630
but the squaring makes all of these positive.

184
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,570
So minus 0.5 squared is positive 0.25.

185
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,910
This is positive 0.25.

186
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,720
Plus 0.5 squared is also positive 0.25.

187
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,420
And this is positive 0.25.

188
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,803
So if we wanted to know the sum, from i is equal to 1 to 4,

189
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:10,920
of X sub i minus the mean, which is 2.5, squared.

190
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,620
This is equal to the sum of all of these numbers.

191
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,890
This is just saying sum all of these.

192
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,800
So sum all of these-- 0.25.

193
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,740
So that's equal to 1.

194
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,250
But this isn't the variance yet.

195
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,860
The variance is this thing--

196
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,090
let's look at the original formula--

197
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,483
The variance is this thing

198
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,550
divided by the total number of numbers you have.

199
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,000
So you take this.

200
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,402
So the variance is equal to this thing

201
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:37,710
divided by the total number of numbers, which is 4,

202
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,140
which is equal to 0.25.

203
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,997
And you see, here the distance from every number

204
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:48,030
the distance from every number to the mean squared was 0.25.

205
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,671
So the average of all of these--

206
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:54,130
which is essentially what the variance is--

207
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,975
the average was also 0.25.

208
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:55,820
And I'll do another example where these are different.

209
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,970
The other example in this video, actually,

210
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,850
they're not different.

211
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,740
But you see here, the average squared distance from the mean

212
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,200
in that first data set is 0.25.

213
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,100
And here what's the average squared distance from the mean?

214
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,420
So let's see.

215
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,560
This is how far from the mean.

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,990
So let's say X sub i,

217
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,210
and then X sub i minus the mean, for this population.

218
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,600
So X sub i, there's 0, there's a 0, there's a 5, and a 5.

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
This is the first term, X sub 1.

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,140
X sub 1, this is X sub 2, and so forth.

221
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,620
And then each of these numbers minus μ

222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,690
0 minus μ ...that's minus 2.5.

223
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,490
0 minus 2.5-- this could be 2.5, right?

224
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,620
That's the mean.

225
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,330
It's minus 2.5, 5 minus 2.5 is 2.5, 5 minus 2.5 is 2.5.

226
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,430
Now if you took X sub i minus the mean squared,

227
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,530
2.5 squared is what?

228
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,240
6.25, and it becomes positive.

229
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,130
So 6.25.

230
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,240
That's the same thing, 6.25.

231
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,210
That's already positive.

232
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,390
So 6.25, 6.25.

233
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,090
And so the variance is the sum of all of these

234
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,960
divided by the total number of numbers there are.

235
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,170
So we take the sum of all of them.

236
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,210
So it's just the average of these.

237
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,070
And that's pretty easy to calculate.

238
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,575
If you add all of these up and divide by 4,

239
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:24,620
you're just going to get 6.25.

240
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,260
So the variance of this population is 6.25.

241
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,080
So there you have it.

242
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,580
You have two data sets where their means are the same,

243
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,295
but the variance of this data set is equal to, we figured out it was 0.25,

244
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:44,872
while the variance of this data set is equal to 6.25.

245
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,350
And it's hard right now to have an intuition of

246
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,310
how does the 6 relate to the 0.25.

247
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,578
But you know that this is a larger number,

248
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,980
this is a much larger number than this is,

249
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,182
which tells you just kind of an intuitive feel that

250
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:00,314
the numbers in this set are, on average,

251
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:04,420
much further away from the mean than the numbers in this data set.

252
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,650
Anyway, I'm out of time.

253
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,490
I'll see you in the next video.

254
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,930
And we'll talk a little bit about this, and we'll move into

255
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,990
the standard deviation, and then what happens

256
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,550
if you take these of a sample instead of a population.

257
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,900
Everything we're doing here, we're taking the mean

258
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,890
and the variance of every number in the data set.

259
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,110
Later we'll do it for the sample.

260
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,212
See you soon.
