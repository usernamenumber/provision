1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,740
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm now going to do a bunch of
projectile motion problems,

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,800
and this is because I think
you learn more just seeing

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,610
someone do it, and thinking
out loud,

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,040
than all the formulas.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,570
I have a strange notion that I
might have done more harm than

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,700
good by confusing you with a lot
of what I did in the last

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,480
couple of videos, so hopefully
I can undo any damage if I

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,430
have done any, or even better--
hopefully, you did

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,530
learn from those, and we'll
just add to the learning.

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,350
Let's start with a
general problem.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,150
Let's say that I'm at the top
of a cliff, and I jump--

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,750
instead of throwing something,
I just jump off the cliff.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,770
We won't worry about my motion
from side to side, but just

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,060
assume that I go
straight down.

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,740
We could even think that someone
just dropped me off of

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,750
the top of the cliff.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,670
I know these are getting kind
of morbid, but let's just

19
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,120
assume that nothing
bad happens to me.

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,560
Let's say that at the top
of the cliff, my initial

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,160
velocity-- velocity initial-- is
going to be 0, because I'm

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,160
stationary before the person
drops me or before I jump.

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:16,740
At the bottom of the cliff
my velocity is

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,730
100 meters per second.

25
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,750
My question is, what is the
height of this cliff?

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,590
   

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,970
I think this is a good time
to actually introduce the

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,440
direction notion of
velocity, to show

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,200
you this scalar quantity.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,010
Let's assume up is positive,
and down is negative.

31
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,160
My velocity is actually 100
meters per second down-- I

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,720
could have assumed
the opposite.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,480
The final velocity is 100 meters
per second down, and

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,860
since we're saying that down
is negative, and gravity is

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,210
always pulling you down, we're
going to say that our

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,030
acceleration is equal to
gravity, which is equal to

37
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,935
minus 10 meters per
second squared.

38
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:06,000
   

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,120
I just wrote that ahead of
times, because when we're

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,780
dealing with anything of
throwing or jumping or

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,340
anything on this planet, we
could just use this constant--

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,950
the actual number is 9.81, but
I want to be able to do this

43
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,110
without a calculator, so I'll
just stick with minus 10

44
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,060
meters per second squared.

45
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,440
It's pulling me down, so that's
why the minus is there.

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,400
My question is: I know my
initial velocity, I know my

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,700
final velocity, right before I
hit the ground or right when I

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,420
hit the ground, what's
the distance?

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,770
   

50
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,010
In this circumstance, what
does distance represent?

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,060
Distance would be the height of
the cliff, and so how do we

52
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,310
figure this out?

53
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,400
   

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,470
What's the only formula that
we know for distance, or

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,090
actually the change in distance,
but in this case,

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,990
it's the same thing.

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,790
Change in distance is equal
to the average velocity.

58
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,650
When you learned this in middle
school, or probably

59
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,580
even elementary school, you
didn't say average velocity,

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,720
because you always assumed
velocity was constant-- the

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,990
average and the instantaneous
velocity was

62
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,560
kind of the same thing.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,100
Now, since the velocity is
changing, we're going to say

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,790
the average velocity.

65
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,350
So, the change in distance is
equal to the average velocity

66
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,210
times time.

67
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,020
This should be intuitive
to you at this point.

68
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,530
Velocity really is just distance
divided by time, or

69
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,290
actually, change in distance
divided by times change in

70
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,430
time-- or, change in
distance divided by

71
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,270
change in times is velocity.

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,406
Let me actually change this
to change in time.

73
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:35,030
   

74
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,145
Since we always assume-- or we
normally assume-- that we

75
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:42,870
start at distance is equal to 0,
and we assume that start at

76
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,380
time is equal to 0, we can write
distance is equal to

77
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,970
velocity average times time.

78
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,110
Maybe later on we'll do
situations where we're not

79
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,620
starting at time 0, or distance
0, and in that case,

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,680
we will have to be a little more
formal and say change in

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,915
distance is equal to average
velocity the change in time.

82
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:06,430
   

83
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,250
This is a formula we know,
and let's see what

84
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,580
we can figure out.

85
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,959
Can we figure out the
average velocity?

86
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,459
The average velocity is just
the average of the initial

87
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,940
velocity and the
final velocity.

88
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,500
The average velocity is just
equal to the average of these

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,520
two numbers: so, minus 100 plus
0 over 2-- and I'm just

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,230
averaging the numbers-- equals
minus 50 meters per second.

91
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,790
We were able to figure
that out, so can

92
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,040
we figure out time?

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,250
   

94
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,230
We know also that velocity,
or let's say the change in

95
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:57,020
velocity, is equal to the
final velocity minus the

96
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,400
initial velocity.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,640
This is nothing fancy-- you
don't have to memorize this.

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,390
This hopefully is intuitive to
you, that the change is just

99
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,755
the final velocity minus the
initial velocity, and that

100
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:12,380
that equals acceleration
times time.

101
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,920
So what's the change in velocity
in this situation?

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,815
Final velocity is minus 100
meters per second, and then

103
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,260
the initial velocity is 0, so
the change in velocity is

104
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,290
equal to minus 100 meters
per second.

105
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,030
I'm kind of jumping in and out
of the units, but I think you

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,780
get what I'm doing.

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,230
That equals acceleration
times time-- what's the

108
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:39,560
acceleration?

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,150
It's minus 10 meters per second
squared, because I'm

110
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,920
going straight down-- minus 10
meters per second squared

111
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,550
times time.

112
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,365
This is a pretty straightforward
equation.

113
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:54,400
Let's divide both sides by the
acceleration, by the minus 10

114
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,160
meters per second squared, and
you'll get time is equal to--

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,870
the negatives cancel out, as
they should, because negative

116
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,290
time is difficult, we're
assuming positive time, and

117
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,630
it's good we got a positive
time answer-- but the

118
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,410
negatives cancel out
and we get time

119
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,620
is equal to 10 seconds.

120
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,560
There we have it: we figured out
time, we figured out the

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,030
average velocity, and so now we
can figure out the height

122
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,110
of the cliff.

123
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,200
The distance is equal to the
average velocity minus 50

124
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,690
meters per second times
10 seconds.

125
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,210
The distance-- this is going to
be an interesting notion to

126
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:45,240
you-- the distance it's going
to be minus 500 meters.

127
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,930
This might not make a lot of
sense to you-- what does minus

128
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,510
500 meters mean?

129
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,660
This is actually right, because
this formula is

130
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,910
actually the change
in distance.

131
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,780
   

132
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,680
We said if we did it formally,
it would be

133
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,900
the change in distance.

134
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,470
So if we have a cliff-- let me
change colors with it-- and if

135
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,780
we assume that we start at this
point right here, and

136
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:21,390
this distance is equal to 0,
then the ground, if this cliff

137
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,855
is 500 hundred meters high, your
final distance-- this is

138
00:07:24,855 --> 00:07:29,140
the initial distance-- your
final disstance df is actually

139
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,760
going to be at minus
500 hundred meters.

140
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,136
We could have done it the other
way around: we could

141
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:37,930
have said this is plus 500
meters, and then this is 0,

142
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,010
but all that matters is really
the change in distance.

143
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,240
We're saying from the top of the
cliff to the ground, the

144
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,260
change in distance is
minus 500 meters.

145
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,250
And minus, based on our
convention, we said minus is

146
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,990
down, so the change is 500
meters down, and that's height

147
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,380
of the cliff.

148
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,370
That's pretty interesting.

149
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:04,160
If you go to a 500 meter cliff--
500 is about 1,500

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
feet-- so that's roughly the
size of maybe a very tall

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,480
skyscraper, like the
World Trade Center

152
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,440
or the Sears Tower.

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,860
If you jump off of something
like that, assuming no air

154
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,930
resistance, which is a big
assumption, or if you were to

155
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,110
drop a penny-- because a penny
has very little air

156
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,330
resistance-- if you were to drop
a penny off of the top of

157
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,800
Sears Tower or a building like
that, at the bottom it will be

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,600
going 100 meters per second.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,130
That's extremely fast, and
that's why you shouldn't be

160
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,520
doing it, because that is fast
enough to kill somebody, and I

161
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,830
don't want to give you any bad
ideas if you're a bad person.

162
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,710
It's just interesting that
physics allows you to solve

163
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,950
these types of problems.

164
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,760
In the next presentation, I'm
just going to keep doing

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,090
problems, and hopefully you'll
realize that everything really

166
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,880
just boils down to average
velocity-- change in velocity

167
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,830
is acceleration times time,
and change in distance is

168
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,380
equal to change in time times
average velocity, which we all

169
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,180
did just now.

170
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,940
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
