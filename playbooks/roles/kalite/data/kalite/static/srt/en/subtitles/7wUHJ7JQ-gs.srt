1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,410
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,400
I'm just continuing on with
hopefully giving you, one, how

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,660
to actually solve indefinite
integrals and also giving you a

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,950
sense of why you solve
it the way you do.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,150
And I think that's often
missing in some textbooks.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,780
But anyway, let's say that this
is the distance and let me give

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,250
you a formula, actually, for
the distance, just for fun.

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,200
Oh, my phone is ringing.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,590
Let me lower the volume,
because you're more important.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,610
So, let's say that the
distance, s -- this time I'll

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,845
write it as a function -- let's
say the distance is -- I said

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:40,220
it started at five, so let's
say it's 2t -- let's say this

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,440
is actually a cubic function.

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,290
You're not only accelerating,
your rate of acceleration

16
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:47,970
is increasing.

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,300
I think, actually, the rate
of acceleration, if I'm not

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,340
mistaken, is actually called
jerk, but I might have

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,330
to Wikipedia that.

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,690
Let's say its 2t to
the third plus 5.

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,240
   

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:08,980
And let's say I wanted to know
how far I travel between t

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:17,540
equals 2 seconds and
t equals 5 seconds.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,100
Right?

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,130
I'm not looking for the total
distance I've traveled.

26
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,570
I just want to know how far do
I travel between time equals 2

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,790
seconds and time
equal 5 seconds.

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,040
Right?

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,610
So this might be
2 and this is 5.

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,082
So an easy way to do that is
I could just evaluate this

31
00:01:33,082 --> 00:01:36,920
function at t equals 5 -- let
me use a different color.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,750
I think it's getting messy --
I could just evaluate this

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,910
function at t equals 5.

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,890
   

35
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:53,200
If t equals 5, 5 to the third
power is 125, 250, it's 255,

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,640
so the object has gone 255
feet at t equals 5, right?

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,070
And then, at time equals 2,
the object has gone how far?

38
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,110
2 to the third is 8.

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,550
16.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,180
It's gone 21 feet.

41
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,590
Right?

42
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,450
To figure out how far I
travelled between time equals 2

43
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,720
and time equals 5, I just say s
of 5 minus s of 2, right?

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,825
How far did I go after 5
seconds minus how far I

45
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:24,000
already was after 2 seconds.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,520
And this is just 255 minus
21 and that's, what, 234.

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,480
234 feet is how far I
travelled between 2

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,070
seconds and 5 seconds.

49
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,040
Interesting.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,950
And I think you're starting to
get a little intuition about

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,420
why we evaluated that previous
indefinite integral in the

52
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,120
previous video the way we did.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,820
So let's actually draw the
derivative of this function.

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,220
So what's the derivative?

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,950
So let me just call
that v of t, I guess.

56
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,690
v of t is just the derivative,
right, because it's the rate

57
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,420
of change of distance
with respect to time.

58
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,530
3 times 2 is 6t squared and the
constant disappears, right?

59
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,010
So it's just 6t squared.

60
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,140
And that makes sense, right?

61
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,010
Because your velocity doesn't
care about where you

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,500
started off from, right?

63
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,210
You're going to be the same
velocity if you started

64
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,010
from 10 feet or if you
started from 2 feet.

65
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,520
Your velocity doesn't really
matter about where your

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,710
starting position is.

67
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,420
So let's graph this.

68
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,570
See?

69
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,250
You're actually learning
a little physics while

70
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,310
you're learning calculus.

71
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,800
Actually, I think it's silly
that they're taught as

72
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,630
two separate classes.

73
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,060
I think physics and calculus
should just be one

74
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,960
fun 2-hour class.

75
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,330
But I'll talk about
that at another time.

76
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,040
   

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,100
So, going back to this.

78
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,730
Let me graph that.

79
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,090
6t squared.

80
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,120
Well, that's just going
to look like a parabola.

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,110
Right?

82
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,440
It's going to look
something like this.

83
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,970
This is t.

84
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,090
This is the velocity.

85
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,990
And now, if we just had this
velocity graph, if we didn't

86
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:57,320
know all of this over
here and I asked you the

87
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,070
same question, though.

88
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,370
I said, how far does this
thing travel between 2

89
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,420
seconds and 5 seconds?

90
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:08,815
Right?

91
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,270
   

92
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,990
Well, I could do it the way
that we learned in the previous

93
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,230
video where I draw a bunch of
small rectangles, each of a

94
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,530
really small width, and I
multiply it times its

95
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,565
instantaneous velocity at
that exact moment, right?

96
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:30,630
   

97
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,350
And then I sum up all of those
rectangles -- look how pretty

98
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,350
that is -- I sum up all
of the rectangles.

99
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,930
And I'll get a pretty good
approximation for how far

100
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,850
I've travelled between
2 and 5 seconds.

101
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,070
Because remember, the area of
each of these rectangles

102
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,960
represents how far I
traveled in that little

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
amount of time, dt.

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,310
Because time times a constant
velocity is equal to distance.

105
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:17,480
But as you can see this also
tells me the area between

106
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,130
t equals 2 and t equals 5.

107
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,440
So, not only did I figure out
the distance between how far I

108
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,280
traveled from 2 seconds to 5
seconds, I also figured out the

109
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,060
area under this curve from
2 seconds to 5 seconds.

110
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,580
So, interestingly enough, if I
just changed this from a to b,

111
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,920
and, in general, if you want to
figure out the area under a

112
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:51,680
curve from a to b, it's just
the indefinite integral from a

113
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,790
to b -- actually, from b to a.

114
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,650
The b should be the larger one.

115
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,920
b to a.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,090
I guess a to b, depending
on how you say it.

117
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,360
Let me write that in a
different color because I

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,100
think I'm making it messier.

119
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,950
From a to b of this
velocity function.

120
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,460
So, in this case, 6t
squared d t, right?

121
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,200
If these weren't 2 and 5,
if this was just a and b.

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,370
And the way you evaluate this
is you figure out the

123
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,760
antiderivative of this inside
function, and then you evaluate

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,010
the antiderivative at b,
and then from that, you

125
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,040
subtract it out at a.

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,590
So in this case, the
antiderivative of this is 2t to

127
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:40,900
the third and we evaluated at
b, and we evaluated at a.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,770
Actually, let me stick
to the old numbers.

129
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,510
We evaluated it at 5 and
you evaluated it at 2.

130
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,240
So if you evaluated
it at 5, that's 255.

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,750
If you evaluate it
at 2, that's 21.

132
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,020
So you're doing the exact same
thing we did here when we

133
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,480
actually had this graph.

134
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,560
So I did all of this, not to
confuse you further, but really

135
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,580
just to give you an intuition
of why one, why the

136
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,290
antiderivative is the area
under the curve, and then two,

137
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:21,390
why-- let's say that a, b-- and
then why we evaluate

138
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,560
it this way.

139
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,950
You might see this
in your books.

140
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,040
   

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,560
This is just saying, if I want
to figure out the area under a

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,820
curve from a to b of f of
x, that we figure out

143
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,600
the antiderivative.

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,660
This capital F is just
the antiderivative.

145
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,740
We just figure out the
antiderivative and we evaluated

146
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,940
at b and we evaluated at a, and
then we subtract

147
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,540
the difference.

148
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,680
And that's what we
did here, right?

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,150
This is what we did here
intuitively when we

150
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,110
worked with distance.

151
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,220
The derivative and the
antiderivative don't only apply

152
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,020
to distance and velocity.

153
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,870
But I did this to give you an
intuition of why this works

154
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,690
and why the antiderivative
is the area under a curve.

155
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,710
So let me clear this up and
just rewrite that last thing

156
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,490
I wrote, but maybe a
little bit cleaner.

157
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,680
   

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,650
OK.

159
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:24,380
So let's say that F of x with a
big, fat capital F is equal to

160
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,440
-- actually, let me do it a
better way -- let me say that

161
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,930
the derivative of big fat F
of x is equal to f of x.

162
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,200
Right?

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,920
I think, actually, this is the
fundamental theorem of

164
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,450
calculus, but I don't want to
throw out things without

165
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:43,920
knowing for sure.

166
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,170
I have to go make sure.

167
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,770
See, I haven't done
math in a long time.

168
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,230
I'm giving you all this based
on intuition, not necessarily

169
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,400
what I'm reading.

170
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,020
So the derivative of big F is
small f, and all we're saying

171
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:06,470
is that if we take the integral
of small f of x from a to b,

172
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:13,480
dx, that this is big F, it's
antiderivative, at b minus

173
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,320
the antiderivative at a.

174
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,190
In the next presentation,
I'll use this.

175
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,846
This is actually pretty easy
to use once you know how

176
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:20,580
to use antiderivatives.

177
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,990
And we did these three videos
really just to give you -- or

178
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,165
actually, is this the third or
the second -- just to give you

179
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,720
an intuition of why this is,
because I think that's really

180
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,830
important if you're ever going
to really use calculus in your

181
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,160
life or write a computer
program or whatever.

182
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,280
And in the next couple videos
I'll actually apply this to a

183
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,640
bunch of problems and you'll
hopefully see that it's a

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,860
pretty straightforward
thing to actually compute.

185
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,880
I'll see you in the
next presentation.

186
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,200
