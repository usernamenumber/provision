1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,020
So far, we've used integrals
to figure out the

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,950
area under a curve.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,320
And let's just review a little
bit of the intuition, although

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,830
this should hopefully be second
nature to you at this point.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,720
If it's not, you might want
to review the definite

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,360
integration videos.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,280
But if I have some function--
this is the xy plane, that's

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,300
the x-axis, that's the y-axis--
and I have some function.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,430
Let's call that, you know,
this is y is equal to

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,660
some function of x.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,750
Give me an x and
I'll give you a y.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,740
If I wanted to figure out the
area under this curve, between,

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,910
let's say, x is equal to
a and x is equal to b.

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,980
So this is the area I
want to figure out.

15
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,870
17
00:00:46,87 --> 00:00:50,87
What I do is, I split it up
into a bunch of columns

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,890
or a bunch of rectangles.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,510
Where-- let me draw one of
those rectangles-- where you

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,610
could view-- and there's
different ways to do this,

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,330
but this is just a review.

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,080
Where you could review-- that's
maybe 1 of the rectangles.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,720
Well, the area of the
rectangle is just base

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,530
times height, right?

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,360
Well, we're going to make these
rectangles really skinny and

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,100
just sum up an infinite
number of them.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,340
So we want to make them
infinitely small.

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,060
But let's just call the
base of this rectangle dx.

27
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,590
And then the height of this
rectangle is going to be

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,620
f of x, at that point.

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,545
It's going to be f of-- if this
is x0, or whatever, you can

30
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:25,690
just call it f of x, right?

31
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,170
That's the height
of that rectangle.

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,470
And if we wanted to take
the sum of all of these

33
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,090
rectangles-- right?

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,210
There's just going to
be a bunch of them.

35
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,160
One there, one there.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,910
Then we'll get the area, and if
we have infinite number of

37
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,860
these rectangles, and they're
infinitely skinny, we

38
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,840
have exactly the area
under that curve.

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,160
That's the intuition behind
the definite integral.

40
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,140
And the way we write that--
it's the definite integral.

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,300
We're going to take the sums of
these rectangles, from x is

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,490
equal to a, to x is equal to b.

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,120
And the sum, or the areas that
we're summing up, are going to

44
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,770
be-- the height is f of x,
and the width is d of x.

45
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,580
It's going to be f
of x times d of x.

46
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,970
This is equal to the
area under the curve.

47
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,630
f of x, y is equal to f
of x, from x is equal to

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,040
a to x is equal to b.

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,440
And that's just a
little bit of review.

50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,720
But hopefully, you'll now
see the parallel of how we

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,250
extend this to taking the
volume under a surface.

52
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,670
So first of all,
what is a surface?

53
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,130
Well, if we're thinking
in three dimensions, a

54
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,540
surface is going to be
a function of x and y.

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,060
So we can write a surface as,
instead of y is a function

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,930
of f and x-- I'm sorry.

57
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,060
Instead of saying that y is a
function of x, we can write a

58
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,810
surface as z is equal to
a function of x and y.

59
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,270
So you can kind of view
it as the domain.

60
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,460
Right?

61
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,030
The domain is all of the set
of valid things that you

62
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,200
can input into a function.

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,690
So now, before, our domain was
just-- at least, you know, for

64
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,070
most of what we dealt with--
was just the x-axis, or kind of

65
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,640
the real number line
in the x direction.

66
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,580
Now our domain is the xy plane.

67
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,040
We can give any x and any y--
and we'll just deal with the

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,740
reals right now, I don't
want to get too technical.

69
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,480
And then it'll pop out another
number, and if we wanted to

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,950
graph it, it'll be our height.

71
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,970
And so that could be the
height of a surface.

72
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,960
So let me just show you what
a surface looks like, in

73
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
case you don't remember.

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,360
And we'll actually figure out
the volume under this surface.

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
So this is a surface.

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,140
I'll tell you its function
in a second, but it's

77
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,370
pretty neat to look at.

78
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,400
But as you can see,
it's a server.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,760
It's like a piece of
paper that's bent.

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,870
Let's see, let me rotate it
to its traditional form.

81
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,485
So this is the x direction,
this is the y direction.

82
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:43,120
And the height is a function of
where we are in the xy plane.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,880
So how do we figure out
the volume under a

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,970
surface like this?

85
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,540
How do we figure
out the volume?

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,810
It seems like a bit of a
stretch, given what we've

87
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,500
learned from this.

88
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,300
But what if-- and I'm just
going to draw an abstract

89
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,186
surface here-- let
me draw some axis.

90
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:03,730
Let's see, that's my x-axis.

91
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,390
94
00:04:06,39 --> 00:04:09,072
That's my y-axis.

92
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,650
That's my z-axis.

93
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,970
I don't practice these videos
ahead of time, so I'm often

94
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,590
wondering what I'm
about to draw.

95
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,960
OK.

96
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,420
So that's x, that's
y, and that's z.

97
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,990
And let's say I
have some surface.

98
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,350
I'll just draw something.

99
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,380
I don't know what it is.

100
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,050
Some surface.

101
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,090
This is our surface.

102
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,300
z is a function of x and y.

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,470
So, for example, you give me a
coordinate in the xy plane.

104
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,360
Say, here, I'll put it into
the function and it'll

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,630
give us a z value now.

106
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,290
And I'll plot it there
and it'll be a point

107
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,440
on the surface.

108
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,250
So what we want to figure
out is the volume

109
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,990
under the surface.

110
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,670
And we have to specify
bounds, right?

111
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,330
From here, we said x is equal
to a, to x is equal to b.

112
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,030
So let's make a square
bound first, because this

113
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,610
keeps it a lot simpler.

114
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,150
So let's say that the domain or
the region-- not the domain--

115
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,770
the region of-- the x and y
region of this part of the

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,800
the surface, the shadow
would be right there.

117
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,530
Let me try my best to
draw this neatly.

118
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,110
So this is what we're
going to try to figure

119
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,240
out the volume of.

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,490
And let's say-- so, if we
wanted to draw it in the xy

121
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,950
plane, like you can kind of
view the projection of the

122
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,980
surface of the xy plane,
or the shadow of the

123
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,240
surface of the xy plane.

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,450
What are the bounds?

125
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,470
You can almost view-- what are
the bounds of the domain?

126
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,650
Well, let's say that this
point-- let's say that this

127
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,340
right here, that's 0,
0 in the xy plane.

128
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,470
Let's say that this is y is
equal to-- I don't know,

129
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,780
that's y is equal to a.

130
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,010
That's this line right here.

131
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,370
Y is equal to a.

132
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,940
And let's say that this line
right here is x is equal to b.

133
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,910
Hope you get that, right?

134
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,230
This is the xy plane.

135
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,080
If we have a constant x, it
would be a line like that.

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,740
A constant y, a line like that.

137
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,370
And then we have the
area in between it.

138
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,080
So how do we figure out
the volume under this?

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,130
Well, if I just wanted to
figure out the area of--

140
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,310
let's just say, this sliver.

141
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,560
Let's say we had a--
well, actually let

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,950
me go the other way.

143
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,570
Let's say we had a constant y.

144
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,060
So let's say I had some sliver.

145
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,100
I don't want to confuse you.

146
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,980
Let's say that I had
some constant y.

147
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,020
I just want to give
you the intuition.

148
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,810
You know, let's say.

149
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,620
I don't know what that is.

150
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,665
It's an arbitrary y.

151
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:47,820
But for some constant y, what
if I could just figure out the

152
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,810
area under the curve there?

153
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,130
How would I figure out just
the area under that curve?

154
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,210
It'll be a function of
which y I pick, right?

155
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,050
Because if I pick a y here,
it'll be a different area.

156
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,280
If I pick a y there, it'll
be a different area.

157
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,790
But I could view this now
as a very similar problem

158
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,560
to this one up here.

159
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,265
I could have my dx's-- let
me pick a vibrant color

160
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,530
so you can see it.

161
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,930
Let's say that's dx, right?

162
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,760
That's a change in x.

163
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:27,940
And then the height is going
to be a function of the x

164
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,440
I have and the y I picked.

165
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,990
So what would be the area
of this sheet of paper?

166
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,100
It's kind of a constant y.

167
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,390
It's part of-- it's a sheet
of paper within this volume,

168
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,990
you can kind of view it.

169
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,750
Well, it would be-- we said
the height of each of these

170
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,030
rectangles is f of xy, right?

171
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,515
That's the height.

172
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:03,270
It depends which x and
y we pick down here.

173
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,120
And then if we integrated it,
from x is equal to 0, which was

174
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,530
back here, all the way to x
is equal to b, what

175
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,006
would it look like?

176
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:20,600
It would look like that.
x is going from 0 to b.

177
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,120
Fair enough.

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,220
And this would actually
give us a function of y.

179
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,290
This would give us an
expression so that I would know

180
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,670
the area of this kind of sliver
of the volume, for any

181
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,690
given value of y.

182
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,300
If you give me a y, I can tell
you the area of the sliver

183
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,680
that corresponds to that y.

184
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,720
Now what could I do?

185
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,110
If I know the area of any given
sliver, what if I multiply the

186
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,680
area of that sliver times dy?

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,660
This is a dy.

188
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,650
Let me do it in a
vibrant color.

189
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,180
So dy, a very small
change in y.

190
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,430
If I multiplied this area
times a small dy, then

191
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,970
all of a sudden I have
a sliver of volume.

192
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,840
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

193
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,970
I'm making that-- that little
cut that I took the area of--

194
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,800
by making it three dimensional.

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,490
So what would be the
volume of that sliver?

196
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,820
The volume of that sliver will
be this function of y times dy,

197
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,280
or this whole thing times dy.

198
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:31,910
So it would be the integral
from 0 to b of f of xy dx.

199
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,670
That gives us the area
of this blue sheet.

200
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,130
Now if I multiply this
whole thing times dy,

201
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,710
I get this volume.

202
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,150
It gets some depth.

203
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,150
This little area that I'm
shading right here gets

204
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,010
depth of that sheet.

205
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,650
Now if I added all of those
sheets that now have depth, if

206
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,130
I took the infinite sum-- so if
I took the integral of this

207
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:04,120
from my lower y bound-- from 0
to my upper y bound, a, then--

208
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,860
at least based on our intuition
here-- maybe I will have

209
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,110
figured out the volume
under this surface.

210
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,690
But anyway, I didn't
want to confuse you.

211
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,670
But that's the intuition of
what we're going to do.

212
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,140
And I think you're going to
find out that actually

213
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,840
calculating the volumes are
pretty straightforward,

214
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,660
especially when you have
fixed x and y bounds.

215
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,510
And that's what we're going
to do in the next video.

216
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,012
See you soon.
