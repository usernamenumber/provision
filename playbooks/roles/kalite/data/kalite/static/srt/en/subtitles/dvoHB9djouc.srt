1
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:06,709
Lets say I'm trying to judge how many years of experience we have at the Khan Academy

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:10,693
Or on average how many years of experience we have, and in particular, the particular

3
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:13,714
type of average we'll focus on is the arithmetic mean.

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:18,647
So I go and I survey the folks there, and let's say this is when, Khan academy was a smaller organization

5
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:24,255
when there were only five people in the organization, and I find, and I'm surveying the entire population

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:28,975
So years of experience, the entire population of Khan academy, because that's what I care about

7
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:34,701
Years of experience at our organization- at Khan Academy, and this is when we had 5 people-

8
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,527
And I were to go, we're now 36 people, I don't wanna date this video too much,

9
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:41,780
but let's say I go and I say "ok there's one person straight out of college

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,703
that one year of experience, or recently out of college, somebody with three years of experience,

11
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:50,638
someone with five years of experience, someone with seven year of experience,

12
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:56,126
and someone very experienced, or reasonably experienced with 14 years of experience

13
00:00:56,126 --> 00:01:01,178
So based on this data point, and this is our population for years of experience, so I'm assuming that we only have

14
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:06,882
five people at the organization at this point, what would be the population

15
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:13,355
mean for the years of experience, what is the mean years of experience for my population

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:19,033
well we can just calculate that, our mean years of experience, and I'm going to

17
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:22,800
denote it with mu, because we're talking about the population now, this is a parameter

18
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:29,386
for the population, its going to be equal to the sum from our first data point,

19
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:35,667
so data point one, all the way to data point, in this case, data point five

20
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:42,908
we have five data points, of each of - so we're gonna take all five from the first data point,

21
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:45,333
the second data point, the third data point, all the way to the fifth,

22
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:50,641
so this is going to be equal to x1 plus, oh no I'm going to divide it all by the number of data points I have

23
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:58,381
plus x2 plus x3 plus x4 plus x sub 5

24
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:03,058
all of that over five, and as we said this is a very fancy way of saying "I'm going to sum up all

25
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:09,133
these things and then divide by the number of things we have," so let's do that

26
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:23,103
Get the calculator out, so I'm going to add them all up, one plus three plus five, plus seven plus fourteen,

27
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:28,736
so that's five data points and I'm gonna divide by five, and I get six

28
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:36,178
So the population mean for years of experience at my organization is six, six years of experience

29
00:02:36,178 --> 00:02:41,877
Well that's, I guess interesting, but now I wanna ask another question, I wanna get some

30
00:02:41,877 --> 00:02:47,856
measure of how much spread there is around that mean, or how much do the data points

31
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:50,984
vary around that mean, and obviously I can give someone all the data points

32
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:54,462
but instead I wanna come up with a parameter that somehow represents how much

33
00:02:54,477 --> 00:03:01,983
all of these things on average are varying from this number right here, or maybe I

34
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:09,963
will call that thing the 'variance', so the variance

35
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:15,087
this is a population variance that I'm talking about, just to be clear, it's a parameter

36
00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:26,221
The population variance I'm going to denote with the Greek letter Sigma, lowercase sigma squared

37
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:32,604
And I'm going to say, well I'm gonna take the distance from each of these points to the mean, and just

38
00:03:32,604 --> 00:03:37,439
so I get a positive value I'm going to square it and then I'm gonna divide by the number of data points

39
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:43,076
so essentially I'm gonna find the average squared distance, now that might sound very complicated

40
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:50,462
but let's actually work it out, so I'll take my first data point, I'll take that data point and I will subtract

41
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:54,768
our mean from it, so this is going to give me a negative number, but if I square it's going to be

42
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:59,915
positive, so essentially it's going to be the squared distance between one and my mean,

43
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:07,311
and then to that I'm going to add the squared distance between three and my mean

44
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:14,507
And to that I'm going to add the squared distance between five and my mean,

45
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:17,987
and since I'm squaring it doesn't matter if I do five minus six or six minus five

46
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:20,664
when I square it I'm going to get a positive result regardless

47
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:27,908
and then to that I'm going to add the squared distance between seven and my mean, so seven minus six squared

48
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:31,589
all of this, this is my population mean that I'm finding the difference between

49
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:42,728
and then finally, the squared difference between 14 and my mean, and then

50
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:47,516
I'm going to find essentially the mean of these squared distances, so I have five squared

51
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:56,364
distances right over here, so let me divide by five

52
00:04:56,364 --> 00:05:01,943
so what will I get when I make this calculation right over here.

53
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:13,346
Well let's figure this out, this is going to be equal to (1-6) is negative 5, negative 5 squared is 25

54
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,705
(3-6) is negative 3, if I square that I get nine

55
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:21,905
(5-6) is negative one, if square it I get positive 1

56
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:26,402
(7-6) is 1, if I square it I get positive 1

57
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:36,669
and (14-6) is 8, if I square it I get 64, then I'm gonna divide all of that by 5.

58
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,748
And I don't need to use a calculator but I tend to make a lot of careless mistakes when I do things

59
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:55,661
while I'm making a video, so I get: 25+9+1+1+64 divided by 5 so I get 20

60
00:05:55,661 --> 00:06:01,873
So the average squared distance, or the mean squared distance from our population mean

61
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:10,672
is equal to 20, you might say "wait these aren't 20 away," remember it's squared distance away

62
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:15,775
from my population mean so I squared each of these things I like to because I made it positive, and

63
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:21,454
we'll see later it has other nice properties about it, now the last thing is - how can we represent this

64
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:27,482
mathematically? We already saw that we know how to represent a population mean and a sample mean

65
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:31,521
mathematically like this, and hopefully we don't find it that daunting anymore

66
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:38,393
but how would we do the exact same thing, how would we denote what we did right over here

67
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:44,578
Well let's just think it through, we're just saying that the population variance,

68
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:53,232
we're taking the sum of each, so we're gonna take each item, we'll start with the first item

69
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:59,444
and we're gonna go to the nth item in our population, we're talking about population here

70
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:04,712
and we're gonna take, we're not gonna just take the item, this would just be the item, but we're gonna take

71
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:15,022
the item and from that we're gonna subtract the population mean, we're gonna square it, so

72
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:20,773
the way I've written it right now, this would just be the numerator, I've just taken the sum of each of these things

73
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,590
the sum, the difference between each data point and the population mean and squared it

74
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,185
If I really wanna get the way I figured out this variance right over here, I have to divide the whole

75
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:35,211
thing by the number of data points we have, So this might seen very daunting and

76
00:07:35,227 --> 00:07:44,998
very intimidating, but all it says is: Take each of your data points, well one it says figure out your population mean

77
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:53,582
figure that out first, and then from each data point in your population, subtract out that population mean

78
00:07:53,582 --> 00:07:59,935
square it, take the sum of all of those things, and then just divide by the number of data points you have

79
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:03,935
And you will get your population variance.
