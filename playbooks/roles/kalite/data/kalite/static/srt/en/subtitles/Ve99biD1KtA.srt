1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,970
Now that we have hopefully a
decent understanding of the

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:09,280
squeeze theorem, we'll use that
to prove that the limit-- I'll

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,190
do it in yellow-- the limit as
x approaches 0 of sine of

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,280
x over x is equal to 1.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,090
And you must be bubbling over
with anticipation now, because

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,535
I've said this so many times.

7
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:29,410
So let's do it, and actually,
we have to go with-- obviously,

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,220
they got our trigonometry-- and
it's actually a visual proof.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,640
So let me draw at least the
first and fourth quadrants

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
of the unit circle.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,870
I'll do that in magenta.

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,420
Let's see, let me see
if I can-- I should

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,220
draw it pretty big.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,840
Let me see.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,795
I should draw it
like quite big.

16
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,240
So I'll draw it like that.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,570
   

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,780
That's close enough.

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,030
And then let me draw the axes.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,920
So this is the x-axis, would
look something like that.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,660
Sorry, that's the y-axis.

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,180
   

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,100
There you go.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,790
And then the x-axis,
something like that.

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,030
That's our unit circle.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,810
   

27
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,220
There you go.

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,690
Now let me draw a couple
of other things.

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,170
Let me draw a-- well, it is
a radius, but I'm going to

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,580
go beyond the unit circle.

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,850
   

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,970
So let's go like right there.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,690
Draw a couple of more things,
just to set up this problem.

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,650
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

35
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,180
I wanted to do it right
from this point.

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,340
Right like that.

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
And then right from this
point, I want to do this.

38
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,720
   

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,560
And then I want to draw another
right from that point.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm going to do that.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,250
And now we are ready to go.

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,640
So what did I say?

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,860
This is the unit circle, right?

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,570
So if that's the unit
circle, what does it mean?

45
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,780
It's a circle with
a radius of 1.

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,540
So the distance from
here to here is 1.

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,040
And now if this is an angle x
in radians, what's the length

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,260
of this line right here?

49
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,310
What's the length of that line?

50
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,430
Well, by definition, sine
of x is defined to be the

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,830
y-coordinate of any point
on the unit circle.

52
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,070
So this is sine of x.

53
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,270
   

54
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,300
I'm going to run out of space,
so let me draw an arrow.

55
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,320
So this is-- that right
there is sine of x.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,300
   

57
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,270
Now let me ask you a
slightly harder one.

58
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,870
What's this length right here?

59
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,370
   

60
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,970
Well, let's think about it.

61
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,880
What is tangent?

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,370
Let's go back to our SOHCAHTOA
definition of tangent.

63
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,720
TOA.

64
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:07,380
Tangent is equal to TOA:
opposite over adjacent.

65
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,910
So what is a tangent of x?

66
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,460
   

67
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,630
Well, it would be equal to-- we
could take this-- if we say

68
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,450
that this is the right
triangle, it would be this

69
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,110
length-- the opposite--
over the adjacent, right?

70
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,440
So let's call this length
over here, let's call

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,380
this o for opposite.

72
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,620
But what's the adjacent length?

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,600
What's this base of
this larger triangle?

74
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,050
Well, it's the unit
circle, right?

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,660
So the distance from here
to here-- that distance is

76
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,830
also going to be 1, right?

77
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,070
Because it's just
a radius again.

78
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,400
That's 1.

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,980
So opposite over adjacent is
equal to the tangent of x.

80
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,350
But opposite over adjacent--
adjacent is just 1, right?

81
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,280
So the opposite side, this side
right here, it's going to be

82
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,655
equal to the tangent of x.

83
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,312
Or another way of saying it,
tangent of x is equal to this

84
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,930
side over 1, or tangent of
x is equal to this side.

85
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,700
So let me write that down.

86
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,080
That side is equal to
the tangent of x.

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,840
   

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,770
Now, let's think about the area
of a couple of parts of this

89
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,730
figure that I've drawn here.

90
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,580
Maybe I should have drawn it
a little bigger, but I think

91
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,560
we'll be able to do it.

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,210
So first let me pick a
relatively small triangle.

93
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,580
So let's do this
triangle right here.

94
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,870
I'll trace it in green.

95
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,250
So this triangle that I'm
tracing in green-- what is

96
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,730
the area of that triangle?

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,910
Well, that's going to be 1/2
times base times height.

98
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:49,850
So it's 1/2 times the
base, which is 1.

99
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,110
Right?

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,600
It's this whole triangle.

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,240
And then what's
the height of it?

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,740
Well, we just figured out that
this height right here, that

103
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,690
this height is sine of x.

104
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,780
Times sine of x.

105
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,880
   

106
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,650
So that's this green
triangle here, right?

107
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,040
Now, what is the area of--
not that green triangle.

108
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,180
Let me do it in another color.

109
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,480
Let me do it in-- oh,
I'll do it in red.

110
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,540
What is the area of this pi?

111
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,470
This pi right here.

112
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,270
That pi.

113
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,620
Hope you see-- well, that's
not a different enough color.

114
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,440
So, this pi right here.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,330
Or I'm going there.

116
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,050
And then I'm going on the arc.

117
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,630
So it's a little bit bigger
than the triangle we

118
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,640
just figured out, right?

119
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,130
It's always going to be a
little bit bigger, because it

120
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:41,220
includes this area between that
triangle and the arc, right?

121
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,890
What is the area of that arc?

122
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,600
   

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,500
Well, if this angle is x-- it's
x radiance-- what fraction

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,660
of that is out of the
entire unit circle?

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,920
Well, there are 2 pi radians in
a total unit circle, right?

126
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,220
So this area right here is
going to be equal to what?

127
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,690
It's going to be equal to the
fraction x is of the total

128
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,270
radians in the unit
circle, right?

129
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,060
So it's x radians over
2 pi radians in the

130
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,450
entire unit circle.

131
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,135
So that's kind of the fraction
that this is of-- you know, if

132
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:23,770
you did it in degrees-- the
fraction that this is over 360

133
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,350
degrees, times the area of
the whole circle, right?

134
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,490
This tells us what fraction we
are of the circle, and we're

135
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,280
going to want to multiply that
times the area of

136
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,350
the whole circle.

137
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,450
Well, what's the area
of the whole circle?

138
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,660
Well, area is pi r squared,
the radius is 1, right?

139
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,100
So the area of the entire
circle is just pi.

140
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,250
   

141
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,700
Pi r squared, r is 1, so the
area of the circle-- so the

142
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,960
area of this wedge right here,
is just going to be equal to--

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,210
these pi's cancel out--
it's equal to x over 2.

144
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,860
So that first small triangle,
that green triangle

145
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,050
we did, is sine of x.

146
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,630
1/2 sine of x, that's the
area of that green triangle.

147
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,390
Then the slightly larger area
of this wedge is-- we figured

148
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,640
out just now-- is x over 2.

149
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,630
And now let's take the area
of that larger triangle,

150
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,020
of this big triangle here.

151
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,860
And that may be
the most obvious.

152
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,130
So 1/2 base times height.

153
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,950
So that's 1/2-- the base
is 1 again-- 1 times the

154
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,720
height, is tangent of x.

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,900
Equal to 1/2 tangent of x.

156
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,640
Now, it should be clear just
looking at this diagram, no

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,350
matter where I drew this top
line, that this green triangle

158
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,690
has a smaller area than this
wedge, which has a smaller area

159
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,330
than this large triangle.

160
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:45,960
Right?

161
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,510
So let's write an
inequality that says that.

162
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,830
The green triangle-- the area
of the green triangle-- so 1/2

163
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,900
the sine of x, that's the area
of the green triangle-- it's

164
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,030
less than the area
of this wedge.

165
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,360
So that's x over 2.

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,540
And they're both less than
the area of this large

167
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,200
triangle, right?

168
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,860
Which is 1/2 tangent of x.

169
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,920
   

170
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,010
Now when is this true?

171
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,160
This is true as long as we're
in the first quadrant, right?

172
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,400
As long as we're in
the first quadrant.

173
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,960
It's also almost true if we go
into the fourth quadrant,

174
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,310
except then the sine of x
becomes negative, the tangent

175
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,130
of x becomes negative,
and x becomes negative.

176
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,300
But if we take the absolute
value of everything, it still

177
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,900
holds in the fourth quadrant.

178
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,450
Because if you go negative, as
long as we take the absolute

179
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,900
value, then the distance will
still hold and we still have

180
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,120
positive areas and all
that kind of thing.

181
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,060
So since my goal is to take the
limit as x approaches 0, and I

182
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,540
want to take the limit-- in
order for this limit to be

183
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,260
defined in general, it has to
be true from both the positive

184
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,320
and the negative side.

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,170
Let's take the absolute value
of both sides of this.

186
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,750
And hopefully this
makes sense to you.

187
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,950
If I were to draw the line down
here-- and this would be the

188
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,720
sine of x, and that would be
the tangent of x-- as long as

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,350
you took the absolute value of
everything, you're essentially

190
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,370
just doing the same thing
as in the first quadrant.

191
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,150
So let's take the absolute
value of everything.

192
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,020
And that shouldn't change
anything, especially if you're

193
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,750
in the first quadrant.

194
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,190
And you might want to think
about it a little bit, why

195
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,290
it doesn't change anything
in the second quadrant.

196
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,510
So we have this inequality.

197
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,270
Let's see if we can
play around with this.

198
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,940
So first of all, let's just
multiply everything by 2

199
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,180
and get rid of the 1/2's.

200
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,110
So we get absolute value of
sine of x is less than absolute

201
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,770
value of x, which is less than
the absolute value of

202
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,500
the tangent of x.

203
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,420
I hope I didn't confuse you by
taking the absolute value.

204
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,940
That original inequality I
wrote was completely valid in

205
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,310
the first quadrant, but since I
want this inequality to be true

206
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,510
in the first and fourth
quadrants, because I'm taking

207
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,260
the limit as x approaches 0
from both sides, I put that

208
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,120
absolute value there.

209
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,540
So you could draw the line down
there and do everything we did

210
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,470
up there in the fourth
quadrant, but just take

211
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,170
the absolute value and it
should work out the same.

212
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,390
Anyway, back to the problem.

213
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,730
So we have this inequality.

214
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,630
And I'm running out of
space, so let me erase some

215
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,710
of this stuff up here.

216
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,280
   

217
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,570
Erase.

218
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:12,760
Erase.

219
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,420
   

220
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,940
Nope, that doesn't erase.

221
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,960
OK.

222
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,400
That should erase.

223
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,230
OK.

224
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,980
So we could erase everything
that took us so far.

225
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,122
We can't forget this though.

226
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,310
This gives a lot of space.

227
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,430
OK.

228
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,700
So let's take this, and let's
take that expression, and

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,460
divide all of the sides.

230
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,190
You know, and it has
three sides, a left,

231
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,100
middle, and right.

232
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,730
Let's divide them all by the
absolute value of sine of x.

233
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,960
And since we know that the
absolute value of sine of x is

234
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,640
a positive number, we know that
these less than signs

235
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,155
don't change, right?

236
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:52,260
So let's do that.

237
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,210
So the absolute value of the
sine of x divided by the

238
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,585
absolute value of the sine
of x, well, that equals 1.

239
00:10:57,585 --> 00:11:00,440
   

240
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,230
Which is less than the absolute
value of x divided by the

241
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,870
absolute value of sine of x.

242
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,650
   

243
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,420
Which is less than-- what's the
absolute value of tan-- so, all

244
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,850
I'm doing is I'm taking the
absolute value of sine of x,

245
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,910
absolute value of sine of x,
absolute value of sine of x.

246
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,350
So what's the absolute value of
the tangent of x divided by the

247
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,580
absolute value of
the sine of x?

248
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,930
Well, tangent is just
sine over cosine.

249
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,580
So that's equal to-- so, just
do this part right here.

250
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,430
That's equal to sine over
cosine divided by sine.

251
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,895
And you know, you could say
that that's the same thing

252
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:42,680
as the absolute value.

253
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,360
And the absolute value divided
by the absolute value.

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,900
So what are you left with?

255
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,620
Well, you're just left with 1
over-- this cancels out with

256
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,550
this, that becomes a 1-- 1
over the absolute value

257
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,720
of the cosine of x.

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,630
So you might feel
we're getting close.

259
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,700
Because this looks a lot like
this, it's just inverted.

260
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,050
So to get to this,
let's invert it.

261
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,750
And to invert it, what happens?

262
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,090
Well, first of all, what
happens when you invert 1?

263
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,880
Well, 1/1 is just 1.

264
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,760
But when you invert both sides
of an inequality, you switch

265
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,960
the inequality, right?

266
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,480
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, think about this.

267
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,870
You know, if I say 1/2 is less
than 2, and I invert both sides

268
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:32,020
of that, I get 2 is
greater than 1/2.

269
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,830
So that hopefully gives
you a little intuition.

270
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,380
So if I'm inverting all of the
sides of this inequality, I

271
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,210
have to switch the
inequality signs.

272
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:48,130
So 1 is greater than absolute
value of sine of x, over the

273
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,415
absolute value of x, which is
greater than absolute

274
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,400
value of cosine of x.

275
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,430
Now let me ask you a question.

276
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,330
The absolute value of sine
of x over-- well, first

277
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,030
of all, sine of x over x.

278
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:10,140
Will there ever be a time when
sine of x over x is-- in the

279
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,730
first or the fourth quadrant--
is there ever a time that

280
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,110
sine of x over x is a
negative expression?

281
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,680
Well, in the first quadrant,
sine of x is positive,

282
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,910
and x is positive.

283
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,960
So a positive divided
by a positive is

284
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,090
going to be positive.

285
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,610
And in the fourth quadrant,
sine of x is negative, y is

286
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,390
negative, and the angle is
negative, so x is

287
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,400
also negative.

288
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,240
So in the fourth quadrant, sine
of x over x is going to be a

289
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,010
negative divided by a negative.

290
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,850
So it's going to be
a positive again.

291
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,070
So sine of x over x is always
going to be a positive.

292
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,120
So the absolute value signs
are kind of redundant.

293
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,990
So we could write 1 is greater
than sine of x over x.

294
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,250
And the same logic, in the
first and fourth quadrants--

295
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,540
and that's where
we're dealing with.

296
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,860
We're dealing with minus pi
over 2 is less than x, which

297
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,000
is less than pi over 2.

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,960
So we're going from
minus pi over 2 all

299
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,310
the way to pi over 2.

300
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,510
So we're in the fourth
and first quadrant.

301
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,050
Is cosine of x ever negative?

302
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,830
Well, cosine is the x value,
and the x-- by definition, in

303
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,653
the first and fourth
quadrants-- the x value

304
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:20,880
is always positive.

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,480
So if this is always positive,
we can get rid of the

306
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,940
absolute value signs there,
and just write that.

307
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,430
And now, we are ready to
use the squeeze theorem.

308
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,060
Let me erase all of
this down here now.

309
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,580
   

310
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,500
So let me ask you a question.

311
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:50,170
What is the limit, as
x approaches 0, of

312
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,750
the function 1?

313
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,510
Well, the function 1
is always equal to 1.

314
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,460
So I can set the limit as x
approaches infinity, the limit

315
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,310
as x approaches pi, anything.

316
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,750
This is always going
to be equal to 1.

317
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,620
So as x approaches 0,
this is equal to 1.

318
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:14,570
And then what is the limit, as
x approaches 0, of cosine of x?

319
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,620
Well, that's easy, too.

320
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,170
As x approaches 0, cosine of 0
is just 1-- and as you get,

321
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,620
you know, it's a continuous
function-- so the limit is 1.

322
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,630
So we are ready to use
the squeeze theorem.

323
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,990
As we approach 0, as
x approaches 0, this

324
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,770
function approaches 1.

325
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,650
This function approaches 1.

326
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,350
And this function, this
expression, is in

327
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,870
between the two.

328
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,300
And if it's in between the two,
as we approach-- this is

329
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,290
approaching 1 as we approach 0,
this is approaching 1 as we

330
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,470
approach 0, and this is in
between them, so it also has to

331
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,790
approach 1 as we approach 0.

332
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,340
And so we are using the squeeze
theorem based on this and this.

333
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,090
And you could say, you know,
therefore by the squeeze

334
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,740
theorem, because this is true,
this is true, and this is true,

335
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,010
sine of x over x, the limit as
x approaches 0, is equal to 1.

336
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,310
So hopefully that gave
you the intuition.

337
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,910
That another way to view it, as
this line gets smaller and

338
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,410
smaller as it approaches 0, as
x approaches zero, that this

339
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,300
area and this area converge, so
the area in between kind of has

340
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,660
to converge to the
both of them.

341
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,700
And if you want to see
it graphically, I've

342
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,490
graphed it here.

343
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,285
Let me see if I can
graph this thing.

344
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:40,610
I'll show you the graph.

345
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,850
Just so you believe me.

346
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,270
So we said that 1 is always
greater than sine of x, which

347
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:52,630
is always greater than cosine
of x, between negative pi

348
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,440
over 2 and pi over 2.

349
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,740
And of course, this isn't
defined at x is equal to 0.

350
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,350
But we can figure
out the limit.

351
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,530
So there we have it.

352
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,130
This blue line right here,
that's the function 1.

353
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,650
That's y is equal to 1.

354
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,440
This light blue line right
here is cosine of x.

355
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,430
And this is the graph
of sine of x over x.

356
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,480
And you can see that I
actually typed it in.

357
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,060
So sine of x over x, between
negative pi over 2 and pi over

358
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,170
2, or the fourth and the first
quadrants, the red line

359
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,100
is always in between.

360
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,750
It's always in between the dark
blue and the light blue line.

361
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,970
And so this is just an
intuition of what happens

362
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,180
with the squeeze theorem.

363
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,390
We know that the limit,
as this light blue line

364
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,860
approaches 0, is 1.

365
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,300
And we know the limit as
this top dark blue line

366
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
approaches 0 is 1.

367
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,780
And this red line is always
in between it, so it

368
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,240
also approaches 1.

369
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,600
So there you have it.

370
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,370
The proof, using the squeeze
theorem, and a little bit of

371
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,960
visual trigonometry, of why the
limit, as x approaches 0, of

372
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,970
sine of x over x is equal to 1.

373
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,900
I hope I haven't confused you.
