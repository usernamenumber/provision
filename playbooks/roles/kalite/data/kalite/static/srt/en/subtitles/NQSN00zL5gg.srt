1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's have some practice adding and subtracting negative numbers. So the first example

2
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:07,586
that I want to look at is 2-3.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,586
So right now I am just subtracting a positive number from another positive

4
00:00:11,616 --> 00:00:15,616
number but you might already see that I am subtracting a larger number from a smaller

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,630
number so I probably or definitely will end up with a negative number.

6
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:23,659
Let's just think about this a little bit and I am going to do it with the number line.

7
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:27,685
So there's my number line right over there. Now this is 0

8
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:34,030
This is 1. This is 2 This is negative 1 this is Negative 2. We could view this as starting

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,900
at 2 so this is 2 right over here and were going to subtract

10
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:43,911
3 from that 2 so we are going to move 3 to the left on the number line. so were going to move 3 to the left.

11
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:50,734
1, 2, 3, and that gets us to negative 1.

12
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:54,734
so it's equal to negative 1. Now let's mix it up a little bit more.

13
00:00:54,748 --> 00:01:01,848
Let's imagine what would happen if we had negative 2 minus 3

14
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:05,855
So this was positive 2 minus 3. Now let's think about negative 2 minus 3.

15
00:01:05,884 --> 00:01:12,224
So once again lets draw our number line and I will put 0 over here.

16
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:23,714
So this is 0, this is 1, this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6 and I could keep going

17
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:32,046
but were starting at negative 2, starting at negative 2 and then were subtracting 3 again so once again we are going to move 3 to the left.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
