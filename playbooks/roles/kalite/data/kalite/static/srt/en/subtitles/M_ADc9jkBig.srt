Part C.

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find all values of "x" on the interval negative 4 is less than "x" is less than 3 for which the graph

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of "g" has a point of inflection.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
give a reason for your answer.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, an inflection point is a point where the sign

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the 2nd derivative changes.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, take the second derivative at that point or as we

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
go close to that point, or as we cross that point it goes

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from positive to negative or negative to positive.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to think about that visually, you can think of some

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
examples, so if you have a curve that

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
looks something like this, you'll notice that over here

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the slope is negative, but it's increasing.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's getting less negative, less negative, then it goes to zero,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then it keeps increasing.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Slope is increasing all the way to there, then it starts

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
getting less positive.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it starts decreasing.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's increasing, the slope is increasing over this point

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here, so even though the slope is negative,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's getting less negative over here. So it's increasing,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then the slope keeps increasing because it's getting more

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and more positive up to about this point, but then the slope

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is positive, but then it becomes less positive, so the slope

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
begins decreasing after that.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So then the slope begins decreasing after that.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this right over here is a point of inflection.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The slope has gone from increasing to decreasing, and the

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
other thing happened- if the slope went from decreasing

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to increasing, that would also be a point of inflection.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if this was maybe some time of a trigometric curve, then

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you might see something like this.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so this also would be a point of inflection.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But for this, g of x is kind of hard to visualize the way

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they have defined it right over here.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the best way to think about it is just figure out where

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's second derivative has a sign change.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to think about that, we have to find it's second derivative.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's write g of x over here. We know g of x is equal to
