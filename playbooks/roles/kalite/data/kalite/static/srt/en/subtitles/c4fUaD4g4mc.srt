1
00:00:01,204 --> 00:00:08,606
on Saturday william's parents gave birth to twins and names them nadia and vanessa

2
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:10,103
when they were first born.

3
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:17,271
Nadia weighed 7.27 pounds and was 21.5 inches tall.

4
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:21,937
And Vanessa weighed 8.34 pounds.

5
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:25,273
how much did the babies weigh in total

6
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,431
so they tell us Nadia weighed 7.27

7
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,873
and Vanessa weighed 8.34 we have to add these up

8
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:35,356
and really they just gave us this length of Nadia at birth is really a distraction

9
00:00:35,356 --> 00:00:37,936
so see that we don't mindlessly add any numbers we see

10
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:41,538
so this is really unnecessary information just to distract us

11
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:45,205
so then we need to add Nadia's birth weight plus Vanessa's

12
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,602
so it is 7.27

13
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:56,131
plus 8.34 and it is always important that we line up the decimal

14
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:01,435
i like to do the decimal. so it is 8.34 and well'l just add these

15
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,273
these two up.

16
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:07,807
so 7 plus 4. and this is really 7 hundredths.

17
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:08,938
plus 4 hundredths

18
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,733
is 11 hundredths

19
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:13,804
witch is the name thing as 1 hundredths and 1 tenth.

20
00:01:13,804 --> 00:01:18,807
1 tenth plus 2 tentsh plus 3 tenths is 6 tenths.

21
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:22,144
we got our decimal sign right over there.

22
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,271
and then 7 plus eight is fifteen.

23
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:24,930
or you could even say it is 5 ones and one ten.

24
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:30,405
and we're done they weighed 15.61 pounds in total
