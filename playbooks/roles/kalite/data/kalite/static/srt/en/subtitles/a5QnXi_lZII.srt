1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,410
Let's do a slightly more complicated 2D projectile motion problem now

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:15,000
So in this situation I am going to launch the projectile off of a platform

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,370
And then it is going to land on another platform

4
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:50,880
It's coming out of the cannon. Let me do it this way just to make it 100% clear

5
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,840
So this angle right over here is 53 degrees

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:10,360
And we are going to come out the muzzle of the cannon with a velocity of 90 m/s

7
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,630
Just to give ourselves a sense of how high it's being launched from

8
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:25,850
From the muzzle of the cannon down to here, so this height right over here is 25 meters

9
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,620
and let's say that this height right over here is 9 m

10
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,960
And so we are essentially launching this from a height of 25 meters

11
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,090
I know in the last video even though I drew the cannon like this

12
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,180
we assumed that it was being launched it from a altitude of 0

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,860
and then landing back at an altitude of 0

14
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,870
Here we are assuming we're launching it from an altitude of 25 meters

15
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,280
That's when it's leaving the muzzle

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,060
and it's gonna start decelerating at least in the vertical direction

17
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,660
as soon as it leaves the muzzle

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
and then we're assuming it's not gonna land back at the same altitude

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,440
It's gonna land at a different altitude

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,790
So how do we think about this problem?

21
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,010
So the first thing you always wanna do

22
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,420
is divide your velocity vector into its horizontal and vertical components

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,390
You use the vertical component to figure out how long it will stay in the air

24
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,700
And then you use the horizontal component to figure out

25
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,430
given how long it's in the air, how far does it travel?

26
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,290
And once again, we're gonna assume the air resistance is negligible

27
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,790
So just based on what we did in the last video

28
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,480
I'll go through all of these steps in this one as well

29
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,880
If we draw our vector

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,030
the length here is going to be 90

31
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,060
The angle over here--this is our velocity vector--the angle over here between

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,060
And let me draw the horizontal component. It would look like this

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:05,720
And the vertical component would look like this

34
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,030
And so the vertical component of the vector, what would be the side right over here?

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,480
Well, this is the opposite side

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,340
We know from basic trigonometry sine of an angle is opposite over the hypotenuse

37
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:44,560
is equal to the magnitude of the vertical velocity--

38
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,780
I write that subscript Y, for the Y direction. That's the vertical direction

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,450
Over the length of the hypotenuse, over the magnitude of our original vector

40
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,790
Or if we multiply both sides by 90

41
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,630
we get that the magnitude of that side

42
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,110
Now if we want to do the horizontal component

43
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,630
the horizontal side is adjacent to this

44
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:27,210
Soh-cah-toa, cos is adjacent over hypotenuse

45
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:34,480
So the horizontal component of our velocity, I'll say x direction

46
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,500
over the hypotenuse, over 90

47
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,040
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent that's this length over 90

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,560
Multiply both sides by 90, you get that the horizontal component

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,860
Now how do we figure out how long the thing takes in the air?

50
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,340
We'll use the vertical component for that

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,180
Especially since we're dealing with different levels, we can't use that

52
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,970
more basic reasoning that, "Hey, whatever velocity we start off at

53
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,530
it's gonna be the same magnitude of velocity but the opposite direction

54
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,870
because we're not going to the same elevation

55
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,670
What we could do is we can use the formula that we derived in the previous video

56
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,100
that the displacement--let me just copy and paste this a little bit lower

57
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,980
Copy it and paste it. I'll get it right over here

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,190
So we can use this

59
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,690
We know that the displacement is equal to the initial velocity

60
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,430
and we're dealing with the vertical direction right here, times the change in time

61
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,140
plus the acceleration times the change in time squared divided by two

62
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,220
So how do we use this to figure out how long we're in the air?

63
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,200
So what is the displacement if we're starting at 25 m high and we're going to 9 m high?

64
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:21,100
So over the course, while this thing is traveling it will be displaced downwards 16 m

65
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,260
Or another way to think about it is

66
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:34,210
our displacement in the vertical direction is going to be equal to -16 m

67
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,550
Right? Because 25-9 is 16

68
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:44,540
And so we can put that into the formula we derive in the previous video. We get

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:53,900
-16 -- I won't write the units here for the sake of space and simplicity--

70
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:02,040
is equal to the initial velocity--we're dealing with just the vertical dimension here

71
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,130
Remember, it's negative because our displacement is going to be downwards

72
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,000
We're losing altitude

73
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,310
Times our change in time

74
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,070
[plus] the acceleration due to the force of gravity for objects in free fall

75
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,900
It's -9.8 m/s squared

76
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:49,760
but we're dividing that by two. So we have -4.9 m/s^2

77
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,330
times delta t squared, times our change in time squared

78
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,410
So how do we solve something like this? You can't just factor out a t and solve it

79
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,740
You might recognize that this is a quadratic equation right over here

80
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,900
The way you solve quadratic equations is

81
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,800
you get everything on one side of this equation and then

82
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,710
you either factor it out, or more likely in the situation, you will use the quadratic formula

83
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,050
which we proved in other videos, hopefully, giving you the intuition for it

84
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,170
to actually solve for the times where your displacement in the vertical direction is -16 m

85
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,650
I will get 2 solutions here, and one solution will be a negative change in time

86
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,250
There some time in the past, you're also at -16 m

87
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,320
That's nonsensical for this problem

88
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,270
So we want to take the positive value here

89
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,090
So let's put all of this on one side of the equation

90
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,550
Let's add 16 to both sides

91
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,970
On the left-hand side you get a zero

92
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,240
Zero is equal to--I'll write it in the traditional way that we're used to seeing

93
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,270
I'll write the highest degree term first. So -4.9 times delta t squared

94
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:32,100
and then +16

95
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,160
All of this is equal to zero

96
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,150
And this once against is just the quadratic equation. We can find its roots

97
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,490
and the roots will be in terms of delta t. We can solve for delta t using the quadratic formula

98
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,760
So we get delta t--

99
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,460
if this is very unfamiliar to you, review the videos on Khan Academy algebra playlist

100
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,040
on the quadratic formula. If you don't know where it came from, it also proved it for you

101
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,630
So it's equal to negative b--b is this right here, the coefficient on the delta t

102
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll write the quadratic formula for those of you who can't remember it

103
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,740
So I'm going to solve Ax^2+Bx+C=0

104
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,680
The roots over here is going to be -B

105
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,830
These are going to be the X values that satisfy this equation up here

106
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,440
So that's what I'm doing over here. This is the B value, negative B plus or minus--

107
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,330
It turns out we only care about the plus one, because that's gonna give us the positive value

108
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,930
B squared, so it's this quantity squared

109
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:23,300
-4 times A which is -4.9, times C which is 16

110
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:30,300
This radical all the way over here. All that over 2A

111
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,480
A is -4.9, so 2A is -9.8

112
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,820
So now we can get the calculator out to figure out our change in time

113
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,920
I'm just gonna focus on the positive version of it

114
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,140
I'll leave it up to you to find the negative version and see if

115
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,280
that'll give you a negative value for change in time

116
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,190
And that's nonsensical. So we only care about the positive change in time where we get to

117
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,610
a placement of -16 meters

118
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,470
Let's get the calculator out

119
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,360
So we get--let me do this carefully. We have

120
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:37,390
these two negatives cancel out. So it's plus 4 times positive 4.9 times 16

121
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,590
and that closes off our entire radical

122
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,970
And so this will give me the numerator up here

123
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:52,320
And I want to divide that by -9.8

124
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,620
Oh, I just realized that I made a mistake

125
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,000
I said that the positive version would give you the positive time

126
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,350
but now we realize that is wrong because when I took the positive version up here

127
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:10,780
I get a positive 2.14 for the numerator, but then we divide it by -9.8

128
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,030
we'll get a negative value. So that's not gonna be the time we care about

129
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,960
So we care about the time where this is a negative value

130
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,180
So let me reenter that. Let me do the negative value

131
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,910
Let me go back a little bit

132
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:32,740
And then let me replace this with a -

133
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,230
So we look at the negative value, because I want the positive time

134
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,870
And so now my numerator here is a negative value. So this is actual what we care about

135
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:49,000
The numerator is a negative value, you divide it by -9.8

136
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,830
and you get--I'll just round--14.89 seconds

137
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,420
So delta t the positive version is equal to 14.89 second

138
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,570
So my initial comment about wanting to using the positive version was wrong

139
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,500
because we have a negative denominator, so you want the numerator to be

140
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,060
negative, and only the numerator is negative, will the whole expression be positive

141
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,950
So we've got this positive time of 14.89 second

142
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:24,480
Let me solve for the horizontal displacement, although this is running long

143
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:31,330
So the amount of time that we're in the air is 14.89 seconds

144
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,110
So if I were to ask you the horizontal displacement

145
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,750
it's going to be the amount of time we're in the air

146
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,760
times your constant horizontal velocity

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,990
We already figured it out, our constant horizontal velocity

148
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,430
So if you want to figure out how far along the x-axis we get displaced

149
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:57,800
we just take this time times--that just means our previous answer--

150
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,920
and that gives us 806 m. So this displacement right over here is 806 m
