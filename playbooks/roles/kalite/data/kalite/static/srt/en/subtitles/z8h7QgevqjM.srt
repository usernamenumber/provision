1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's systematically name some
carboxylic acids, so let's add

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:10,170
a molecule that looked
like this.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,070
Clearly a carboxylic acid,
we have a carboxyl

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,100
group right over here.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,590
Now to name it systematically,
we do it just the way we've

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,030
named our simple alkenes.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,330
When we first learned how to
name any organic molecule, you

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,890
look for the longest
carbon chain.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,430
And the longest carbon chain
is one, two, three, four

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,960
carbons, so our prefix will
be but-, so it's butan.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,350
Instead of calling it butane,
instead of writing this e

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,480
here, we know this is a
carboxylic acid, it has this

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,760
carboxyl group, so
we butanoic acid.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,260
And you might wonder, don't we
have to specify where the

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,220
carboxyl group is?

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,710
And if you look at how
carboxylic acids are arranged,

18
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,870
you can tell that the carboxyl
group is always going to be at

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,080
one end of a carbon chain, so
you don't have to specify.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,110
In fact, you always want to
start numbering at wherever

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,570
the carboxyl carbon is.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,200
So if you have to number these,
this would be the one

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,050
carbon, the two, the three,
and the four.

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,770
So you don't have to specify a
number for the carboxyl group.

25
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,170
Let's do another one.

26
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,830
Let's say we had something
that looked like this.

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,290
   

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,190
Let me put another carbon on
there, just like that, and

29
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,840
let's say that there's
a methyl group.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,150
   

31
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,010
Now clearly, a carboxylic
acid, but to name it

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,100
systematically we just want to
find the longest carbon chain.

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,560
So we have one, two, three,
four, five, six carbons, so

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,250
our prefix will be hex-,
so it's hexan.

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,980
   

36
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,660
It's clearly not just a hexane,
it's a hexanoic acid,

37
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,020
it has this carboxyl
group right here.

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,560
This is hexanoic acid.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,490
And we're not done, because we
still have this methyl carbon

40
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,440
right over here, and it is on
the-- we always want to start

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,340
numbering at this
carbonyl carbon.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,750
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

43
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,930
It is at the number three
carbon, so this is 3 methyl

44
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,670
hexanoic acid.

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,900
Let's do one more.

46
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,540
Let's say we had a molecule
that looked like this.

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,650
That's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

48
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,270
Then we have our carboxyl group
just like that, and

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,870
let's say that we had a double
bond right over there.

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,170
What would we call this?

51
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,780
Well, once again, look for
the longest carbon chain.

52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,290
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons, so

53
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,060
the prefix is hept-,
so it's heptan.

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,610
And actually let me be careful,
this isn't an alcane.

55
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,440
This has a double
bond right here.

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,050
So it's hepten.

57
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,140
If this was just an alkene, we
would just called heptene, but

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,660
we're not going to put this last
e here, because this is

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,660
the carboxylic acid.

60
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,290
And to specify where that double
bond is, we need to

61
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,200
start numbering, and we
start numbering at

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,210
the carbonyl carbon.

63
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,000
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,070
So you could either name this
3 hepten, and I haven't

65
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,550
finished it yet, I haven't put
this final e over here.

66
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:43,150
Or you could name it hept
3 ene, just like that.

67
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,480
This is the more typical one
that you would see, because it

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,920
tells you we have a double bond,
and it starts at the

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,030
number three carbon, goes from
the three to the four carbon.

70
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,920
But this isn't just a regular
alkene, this is

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,180
a carboxylic acid.

72
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,540
So instead of writing that final
e, for an alkene, we

73
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,990
write it as we have a carboxyl
group right here, so this is 3

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,520
heptenoic acid.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,210
And we are done.

76
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,490
Actually if you wanted to get
really fancy on this one right

77
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,940
over here, you could see that
these two carbons that are on

78
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,850
the double bond, so this carbon
and this carbon, it's

79
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,302
kind of a range like this.

80
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:24,390
Let me draw it like this.

81
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,320
They both have other hydrogens
off there that we didn't draw,

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,450
they're implicitly there.

83
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,270
But if you wanted to rewrite or
redraw this molecule, you

84
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,220
could draw it like this.

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,080
You have two carbons,
just like this.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,670
This one has a hydrogen popping
up like that; that one

87
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,760
has a hydrogen popping
down like that.

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,370
And then this carbon over
here has this big

89
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,280
functional group over here.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,410
We'll call that R.

91
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,990
And then this one over here--
I'll do it in green-- has this

92
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,570
other functional group, has
these three carbons.

93
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,980
We can call that R prime.

94
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,530
And if you look at it this way,
the functional groups are

95
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,360
on opposite sides of
the double bond.

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
They're away from each other.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:12,500
So if you wanted to, you could
also call this trans 3

98
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,860
heptenoic acid.

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,660
And this will specify
that these guys

100
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,610
are on opposite ends.

101
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,510
But this is only if you're
assuming that I drew it in the

102
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,780
actual three dimensional
configuration in some way.

103
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,140
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
