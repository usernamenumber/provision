1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,661
...and they tell us that p is greater than 7r.

2
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:17,128
So, let's first think about the area of a rectangle

3
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:19,698
with length p and width 2r.

4
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:23,079
So, this is our rectangle right here...

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,390
it has a length of p and it has a width of 2r.

6
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,423
So, what's its area? Well it's just going to be

7
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:34,300
the length times the width. So, the area here

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,520
is going to be p... or maybe I should say 2rp.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,356
This is the length times the width, or the width times the length.

10
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:45,669
So, the area is equal to 2rp for the rectangle.

11
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:48,213
Now. We also want to find the difference between

12
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:50,433
this area and the area of a circle.

13
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:53,064
The area of a circle with diameter 4r.

14
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,372
So, what's the area of the circle going to be?

15
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,770
So, let me draw our circle over here...

16
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:04,845
So, our circle looks like that. It's diameter is 4r.

17
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:06,945
How do we figure out the area of a circle?

18
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:14,837
The area is equal to pi(r) squared for a circle, where r is the radius.

19
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,213
They gave us the diameter. The radius is half of that.

20
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:21,264
So, the radius here is going to be half this distance or 2r.

21
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:29,219
So, the area of our circle is going to be pi times 2r squared.

22
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,463
This is the radius right there, so we're squaring the entire radius.

23
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:37,144
So, this is going to be equal to pi times 4 times r2, I'm just squaring each of these terms.

24
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:47,670
Or, if we were to change the order, the area of the circle is equal to 4(pi)r2.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,631
And we want to find the difference.

26
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,630
So, to find the difference, it's helpful, just so we don't end up with a negative number...

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,813
to figure out which of these two is larger.

28
00:01:55,813 --> 00:02:01,354
So, they're telling us that p is greater than 7r.

29
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:05,679
So, let's think about this. If p is greater than 7r...

30
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,448
then 2... let me write it this way...

31
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:13,739
We know that p is greater than 7r, so if we were to multiply

32
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,282
both sides of this equation by 2r, and 2r is positive...

33
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,193
we're dealing with positive distances - positive lengths

34
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:24,784
So, if we multiply both sides of this equation by 2r, it shouldn't change the equation.

35
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:29,521
So, multiply that by 2r, and then multiply this by 2r.

36
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:41,053
Then our equation becomes 2r(p) is greater than 14 r squared.

37
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:44,402
Now why is this interesting? Actually, why did I multiply this by 2r?

38
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:47,677
Well that's so that this becomes the same as the area of the rectangle.

39
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:55,867
So, this is the area of the rectangle, and what's 14 r squared?

40
00:02:55,867 --> 00:03:02,306
Well, 4 times pi is going to get us something less than 14.

41
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:09,335
This is less than 14, so this is 4 pi is less than 14.

42
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:23,829
14 is ... let me put it this way... 4 times 3.5 is equal to 14, right?

43
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:30,140
So, 4 times pi, which is less than 3.5, is going to be less than 14.

44
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,125
So, we know that this over here is larger than this quantity over here...

45
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:39,398
it's larger than 4(pi)r squared. And so we know that

46
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:43,762
this rectangle has a larger area than the circle.

47
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:46,440
So, we can just subtract the circle's area from

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,310
the rectangle's area to find the difference.

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,898
So, the difference is going to be the area of the rectangle

50
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:55,099
which we already figured out as 2r(p)

51
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,545
...and we're going to subtract from that the area of the circle.

52
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:05,976
The area of the circle is 4(pi)r squared.

53
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:08,839
So, hopefully that made sense...

54
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,516
One point I want to clarify, I gave the equation

55
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:16,417
of a circle - the area of a circle - to be (pi)r squared.

56
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,578
And then we said that the radius is actually

57
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:22,469
2r in this case, so, I substituted 2r for r.

58
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:23,523
Hopefully, that doesn't confuse you.

59
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:26,453
This r is the general term for any radius.

60
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:30,699
They later told us that the actual radius is 2 times some letter r.

61
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,267
So, I substitute that into the formula.

62
00:04:33,267 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.
