1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,460
We're asked to solve for s.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,500
And we have s squared minus
2s minus 35 is equal to 0.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,570
Now if this is the first time
that you've seen this type of

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,140
what's essentially a quadratic
equation, you might be tempted

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,790
to try to solve for s using
traditional algebraic means,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,760
but the best way to solve this,
especially when it's

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,690
explicitly equal to 0, is to
factor the left-hand side, and

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,380
then think about the fact that
those binomials that you

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,990
factor into, that they have
to be equal to 0.

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,890
So let's just do that.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,000
So how can we factor this?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,390
We've seen it in several ways.

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,040
I'll show you the standard
we've been doing it, by

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,260
grouping, and then there's a
little bit of a shortcut when

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,670
you have a 1 as a coefficient
over here.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,580
So when you do something by
grouping, when you factor by

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,860
grouping, you think about two
numbers whose sum is going to

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,710
be equal to negative 2.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,436
So you think about two numbers
whose sum, a plus b, is equal

21
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,890
to negative 2 and whose product
is going to be equal

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,540
to negative 35.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,530
a times b is equal
to negative 35.

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,900
So if the product is a negative
number, one has to be

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,910
positive, one has
to be negative.

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,490
And so if you think about it,
ones that are about two apart,

27
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,420
you have 5 and negative 7,
I think that'll work.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,410
5 plus negative 7 is equal
to negative 2.

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,770
So to factor by grouping, you
split this middle term.

30
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,540
We can split this into a--
let me write it this way.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,450
We have s squared, and then this
middle term right here,

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,920
I'll do it in pink.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,440
This middle term right there I
can write it as plus 5s minus

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,140
7s and then we have
the minus 35.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,560
And then, of course, all
of that is equal to 0.

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,430
Now, we call it factoring by
grouping because we group it.

37
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,120
So we can group these first two
terms. And these first two

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,870
terms, they have a common
factor of s.

39
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,900
So let's factor that out.

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,090
You have s times s plus 5.

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,020
That's the same thing as
s squared plus 5s.

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,850
Now, in these second two terms
right here, you have a common

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,510
factor of negative 7, so
let's factor that out.

44
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,290
So you have negative
7 times s plus 5.

45
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,670
And, of course, all of
that is equal to 0.

46
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,580
Now, we have two terms here,
where both of them have s plus

47
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,830
5 as a factor.

48
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,590
   

49
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,240
So we can factor that out.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,320
So let's do that.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:37,930
So you have s plus 5 times
this s right here, right?

52
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,930
S plus 5 times s will
give you this term.

53
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,640
And then you have minus
that 7 right there.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,580
I undistributed the s plus 5.

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,940
And then this is going
to be equal to 0.

56
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,890
Now that we've factored it, we
just have to think a little

57
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,390
bit about what happens
when you take the

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,520
product of two numbers?

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,200
I mean, s plus 5 is a number.

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,180
s minus 7 is another number.

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,930
And we're saying that the
product of those two numbers

62
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,940
is equal to zero.

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,570
If ever told you that I had
two numbers, if I told you

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:10,110
that I had the numbers a times
b and that they equal to 0,

65
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,770
what do we know about either
a or b or both of them?

66
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,280
Well, at least one of them has
to be equal to 0, or both of

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,150
them have to be equal to 0.

68
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,090
So, the fact that this number
times that number is equal to

69
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:30,820
zero tells us that either s plus
5 is equal to 0 or-- and

70
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,120
maybe both of them-- s minus
7 is equal to 0.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,370
I'll do that in just green.

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,160
   

73
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,925
And so you have these two
equations, and actually, we

74
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,020
could say and/or.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,000
It could be or/and, either way,
and both of them could be

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,470
equal to 0.

77
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,390
So let's see how we can
solve for this.

78
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,020
Well, we can just subtract
5 from both sides of this

79
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,280
equation right there.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,150
And so you get, on the left-hand
side, you have s is

81
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,620
equal to negative 5.

82
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,840
That is one solution to the
equation, or you can add 7 to

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,630
both sides of that equation, and
you get s is equal to 7.

84
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,600
So if s is equal to negative 5,
or s is equal to 7, then we

85
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,019
have satisfied this equation.

86
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,250
We can even verify it.

87
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,890
If you make s equal to negative
5, you have positive

88
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,810
25 plus 10, which is minus 35.

89
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,410
That does equal zero.

90
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,890
If you have 7, 49 minus 14
minus 35 does equal zero.

91
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,280
So we've solved for s.

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,490
Now, I mentioned there's
an easier way to do it.

93
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,270
And when you have something like
this, where you have 1 as

94
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,980
the leading coefficient,
you don't have to do

95
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,120
this two-step factoring.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,130
Let me just show
you an example.

97
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,460
If I just have x plus a
times x plus b, what

98
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,570
is that equal to?

99
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,010
x times x is x squared,
x times b is bx.

100
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,470
a times x is plus ax.

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,590
a times b is ab.

102
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,050
So you get x squared plus--
these two can be added-- plus

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,350
a plus bx plus ab.

104
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,260
And that's the pattern that
we have right here.

105
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,300
We have 1 as a leading
coefficient here, we have 1 as

106
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,770
a leading coefficient here.

107
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,080
So once we have our two
numbers that add up to

108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,090
negative 2, that's our a plus
b, and we have our product

109
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,050
that gets to negative 35, then
we can straight just factor it

110
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,990
into the product of
those two things.

111
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,410
So it will be-- or the product
of the binomials, where those

112
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,610
will be the a's and the b's.

113
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,110
So we figured it out.

114
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,460
It's 5 and negative 7.

115
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,050
5 plus negative 7
is negative 2.

116
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,130
5 times negative 7
is negative 35.

117
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,660
So we could have just straight
factored at this point.

118
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,030
2, well, actually this
was the case of s.

119
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,920
So we could have factored it
straight to the case of s plus

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,860
5 times s minus 7.

121
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,920
We could have done that straight
away and would've

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,850
gotten to that right there.

123
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,320
And, of course, that whole
thing was equal to zero.

124
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,960
So that would've been a little
bit of a shortcut, but

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
factoring by grouping is a
completely appropriate way to

126
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,090
do it as well.

127
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,266
