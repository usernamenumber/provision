00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:05,033
Toby is a farmer. 
He plants 12 rows of carrots in a field.

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:10,265
Each row has six carrots. 
How many carrots did Toby plant?

3
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:12,262
So let's try to visualize this thing.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,767
So they tell us each row has 6 carrots.
Let's try to visualize a row.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:21,875
So that's 1 carrot, that's 2 carrots, that's 3 carrots, that's 4 carrots,

6
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,197
that's 5 carrots and that's 6 carrots.

7
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:29,677
(I can even do, just so it looks nice, a little leafy part of the carrots. 
So this we can visualize easy as carrots.)

8
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:33,346
So that's 1 row of carrots. He tells each row has 6 carrots.

9
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:39,383
Now there're twelve of these, he plants twelve rows of carrots. (Let me see if I can copy and paste this.)

10
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:46,024
(So... copy and paste.) So that's two rows... (I want to make sure I have enough space.)

11
00:00:46,024 --> 00:00:58,609
Two rows. That's three rows. That's four rows. This is five rows. This is six rows.

12
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:00,467
(And actually I can just copy and paste the whole thing.)

13
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:04,368
This is six rows, I need... just
need to double that to get twelve rows so let me do that.

14
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:07,711
(So copy and paste... There you go.)

15
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:11,055
So there's twelve rows right over here. And let's number this.

16
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:19,100
So they tell us... they tell us each row has six carrots. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

17
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:31,767
They tell us he plants a total of twelve rows. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

18
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,671
How many carrots did Toby plant?

19
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,633
Well you could do this exercise and then try to count all of these carrots but that seems a little bit crazy.

20
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:43,284
These are already a lot of carrots and especially if there were even larger numbers, it would take you forever to count it!

21
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:52,015
Luckily for us, we have multiplication as a tool that we can use.

22
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:59,631
So if you have twelve rows and each of those rows has six, this is really twelve times six.

23
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:04,275
You're going to have twelve rows, in each of those you have six carrots.

24
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:07,294
So you could say you have six carrots twelve times.

25
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:15,281
So this is going to be 12 times 6. If you remember your multiplication tables up to twelve, you'll remember that 12 times 6 is 72.

26
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:21,367
So he has 72 carrots. Even if you only remember... well I'll just leave it there.

27
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:25,367
If you remember your multiplication (and you should because that is one of the things in life that will... have long lasting benefits.) it's 72 carrots.
