1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,790
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,700
In the last video, I at the
end of the video, like I

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,700
always do in the attempt to
confuse you, I told you that

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,060
if I had two vectors-- And let
me just make up some new ones,

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,520
so I can draw them visually
in a second or two.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,920
Let's call the first vector a.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,910
Let me do a different color.

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,490
This toothpaste color is
getting monotonous.

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,880
Let me do something that
looks relaxing.

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,910
Let's call a first vector a and,
I don't know, let's make

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,500
it interesting, let me say it's
minus 3 times the unit

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,520
vector i plus 2 times
the unit vector j.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,570
And then I have vector b.

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:48,120
And that is equal to, 2i, so two
times the unit vector i.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,100
Plus, 4 times the
unit vector j.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,550
In the last video I said, well,
the whole reason why

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,680
this unit vector notation is
even -- Well, one of the

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,860
reasons, we'll see that there
many reasons why it's useful.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,390
One of the really cool things
about it is, before when we

21
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,170
added vectors, we would put them
head to tails, and then

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,960
draw it visually, and then
we had this new vector.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,980
And we really had no way
of expressing it

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,130
without drawing it.

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,850
But when we write things as
multiples of the unit vectors.

26
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,020
We don't have to draw it.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,290
And it's actually very
easy to add vectors.

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,890
And how do we do it?

29
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,050
We just add the x components,
and we add the y components.

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,100
So we said that these two
vectors, a plus b, these

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,320
little weird arrows on top,
that's just saying that those

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,790
are vectors.

33
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,040
That's equals.

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,290
   

35
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,640
So it's minus 3, plus 2i, and
I'm going to arbitrarily

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,150
switch colors, because it's
getting monotonous.

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,450
Plus 2 plus 4j.

38
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,680
We just added the x
components, or the

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,800
multiples of i.

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,440
And we added the y components,
or just the multiples of j.

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,180
Because i was the unit vector in
the x direction, and j was

42
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,050
the unit vector in
the y direction.

43
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,560
And we get, what's
minus 3 plus 2?

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,600
That's minus 1.

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,190
We get minus 1i.

46
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,510
That could just be minus i.

47
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,720
But I'll write the 1 because
we're just getting warmed up

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,419
with unit vectors.

49
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,410
So minus 1i plus 6j.

50
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,990
And when I did that, you might
say, well, Sal, I can't just

51
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,790
take your word for it.

52
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,910
Because you seem
not someone who

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,090
should be believed blindly.

54
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,200
So I think that's a valid
opinion to have. So I will

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,330
show you that this works, by
adding the vectors visually.

56
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,410
So let's draw it.

57
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,640
And I think this will give you
a little better sense of unit

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,910
vectors generally.

59
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,635
Let me draw the axes.

60
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:44,140
   

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,820
So that's my y-axis.

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,070
Let me draw my x-axis.

63
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,700
   

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,400
I have to make sure have enough
space to draw the unit

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,890
vectors that we've drawn,
or to draw the

66
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,140
vectors that we've drawn.

67
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,690
   

68
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,990
Just to show that the axes go
on forever, I have to draw

69
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,270
that arrow.

70
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:13,433
All right, so let's say
this is 1, 2, 3.

71
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:21,140
This is 1, 2, 3, 4.

72
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:30,360
And I draw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,110
I think we should be able
to now add them.

74
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,020
I didn't have to waste all
this space down here.

75
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,200
So let's just first draw the
vectors, minus 3i plus 2j.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,070
So minus 3i, just this right
here, is going to be a vector

77
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,700
that looks something
like this.

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,600
So it's just minus 3 times
the x vector, so

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
it'll go to the left.

80
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,780
Because i is 1 in the
positive direction.

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,180
If we put a negative there,
it flips it over.

82
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,690
Let me use a different color.

83
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,940
So this is minus 3i,
and then plus 2j.

84
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,560
So plus 2j looks like this.

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,590
   

86
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,300
If we were to add those two
vectors visually, we can put

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,170
them head to tails.

88
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,750
And the way we can do that, we
can either shift this vector

89
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,730
up like this, and
draw it up here.

90
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,910
Or we could shift this vector,
and put its tail

91
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,810
its vector's head.

92
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,010
But either way, let's
shift this one up.

93
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,950
So if we shifted up like that.

94
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,160
Remember, we're just doing the
head to tails, visual addition

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
method of vectors.

96
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,340
So I just put this tail
to this head.

97
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,260
And what do we get?

98
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,400
So vector a will look like this,
and I'm going to do it

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,360
in the same color as vector a
because I have a feeling that

100
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,710
this diagram might
get complicated.

101
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,900
   

102
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,150
Well, I wanted to use
the line tool.

103
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,180
   

104
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,700
OK, so this is vector a.

105
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,740
That's what vector
a looks like.

106
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,880
And so we worked backwards.

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,260
I gave you the x component
and the y component.

108
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,310
And then I added them together
by doing the head to tails

109
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,990
method, and so this is what
vector a would look like.

110
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,440
And, instead of drawing it, a
very easy representation is

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,990
exactly what we did up here,
a unit vector notation.

112
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,800
And what's vector b look like?

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,320
So it's 2i-- I'm going to do a
completely different color.

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,680
It's 2i, so it's this vector.

115
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,500
2 times unit vector i.

116
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,990
That's this.

117
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,170
Plus 4j, 1, 2, 3, 4.

118
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,870
So it looks like this.

119
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,240
And let's take this one and
shift it over to the left, so

120
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,170
we can put its tail to the
vector's head, so it would

121
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,140
look like this.

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,370
So vector b will look --
I'll do it in red.

123
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,760
And I'll use a line tool.

124
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,540
Vector b looks like this.

125
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,450
   

126
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,500
I just put its components head
to tails, and that's how

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,170
I got vector b.

128
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,480
And if I were to add
them visually.

129
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,640
I would do it the same way that
I added its components.

130
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,120
I would put the tail of one
vector to the head of the

131
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,100
other, and see if you get
the resulting vector.

132
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,930
So you could do it either way.

133
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,270
Let's shift this a vector.

134
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,760
Let's shift it in
this direction.

135
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,250
Remember, vectors, we're
just giving the

136
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,350
magnitude of direction.

137
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,880
We're not necessarily giving
a starting point.

138
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,300
So you can shift them.

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,600
You just can't change their
orientation or their

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,850
magnitudes.

141
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,930
And that's actually how you add
them, you shift them, and

142
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,970
put them head to tails.

143
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,690
That's when you add
them visually.

144
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,780
Let's put that a
vector up here.

145
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,015
So if we have the a vector, it
looks something like this.

146
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:40,270
   

147
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,700
And I want it to
work out right.

148
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,640
So the a vector looks
something like that.

149
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,280
And remember, all I did was I
took the same vector, and I

150
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,940
just shifted it.

151
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,310
So that it can start
at the head.

152
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,160
So its tail can start at the
head of the b vector.

153
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,060
I just shifted the a vector, so
this is still the a vector.

154
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,030
By moving the vector
around, you

155
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,340
haven't changed the vector.

156
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,980
I would only change the vector,
if I scaled it, if I

157
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,180
made it bigger or smaller, if
I changed its orientation.

158
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,600
And so visually, this is b, this
is a, so if I add a to b,

159
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,880
the resulting vector, going head
to tails-- i'll do it in

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,700
this green color --would
look like this.

161
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,280
   

162
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,710
It would look like that.

163
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,940
So here we took all this
trouble, and I had to draw

164
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,630
these straight lines
to visually

165
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,710
add these two vectors.

166
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,140
This green vector is a plus b.

167
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,170
Let's see if this green
vector is the same

168
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,540
thing that we got here.

169
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,070
Let's see if it's the
same thing as this.

170
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,660
So we got negative 1 times
i, so negative 1 is here.

171
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,440
And then we have 6j.

172
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,530
Let me do it in another color.

173
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,330
6j would look like this.

174
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,520
6j looks like that.

175
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,160
You put them heads to tails.

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,020
And it would be something
like this.

177
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,320
And that is the green vector.

178
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,840
And actually, just so you know,
I know it didn't line up

179
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,660
perfectly, and that's because
I'm not drawing neatly, but

180
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,420
these two points should actually
be here if I were to

181
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,980
have drawn this better.

182
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,930
But I know this is
very confusing, I

183
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,840
had all these colors.

184
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,620
But the whole point of it is,
I wanted to show that you

185
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,440
could visually draws vectors,
and then shift them around,

186
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,840
and then put them
heads to tails.

187
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,440
And then get the resulting
vector.

188
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,170
That's one way to add vectors,
there's still no way to

189
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,280
analytically represent it.

190
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,510
Or you could just write any
vector as its x and y

191
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,340
components, and then the sum of
the vectors is just going

192
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,409
to be the sum of the x's
and the sum of the y's.

193
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,049
And that's a much cleaner, and
a much easier, and much less

194
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,840
prone to error, way of adding
or subtracting two vectors.

195
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
So hopefully that
was convincing.

196
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,660
That a plus b really
is this vector.

197
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,470
If it wasn't, I'm sorry.

198
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,620
And I hope I didn't
confuse you more.

199
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,240
But now that we have this out
of the way, and hopefully

200
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,860
you're convinced that unit
vector notation is useful.

201
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,050
We can move on and maybe try
to do some of our old

202
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,370
projectile motion problems
using this notation.

203
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,140
And maybe it'll let us
to do a little bit of

204
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,590
extra stuff with it.

205
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,100
See you soon.

206
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,300
