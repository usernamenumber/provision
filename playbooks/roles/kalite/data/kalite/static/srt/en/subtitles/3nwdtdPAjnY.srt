1
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:05,000
When we left off, we were trying to figure out: what did the magnitude of our initial velocity

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,067
need to be for the ball to clear the Green Monster at Fenway park, assuming that the batter hits it at a 45 degree angle,

3
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:20,333
and he hits it one meter above home plate, and the Green Monster is 96 meters away and it's 11.3 meters high.

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:26,533
So, the x-component of the displacement when it's at 96 meters, the y-component of the displacement has

5
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,884
to be 10.3 meters. Not the 11.3. Because it's already

6
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:35,933
starting at one meter high, it just has to get 10.3 more, it just needs to be 10.3 meters higher.

7
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:40,000
And we set up the problem, we set up our formula we derived in multiple videos

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,067
on displacement as a function of time and inital velocity

9
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:48,533
and our acceleration, and now we're ready to go because we have all of the ingredients.

10
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,223
So let's apply it. And what's really neat is, we'll essentially be able to do

11
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:56,667
both the horizontal and the vertical components at the same time now that we've expressed all of

12
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:03,067
our vectors in engineering notation, as a combination of scaled multiples of i and j vectors.

13
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:08,940
So, our displacement as a function of time, our displacement as a function of time,

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,536
I'll just write it all in green, is going to be equal to v sub i times t.

15
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:18,733
Well, v sub i is all of this business right over here. v sub i is all of this business.

16
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:24,400
And if you multiply a vector times a scalar, and t is a scalar, it's just a number,

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,933
you just multiply each, you just scale each of its components by that much.

18
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:34,200
So this is going to be equal to square root of 2, lemme, lemme make it...

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,600
So, this part, maybe I should, so this part right over here, this part right over here,

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,867
is going to be square root of 2 over 2 times the magnitude of our initial velocity, times time times

21
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:57,067
i, so I'm just multiplying this times time. So both of these terms have to be multiplied times time.

22
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,133
Both of these component vectors.

23
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:05,800
Plus square root of 2 over 2, time v sub i, times time, because we're multiplying it

24
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,067
by this time right over here, times j.

25
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:16,371
So that is v sub i times t over there. Maybe I'll make the t in yellow just so you see

26
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:22,133
that this t, I've just distributed this t onto both terms on the, on our initial velocity vector.

27
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:28,067
So, this thing expands onto all of this business over here. I'll underline it in the same way.

28
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:33,368
It expands into all that stuff over there, and then over here we're scaling the acceleration

29
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:38,533
vector, we're essentially multiplying it by t squared over 2. So we multiply every term here

30
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:44,867
by t squared over 2. Well, there really isn't an i term, we can just ignore it, so all we have is this

31
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:50,200
j term. And we multiply it by t squared over 2. So all of this over here is this vector

32
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,133
times t squared over 2. So if I multiply this by t squared over 2, I get the divided by 2 part,

33
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:06,133
9.8 divided by 2 is -4.9 and then t squared j.

34
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,600
So this part right over here gives us this right here. I just multiplied

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,000
t squared over 2 times -9.8 to get the magnitude right over here, and it's going,

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,933
it's in the vertical direction, although this negative tells us that we're going down in the vertical

37
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:26,133
direction. Now remember, remember, we need to get, we need to figure out, we need to figure out what

38
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:30,200
this velocity needs to be. So we have to have some constraints here because we have

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,295
2 unknowns here. We have a t and we have a v, but luckily we can set up 2 equations.

40
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:40,613
Because we said that our necessary displacement, when we just tip the top of the wall,

41
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:45,533
has to be, so I call that the necessary displacement.

42
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:50,867
So the displacement necessary has to be 96 in the horizontal direction,

43
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:55,933
96 meters in the horizontal direction, 96 meters in the horizontal direction,

44
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:06,533
and 10.3 meters in the vertical direction. So, plus 10.3 meters in the vertical direction.

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:13,283
So how can we set up 2 equations here? So what's the, what's the horizontal component

46
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:17,625
of all of this business up here? Well, the horizontal component of all of this is

47
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,621
what's multipied by the i vector. I can even write, make it orange right over there.

48
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:25,961
So that needs to be equal to this right over here, and what's the vertical component?

49
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,867
Well, the vertical component is all the stuff that's multiplied by the j vector.

50
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:33,694
And actually, we can group them, we could factor out a j vector, I guess is one way to think about it.

51
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:39,467
And all of that needs to be equal to this! Needs to be this over here. And so that essentially gives

52
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:48,533
us 2 equations and 2 unknowns, and allows us to solve for the necessary v to clear the Green Monster.

53
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:56,533
So let's try that out. So this first equation, we get, right over here, square root of 2 over 2,

54
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:02,811
times our initial velocity times time, needs to be equal to 96, right? The magnitude

55
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:07,933
here has to be equal to the same magnitude here. And then if we talk about all of the j components,

56
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,667
we could factor out all of the j components, we could factor out a j here, so all of this stuff

57
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:17,370
is multiplied by j, all of this stuff is multiplied by j, I essentially just factored it out,

58
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,200
so this is the magnitude in the vertical direction, and that needs to be equal to 10.3.

59
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:31,117
So our second, our second equation with two unknowns is square root of 2 over 2, times the magnitude

60
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:42,133
of our initial velocity, times time, minus 4.9 t squared, needs to be equal to 10.3.

61
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:47,800
And our goal here is to solve for v sub i. To solve for the magnitude of our initial velocity.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,133
Well what we could do here is solve for t here, in terms of v sub i,

63
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:57,959
the substitute back in here, then solve for that v, that, that necessary initial velocity, or the

64
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,696
magnitude of it. So, to solve for t here, pretty straight forward, you just divide both sides

65
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:12,667
by square root of 2 over 2 v sub i, square root of 3 v sub i, these guys over here cancel out,

66
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,267
and you get t is equal to 96 over all of this business, which is the same thing as saying

67
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:25,000
t is equal to, t is equal to, dividing by square root of 2 over 2 is the same thing as multiplying by

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,267
2 over the square root of 2, which is really just the square root of 2. So let me just do that.

69
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,067
This right over here, I'll write it over here, so 96 over the square root of 2 over 2, is equal to

70
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:43,377
96 times 2 over the square root of 2. And 2 divided by the square root of two is just

71
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:51,200
the square root of 2. So this simplifies to 96 square roots of 2. 96 square roots of 2 over our initial

72
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,704
velocity. And now we can take this, and we can substitute it back into this other constraint,

73
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:00,200
where every time we see a t, and then we'll have one equation with one unknown.

74
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:07,067
We will get, we will get square root of two...I'll do that in blue.

75
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:15,444
We will get square root of 2 over 2 times the magnitude of our initial velocity time time.

76
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:18,733
We just figured out that time is all of this business over here, so it's times

77
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:33,695
96 times the square root of 2 over v sub i, minus 4.9, times t squared. Minus 4.9 times t squared.

78
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:39,200
Well what's t squared? T squared is the same thing as this thing squared, so it's minus 4.9

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:51,867
times 96 squared, times square root of 2 squared, so that's just 2, all of that over v sub i squared.

80
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,867
Did I do that right? Yeah, if I square this I get 96 squared, times square root of 2 squared,

81
00:07:55,867 --> 00:08:01,533
which is just 2, over v sub i squared, and then that, it needs to be equal to, that needs to be equal

82
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:06,733
to 10.3. And now we just need to solve for v sub i. It might look daunting, but it's not going to be

83
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:11,533
as bad, if we just keep, if we keep our heads down and we focus on the problem at hand, I guess.

84
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,630
So the first thing to simplify: we have a v sub i in the numerator and one in the denominator,

85
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,972
these 2 cancel out, and then we have a square root of 2 times a square root of 2,

86
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:25,777
square root of 2 times a square root of 2 is just 2, and we have a 2 in the numerator and a 2 in the

87
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:32,133
denominator, that cancels out. So this whole first term gets simplified to 96, which is nice. So that

88
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:38,400
is 96, and then we have minus all of this business over v sub i squared, so let's figure out what all

89
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:48,333
of that business is. Let's just multiply it out, get the calculator. So I have 4.9 times 96 squared,

90
00:08:48,355 --> 00:09:13,753
times 2, which gives me 90316, which is about right, because this will be about 10000. And so yep, 90316. So minus, minus 90316 divided by v sub i squared, is equal to,

91
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:20,267
is equal to 10.3. And now we know that, just to simplify, let's just multiply everything times

92
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:27,542
v sub i squared, we get 96 times the initial magnitude of our initial velocity squared, minus

93
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:34,600
90316...alright, that's the whole point behind multiplying everything times this, so this, so it's not

94
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:45,133
in the denominator anymore, is equal to 10.3 times v sub i squared. And now we can, let's, let's do a

95
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:52,829
couple of interesting things here, let's add, well let me just subtract 10.3 v sub i squared

96
00:09:52,829 --> 00:10:01,838
from both sides, minus 10.3 v sub i squared, and lets add 90316 to both sides.

97
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:12,403
Plus 90316 to both sides, and what do we get? On the left hand side these guys cancel out,

98
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:24,333
if I take 96 minus 10.3, 96 minus 10 is 86, so I wanna subtract another .3, so it's 85.7 v sub i squared

99
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:36,000
is equal to, on this side, these guys cancel out, is equal to, is equal to 90316. Now I can just divide both sides by

100
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:47,267
85.7, 85.7, and I get v sub i squared, and this is the home stretch, is equal to this. Let me get the

101
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:58,843
calculator out again. So it's equal to this quantity divided by 85.7, which is equal to 1053, well let's

102
00:10:58,843 --> 00:11:07,759
just say 1053, or 1054 if we round. So 1054. This is going to be meters squared per seconds squared.

103
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,600
We didn't write the units, but then to solve for v sub i we just take the square root of both sides.

104
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,133
So v sub i is going to be the principal root of this, so let's just take the square root of that.

105
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:29,842
The square root of that gives us 32.5. 32.5. 32.5. And we're done! This is going to be in meters per

106
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:34,267
second, so those are the units that we've been handling, we've been handling with kilometer--I'm sorry,

107
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:39,400
with meters and seconds and all of the rest, and so that's the velocity that the ball, the magnitude

108
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,800
of that initial velocity! When you get stuck in the math you sometimes forget what we're even doing!

109
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,000
But if you hit something at 32 meters per second at a 45 degree angle, one meter above home plate,

110
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,009
one meter above home plate, in Fenway Park in this direction, you will just cross, or you will just hit

111
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:03,511
the top of the Green Monster. So if you go any bit faster than that, so if you were to go, if you were

112
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:07,600
to go 33 meters per second, and we assume that the air resistance is negligible and it's not slowing

113
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,267
you down, you will be able to cross the Green Monster. At an optimal angle of 45 degrees.

114
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:17,000
If you're angle isn't optimal, you would have to put some more velocity onto that thing. Or put a little

115
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,867
more magnitude on that thing, I should say. And, just for fun, if you want to, you might want to convert

116
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:26,533
this into kilometers per hour or miles per hour. That may give you a more tangible, a more tangible

117
00:12:26,533 --> 99:59:59,999
sense for how hard you have to hit that ball.
