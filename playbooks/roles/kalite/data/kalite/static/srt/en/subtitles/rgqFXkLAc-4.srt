1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,440
Let's a review a little bit
of what we've gone over.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,880
And I think it helps to see the
whole process again, just

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,140
so it really sinks into your
brain and I've drawn the banks

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,770
in a different arrangement
this time.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,880
But just as a review, this
is a bank with a

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,070
little bit less reserves.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,930
The green right here
is their reserves.

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,590
It could either be deposits at
the federal reserve or these

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,660
could actually be federal
reserve notes-- and we all

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,810
know that as dollars or cash.

12
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,000
This is another bank with
slightly more reserves.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,920
And just like I said in the last
video, I'm drawing the

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,740
reserves at the top of the asset
side now so that we can

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,760
compare it directly with the
demand deposits or the

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,900
liabilities of this bank.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,850
Most banks have other
liabilities, but I've just

18
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,690
assumed that all of them
are demand deposit.

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,020
That's this magenta
square here.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,440
And of course their equity
is the blue right there.

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,780
Let me make sure I have it.

22
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,290
That's their equity.

23
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,900
And of course if these are
either federal reserve notes

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,880
or these are deposits within the
reserve bank, those are of

25
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,880
course liabilities for the
reserve bank itself.

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,099
So let me draw a line
from there to there.

27
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,430
This is a liability for
the reserve bank.

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,230
If these were deposits, if these
were essentially demand

29
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,680
accounts with the reserve
bank, then we could even

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,790
divide them up a little bit and
separate-- OK, this guy

31
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,840
has this much-- I don't know
if you can see that.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
That color's not so good.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,700
This guy has this much.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,620
This guy has this much, but if
these are all federal reserve

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,930
notes, they kind of all come
out of the same bucket.

36
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,090
What we learned in the last
video is that the federal

37
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,720
reserve-- they don't say,
we want the money

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,630
supply to be X or Y.

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,140
They always talk about in
terms of interest rates.

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,160
They always say, our target
interest rate or the federal

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,005
reserve rate is now
going to be X.

42
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,650
Let's go over our mechanics a
little bit more on how open

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,900
market transactions help to
make those rates happen.

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,100
So let's say that on day one
or before the fed does

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,000
anything, this bank has a little
bit extra reserves,

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,300
this bank has a little
bit less reserves.

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,980
So there's a couple things that
this bank could do with

48
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,320
these extra reserves.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,400
It could either do some more
lending-- so it could

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
actually-- because it's
reserve-- let's say it's at a

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,180
20% reserve ratio.

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,460
This ratio to this is 20%.

53
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,670
And it can be as low as-- it
would feel comfortable being

54
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,060
at a 15% reserve ratio.

55
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,330
So roughly a fourth of its
reserves could be used for

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,260
doing something else.

57
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,470
And what could it be used for?

58
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,180
So let's say this portion of its
reserves could be used for

59
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,260
something else.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,920
Well, it could lend them
to another bank

61
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,220
who maybe needs reserves.

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,820
So that could be this
right here.

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,980
This bank maybe wants some
reserves and then it would add

64
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,130
it up on here.

65
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,250
The last video, I filled in the
reserves down here, but

66
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,470
actually they're not replacing
other assets.

67
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,130
They would have actually just
been added to the balance

68
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,570
sheet of the bank.

69
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,960
So I should have drawn them on
top and I'll do that a second.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,880
But the other option that this
bank could do is that they

71
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,720
could actually do
more lending.

72
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,860
Since the reserve ratio is
higher than they want, they

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
can actually create checking
accounts like we saw on the

74
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,610
last couple of videos.

75
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,810
With that said, let's say that
this guy wants to borrow some.

76
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,620
This guy's willing to lend some,
although that's not his

77
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,010
only alternative.

78
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,830
He could create checking
accounts essentially with it

79
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,190
and do some more lending
with it.

80
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,600
And let's say in this reality
right now given how much

81
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,100
reserves are on the banking
system at the current rate--

82
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,650
let me write that right here.

83
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,510
The current rate is 6%.

84
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,015
Now the federal reserve
says, you know what?

85
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,680
I would like to expand
the money supply.

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
And they don't say
it directly.

87
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,740
They don't tell us in
our newspapers.

88
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,450
They don't make a press release
saying, we would like

89
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,210
the official M1 value of the
money supply to go from $15

90
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,870
trillion to $20 trillion.

91
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,990
They don't say that.

92
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,920
They say, we are going
to lower the federal

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,850
funds rate to 5%.

94
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:03,350
So let's say they want a federal
funds rate-- they are

95
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,010
setting to be 5%.

96
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,370
The governors of the federal
reserve bank sit together and

97
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,680
Bernanke comes out and says,
we're lowering the federal

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
funds rate to 5%.

99
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,310
So what that 5% percent
means is that their

100
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,240
target rate is now 5%.

101
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,490
So this is a target.

102
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,810
   

103
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,940
So what they're saying is, we
are going to perform open

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,760
market transactions in such a
way that now when this bank

105
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,040
offers money to this bank it's
going to reduce its rate from

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,550
6% to 5%-- or another way to
put it, they're going to do

107
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,730
open market transactions or
operations in such a way that

108
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,210
the demand might also go down
for the reserves so this guy

109
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,680
might be willing to pay less for
borrowing from this guy;

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,260
instead of being willing
to pay 6%, he'll be

111
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,660
willing to pay 5%.

112
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,180
Remember, on any transaction,
both people

113
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
have to agree on it.

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,140
So how do they do that?

115
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,370
And I think we've we're
reasonably familiar with the

116
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,050
mechanics now.

117
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,980
So what the federal reserve
could do is they can print

118
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,230
some notes.

119
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,230
   

120
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,620
Those are assets because
they haven't done

121
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,870
anything with them yet.

122
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,340
   

123
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,990
And then there's a corresponding
liability.

124
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,040
I'll do that in a slightly
different shade of green.

125
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,665
   

126
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:19,780
These are notes outstanding,
right?

127
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,120
See, I should've done all this
in this darker shade of green.

128
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,570
These are the liabilities.

129
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,290
The light green are the assets,
the notes themselves.

130
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,720
And what the federal reserve
does-- because they don't want

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,850
to become an insolvent bank.

132
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,960
They want to buy the most
liquid, safest assets out

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,080
there and it actually makes a
lot of sense and we'll touch

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,820
on this in a lot of
different ways.

135
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,875
What they say is, we're going to
take this money and inject

136
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,820
it into the system by buying
treasuries with it.

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,640
And they could be buying those
treasuries from your

138
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,040
grandmother, they could be
buying it from China, they

139
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,890
could be buying it from Russia,
they could be buying

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,030
it from me, they could be
buying it from my uncle.

141
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,280
Regardless of who they buy it
from-- let's say they buy it

142
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,820
from someone in the U.S.
so that we don't get

143
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,160
confused right now.

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,380
Let's say they buy
it from my uncle.

145
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,940
So this is my uncle.

146
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,230
Let me see if I can draw him.

147
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,900
   

148
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,740
He's holding a treasury right
now-- an IOU from the

149
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,790
government.

150
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,870
That's what he has.

151
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,620
He wasn't willing to sell it
before, but let's say the

152
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,850
federal reserve has printed
more money and he's like,

153
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,840
well, I'm not going to sell it
now, but if someone's willing

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
to offer me a little bit more
money for it, maybe I'm

155
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,050
willing to part with
my treasury bill.

156
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,130
So the federal reserve-- and
he doesn't know that he's

157
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,150
selling it to the
federal reserve.

158
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,600
He just sees selling it to
market, the same way that when

159
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,380
you buy a stock, you don't know
who you're buying it from

160
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,400
or who you're selling
it to and all that.

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,660
So all of a sudden someone goes
out there and is willing

162
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,380
to pay a slightly higher price
for these treasury bills,

163
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,130
these IOUs from the government
and he's like, oh, fine.

164
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah, that's a good price.

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,850
I'm going to sell them to
whoever's buying it.

166
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,390
It turns out that it's actually
the federal reserve

167
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,410
that's buying it.

168
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,430
So the federal reserve all of a
sudden has-- my uncle would

169
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,270
be a big time operator if
the federal reserve

170
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,930
only bought from him.

171
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,700
He would have to have hundreds
of billions of dollars of

172
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,710
these things.

173
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,810
And he doesn't have
his IOU anymore.

174
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,530
What does he have right now?

175
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,010
That IOU is now exchanged for
a dollar bill or hundreds of

176
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,940
billions of dollar bills or
reserve deposits at the

177
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,910
federal reserve-- all the same,
but just to keep the

178
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,280
abstraction solid for right now,
we'll keep it in terms of

179
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:27,780
dollar bills.

180
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,300
So his IOUs he's sold
in exchange for

181
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,870
these dollar bills.

182
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,150
And what does he do with them?

183
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,490
This is hundreds of billions
of dollars.

184
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,150
He's not going to stuff it
all into his mattress.

185
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,050
He's going to deposit it into
the banking system.

186
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,830
So maybe he gives a little
bit to this bank up here.

187
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,310
This is a slight mistake that
I did in the last video.

188
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,060
I was adding it below,
but it's not

189
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,700
replacing other assets.

190
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,460
It's new assets.

191
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,230
So let's say he put some of it
here-- my uncle after he sold

192
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,080
his treasuries.

193
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,060
Let's say he put some of it in
this bank-- or maybe it's a

194
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,400
bunch of people's uncles
and they all don't

195
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,720
go to the same bank.

196
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,900
Let me do that in a slightly
different shade of green, just

197
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,370
so you know this is--
I'll do in blue.

198
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,150
Just so you know, this is a new
deposit, but it's close

199
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,560
enough to green that I think
you get the idea.

200
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,980
And of course, he has an off
setting-- his checking account

201
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,390
if he didn't have one already.

202
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,150
Now he has one so their
liabilities

203
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,400
increase a little bit.

204
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,260
   

205
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,620
So a couple of things
will happen.

206
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,160
Just in terms of how does this
affect the rate that they're

207
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,060
charging to each other?

208
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,570
Well, now all of a sudden, this
bank's reserve ratio's

209
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,560
gotten a little bit better.

210
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,929
His assets and his liabilities
increased, right?

211
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,400
His assets increased by the
amount of my uncle's deposit,

212
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,460
but so did the liabilities
because he's

213
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,690
had the demand deposit.

214
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,090
But it came in a ratio
of reserves to

215
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,490
demand deposit 100%.

216
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,050
So this would have improved
his reserve ratio.

217
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,760
If you now take the ratio of
this height to this height,

218
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,220
it's not going to improve
a little bit, right?

219
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,480
So now he doesn't need money--
this bank doesn't need money

220
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,030
as bad in order to improve
its reserve ratio.

221
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,850
And likewise, this bank now
even has an even better

222
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,460
reserve ratio.

223
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,520
He already had more reserves
than he needed and

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,570
now he got even more.

225
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,950
He has an even better
reserve ratio.

226
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,610
So now this guy's demand for
reserves is a little bit lower

227
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,400
and this guy's supply
of reserves is

228
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,630
a little bit higher.

229
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,190
So this guy's only going to be
willing to pay a little bit

230
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,190
less for new reserves
from this bank.

231
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,500
And this guy, he's willing
to charge less now

232
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,300
because he has more.

233
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,430
He doesn't know what
to do with it.

234
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,750
He doesn't know enough people
who want to borrow more money

235
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,060
so he wants actually lend off
some of his reserves.

236
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,230
So just by increasing the
supply of reserves and

237
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,210
decreasing the demand of
reserve, the current rate-- if

238
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,960
the fed does this
appropriately-- will go to 5%.

239
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,340
And let's say it only went to
5-1/2%, then the fed will keep

240
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,440
doing this and then
it'll go to 5%.

241
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,860
If it goes too far, if it goes
to 4-1/2%, maybe the fed will

242
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,690
reverse the transaction.

243
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,170
The fed will actually go
out there and sell

244
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,240
these treasury notes.

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,160
But I also want to make it clear
that the point of this--

246
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,990
although it does affect the
interest rates and that's what

247
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,610
the federal reserve always talks
about in terms of their

248
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,870
target rates-- the net effect
of injecting more reserves

249
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,750
into the system is it increases
the lending

250
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,790
power of the bank.

251
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,300
And if we have, let's say, a
10% reserve ratio, every

252
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,780
dollar that is injected into
the banking system right

253
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,800
there, that bank can then
do $10 worth of lending.

254
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,220
Let's say that bank lent
it all to this bank.

255
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,700
Let's say he lends all of that--
so now this turns to an

256
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,490
asset, which is a loan
to this bank.

257
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,220
So this bank then has--
this isn't a

258
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,290
demand deposit anymore.

259
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,250
This is now a loan
from this bank.

260
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,970
He has more reserves now.

261
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,880
That's his reserves.

262
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,360
I shouldn't be doing it
in that purple color.

263
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,730
I should be sticking to green.

264
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,330
But the bottom line is, wherever
those reserves are,

265
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,920
doesn't matter which banks they
sit in, but every dollar

266
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,700
of that increased reserves
enables $10 of lending, right?

267
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,570
This bank now can create $10 of
checking accounts through

268
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:12,160
lending and so even though the
federal reserve talks in terms

269
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
of interest rates-- and I'll
talk a lot about why they're

270
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,990
more focused on interest rates
than absolute measures of the

271
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,510
money supply-- even though they
talk in terms of interest

272
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,630
rates, by performing these open
market transactions that

273
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,150
in effect lower the interest
rate by increasing the amount

274
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,980
of reserves out there, they're
actually increasing banks'

275
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,130
lending capacity.

276
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,610
So the amount of reserves--
that's base money-- or you

277
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,670
could almost view it as the
liability side of the federal

278
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,420
funds, the reserve deposits.

279
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,200
That's base money.

280
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
That's M0.

281
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,450
And you get a multiplier effect
for M1, which is the

282
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,490
amount of demand deposits
because in this bank it got

283
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,430
more reserves and then it can
create a bunch of demand

284
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,320
deposits like we learned
earlier.

285
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,650
So by saying that they're
lowering the rates, they're

286
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,320
essentially saying that they're
going to perform open

287
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,490
market transactions that will
inject reserves into the

288
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,510
banking system, which will
allow them to keep their

289
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,460
reserve ratios in line, but
make a lot more loans.

290
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,380
So significantly increase the M1
and then the other, looser,

291
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,700
the broader definitions
of money supply.

292
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,500
I will see you in
the next video.
