1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,590
In this video, we're going to
explore how we can start with

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,840
acetic acid.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,870
   

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,420
And acetic acid looks
like this.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,490
   

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:25,220
And end up with acetyl chloride
that looks like this.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,730
   

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,210
And it's going to
be done in the

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,520
presence of thionyl chloride.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,080
And thionyl chloride, we haven't
seen it before, but it

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,980
just looks like this.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,930
It's a sulfur double bonded
to an oxygen.

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,130
And then, it has single bonds
to two separate chlorines.

15
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,080
And then, if you want
to care, sulphur

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,830
has six valence electrons.

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,720
So it has another lone
pair right over here.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,760
And we'll focus on this.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
Because this is really the
simplest reaction of starting

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,610
with a carboxylic acid and
forming a acyl halide.

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,520
And it can be generalized
very easily.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,160
If you turn this methyl group
into just a larger chain, and

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,599
then this will be a larger
chain right here.

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,000
And, instead of having a
chlorine here, you could do it

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,670
with other halides as well.

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,070
So let's think about how
this might occur.

27
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,460
So let's have our acetic
acid right over here.

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,010
   

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,045
And then, you have this oxygen
bonded to a hydrogen.

30
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:26,980
   

31
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,550
Now, this guy has got
two lone pairs.

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,950
And then the thionyl chloride--
I'll redraw the

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,320
thionyl chloride right
over here.

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,760
And I'll set it up in
the right position.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,600
The thionyl chloride
looks like this.

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,270
And this has a lone pair of
electrons right over here.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,580
And all of these molecules,
chlorine, and oxygen-- or all

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,570
of these atoms-- chlorine and
oxygen-- we can look at a

39
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,220
periodic table up here.

40
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,020
You see sulphur over here.

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,260
And then, to the right of
sulphur is chlorine.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,020
And above sulphur is oxygen.

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,660
So both chlorine and
oxygen are more

44
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,980
electronegative than sulfur.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,470
So sulphur is going to have a
partial positive charge there,

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,710
even though sulphur is a
reasonably electronegative

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,790
atom in its own right.

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,170
But these other guys are
going to be sucking

49
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,180
electronic away from it.

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:25,200
So you could imagine this entire
molecule could act as a

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,720
nucleophile, with this oxygen,
right over here, giving an

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,970
electron to the sulphur.

53
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,470
Sulphur is an electronegative
atom, but it has a partial

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,950
positive charge in just
this thionyl cholride.

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,590
So it will be attracted there.

56
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,060
And then this guy is going to
have to give up an electron.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,280
And he'll give it back to
this oxygen up there.

58
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
And so that will be-- and
this reaction could

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,480
go in either direction.

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,530
So, once again, I'll draw
it in equilibrium.

61
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,020
But right after that happens,
we'll have this, I guess we

62
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,520
could call it a complex, that
will look like this.

63
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,320
This oxygen, it had
two lone pairs.

64
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,560
It had one pair, two pairs.

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,370
And now, it has a third pair,
because it got this electron.

66
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,870
It always had that other
electron in the covalent bond.

67
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,090
And now, it has a
negative charge.

68
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,425
And now, the sulphur is bonded
to those two chlorines.

69
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:20,450
   

70
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,890
And then, it is also bonded
to this oxygen over here.

71
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,000
So let me draw it over here.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,550
So we have this oxygen, which
is bonded to this carbonyl

73
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,790
carbon, just like that.

74
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,410
And then, it is bonded to a
hydrogen right over there.

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,940
It has one lone pair now.

76
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,380
And the other lone pair is, now,
turned into a covalent

77
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,880
bond with the sulfur.

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,390
   

79
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,470
And so this guy gave
away an electron.

80
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,755
So he now has a positive
charge.

81
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:53,930
   

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,850
Now, the next step, you could
imagine that this oxygen says,

83
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,610
hey, I liked having a double
bond with the sulfur.

84
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,360
The sulfur is still bonded to
a bunch of things that are

85
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,380
more electronegative to it.

86
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,430
It still has a slightly
positive charge there.

87
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,730
So you could imagine that this
electron gets given back to

88
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,470
the sulfur.

89
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,070
But then, the sulfur needs
to bump an electron.

90
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,850
Chlorine is pretty
electronegative, so one of

91
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,900
these chlorines will be able
to take away an electron.

92
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,620
So this chlorine could take
away an electron.

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,980
So then, after that happens,
our situation-- and once

94
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,700
again, this is in equilibrium--
our situation

95
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,856
will look like this.

96
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:40,780
Let me draw.

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,420
So let me draw the original
acetic acid.

98
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,810
Or the part that was part of
the original acetic acid.

99
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,140
And so you have this oxygen,
right over here, bonded to a

100
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,670
hydrogen, bonded to-- let me do
it in the same color so we

101
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:02,190
can keep track of things--
bonded to this sulphur right

102
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,590
over here, which now has a
double bond, which, now again,

103
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,140
has a double bond with
this oxygen up here.

104
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,810
So I'll do it in that
same color.

105
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,080
It's still bonded to that
chlorine up there.

106
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,690
   

107
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,840
But now, this chlorine
is left.

108
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,170
It has taken that electron
with it.

109
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,310
So the chlorine had 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7 valence electrons.

110
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,920
It gained this electron,
this orange electron.

111
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,410
So now, it has a negative
charge.

112
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,110
And, by the way, this
guy never lost

113
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,350
his positive charge.

114
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,260
Still has a positive
charge like that.

115
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,460
Now, the chlorine could act
as a nucleophile on

116
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,990
the carbonyl carbon.

117
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,080
This guy is bonded to two
oxygens, more elctronegative,

118
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,770
partially positive charge.

119
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,340
This guy can give an electron
to the carbonyl carbon.

120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,590
And right as that happens, this
is a nucleophilc attack,

121
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,720
the carbonyl carbon can
give up an electron to

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,200
the carbonyl oxygen.

123
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,040
And then, we will be
in equilibrium.

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,380
So make sure you realize we're
going to the right then down.

125
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,810
Now, we're going to the
left with this thing.

126
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,350
So this was the carbonyl carbon
bonded to this oxygen

127
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,330
right now, which now, just
took another electron.

128
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,310
So now, it has a negative
charge.

129
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,930
It had 1, 2 lone pairs.

130
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,880
And now, it will have one
more lone pair because

131
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,740
it took that electron.

132
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,770
It always had this
end of that bond.

133
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,310
So now it has both of these
electrons over here.

134
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,390
It has a negative charge.

135
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,310
It gained an electron.

136
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,595
And then, it is bonded it to
this OH group right over here.

137
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:50,730
   

138
00:06:50,730 --> 00:07:00,250
And then that is bonded to the
sulfur, which is bonded to the

139
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,120
chlorine, and now double bonded
to that other oxygen.

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
Of course, we have this chlorine
over here that did

141
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,100
the nucleophilic attack.

142
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,610
So you have this chlorine
over here.

143
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,550
And this nucleophilc attack,
it gave an electron to what

144
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,390
was this carbonyl carbon.

145
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,300
It gave an electron.

146
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,740
So it is now neutral.

147
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,250
And you can kind of imagine that
this negative charge got

148
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,590
transferred to this
oxygen up here.

149
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,670
And this oxygen, right here,
still has a positive charge.

150
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,280
Don't want to forget that.

151
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,180
Now, the next step that could
happen-- once again, all these

152
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,080
can go in either direction-- is
that this guy doesn't like

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
having a negative charge.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,020
And this guy is still going to
have a partially positive

155
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,430
charge, because he's bonded
to a bunch of more

156
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,810
electronegative atoms
than itself.

157
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,280
So he wants to reform
the double bond.

158
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,650
And that kicks off all of
this business over here.

159
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,630
So then this-- let me do
this in a new color.

160
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,140
I've already used the magenta.

161
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,400
I'll use the pink.

162
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,630
This electron, right here, gets
taken back by this oxygen

163
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,120
that had a positive
charge anyway.

164
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,740
So it would want to
take it back.

165
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,190
And then we are left with-- and
we're getting pretty close

166
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,340
to the punchline.

167
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,180
We are, then, in equilibrium.

168
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,950
This part over here will
then look like this.

169
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,060
We now have reformed
our double bond.

170
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,840
It is only going to
be bonded to the

171
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,270
chlorine, just like this.

172
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,370
And this whole part over here
on the right has broken off.

173
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,740
So you have this oxygen bonded--
let me do it in the

174
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,419
same colors.

175
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,549
You have this oxygen bonded
to a hydrogen.

176
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,459
It now gained an electron.

177
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,010
   

178
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,350
So it is now neutral.

179
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,970
And it is bonded
to this sulfur.

180
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,720
The sulphur is in green.

181
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,400
It's bonded to the sulfur, which
is bonded to a chlorine.

182
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,290
And then, it has a double
bond to this

183
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,600
oxygen right over here.

184
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
So we've already formed
our acetyl chloride.

185
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,660
   

186
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,460
And we've really finished with
the hard part of the

187
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,180
reaction-- to see that how you
could get an acetyl chloride.

188
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,670
And then to kind of complete
this reaction-- because if you

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,040
actually perform this in a
beaker, you'll end up with

190
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,910
some hydrogen chloride and
some sulfur oxide as a

191
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,100
by-product.

192
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,790
You could imagine that this
oxygen, right over here, takes

193
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,190
back its electron from
this proton,

194
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,120
gives it to this sulfur.

195
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
And then, the sulfur, since it
got an electron, will allow

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,740
the electronegative chlorine
to take back its electron.

197
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,840
And then, if we just focus on
this, the acetyl chloride, at

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,950
this point, isn't doing
anything anymore.

199
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,070
This would be in equilibrium
with something

200
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,330
that looks like this.

201
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,365
You now have a hydrogen proton
floating around.

202
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:03,570
   

203
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,290
Just a naked proton, really.

204
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,400
There's not even any
neutrons there.

205
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,100
You have this oxygen,
which is now double

206
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,170
bonded with this sulfur.

207
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,560
So I'm going to try to keep all
of the colors the same.

208
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,730
This, right here, was yellow.

209
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,070
And then, that original bond
it had with it was magenta.

210
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,730
And then, you have the chlorine
nabbed that electron.

211
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:33,810
   

212
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,990
And it already had seven
valence electrons.

213
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. it now
has a negative charge.

214
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,470
And then, the final step.

215
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,840
So we already have our
sulphur dioxide.

216
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,880
Now, the final step is just the
chlorine giving one of its

217
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,010
electrons to the hydrogen to
form hydrogen chloride.

218
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,080
So then, the final step
is just this.

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,450
   

220
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,730
So when all is said and
done, we end up

221
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,460
with some acetyl chloride.

222
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,200
   

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,020
We end up with some
hydrogen chloride.

224
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,160
   

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,540
And we end up with
sulphur dioxide.

226
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,980
   

227
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,960
Just like that, and
we're done.

228
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,660
And, once again, you can
generalize this to get it

229
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,050
starting with any carboxylic
acid and forming the acyl

230
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,960
halide version of it, or acyl
chloride version, if you want

231
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,150
to stick with a chloride
right over here.

232
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,080
Actually, this, right here,
is acetyl chloride.

233
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,550
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that entertaining.

234
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,067
