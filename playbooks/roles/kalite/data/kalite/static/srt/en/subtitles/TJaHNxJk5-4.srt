1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,067
Solve the following application problem using three equations with three unknowns.

2
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:11,759
And they tell us the second angle of a triangle is 50 degrees less than 4 times the first angle.

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,805
The third angle is 40 degrees less than the first.

4
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,518
Find the measures of the three angles.

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,625
Let's draw ourselves a triangle here.

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,800
And let's call the first angle "a",

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
the second angle "b",

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,836
and then the third angle "c".

9
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:30,533
And before we even look at these constraints,

10
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:36,277
one property we know of triangles is that the sum of their angles must be 180 degrees.

11
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:43,800
So we know that a + b + c must be equal to 180 degrees.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,867
Now with that out of the way let's look at these other constraints.

13
00:00:46,867 --> 00:01:00,554
So they tell us the second angle of a triangle is 50 degrees less than 4 times the first angle.

14
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,067
So we're saying b is the second angle.

15
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:09,333
So they're second the angle of a triangle is 50 degrees less than 4 times the first angle.

16
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:14,600
So 4 times the first angle would be 4a (we're calling a the first angle).

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,052
So 4 times the first angle is 4a but its 50 degrees less than that

18
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:21,267
so minus 50.

19
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:22,929
Now the next constraint they give us:

20
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,600
the third angle is 40 degrees less than the first.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,600
So the third angle is 40 degrees less than the first.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,179
So the first angle is a and it's going to be 40 degrees less than that.

23
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:39,533
So we have 3 equations with 3 unknowns

24
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,308
and so we just have to solve for them.

25
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:44,662
Let's see, what's a good first variable to try to eliminate.

26
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:47,098
And just to try to visualize that a little bit better,

27
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:53,267
I'm going to bring these a's onto the left-hand side of each of these equations over here.

28
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,138
So I'm going to rewrite the first equation.

29
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:56,064
We have

30
00:01:56,064 --> 00:02:01,205
a + b + c = 180

31
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:07,148
and then this equation, if we subtract 4a from both sides of this equation we have

32
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:16,831
-4a + b = -50.

33
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,236
And then this equation right over here,

34
00:02:19,236 --> 00:02:21,800
if we subtract a from both sides we get

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:34,052
-a + c = -40.

36
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,667
I just subtracted a from both sides.

37
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:39,200
So we now want to eliminate variables.

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,400
And we already have this third equation here is only in terms of a and c,

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,933
this is only in terms of a and b,

40
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:46,133
and this first one is in terms of a, b and c.

41
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,867
Let's see, this is already in terms of a and c;

42
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:51,800
if we could turn these first two equations,

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,333
if we could use the information in these first two equations to end up with an equation that's only in

44
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:02,667
terms of a and c, then we could use whatever we end up with along with this third equation right over

45
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,836
here and we'll have a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns.

46
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,333
So let's do that.

47
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,082
So if we wanted to just end up with an equation

48
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:14,533
only in terms of a and c using only these first 2, we would want to eliminate the b's...

49
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,200
so we could multiply one of these equations time negative 1

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
and one of these positives b's would turn into a negative b.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,133
So let's do that. Let's multiply this first equation over here times -1.

52
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,228
So it will become

53
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:33,600
-a - b - c = -180,

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,533
and then we have this green equation right over here

55
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,600
which is really just this equation, just rearranged.

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,574
So we have

57
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:46,133
-4a + b = -50

58
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,333
and now we can add these two equations.

59
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:55,800
Actually let me do that in the other color just so you see where that's coming from.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,980
This is

61
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,267
-4a + b = -50.

62
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:03,733
We can add these two up now

63
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,667
and we get

64
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,800
-a - 4a = - 5a,

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,267
the b's cancel out,

66
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,067
we have a minus c,

67
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,964
is equal to

68
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,308
-180 - 50 = -230

69
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:22,667
So now using these top two equations we have an equation only in terms of a and c,

70
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,067
we have another equation only in terms of a and c,

71
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,600
and it looks like if we add them together the c's will cancel out.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,200
So let me just rewrite this equation over here.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,267
And you have to be careful that you're using all of the equations

74
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,267
otherwise you'll kind of do a circular argument.

75
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,733
You have to be careful that over here,

76
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,133
this first equation came from

77
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:39,733
these two over here

78
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,800
Now I want to combine that with this third constraint,

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,533
a constraint that's not already baked into this equation right over here.

80
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:48,338
So we have

81
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:52,749
-a + c = -40

82
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,559
We add these two equations:

83
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:58,667
-5a - a = -6a,

84
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,667
the c's cancel out,

85
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:06,333
and then you have -230 - 40, this is equal to -270,

86
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:11,929
we can divide both sides by -6,

87
00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:18,400
and we get a is equal to -270 over -6.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,667
270 is divisible by both 3 and 2 so it should be divisible by 6,

89
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,800
so let me just divide it;

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,333
the negative signs obviously will cancel,

91
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,467
a negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive.

92
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:36,298
If we take 6 into 270, 6 goes into 27 four time

93
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:38,333
4 x 6 = 24

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,800
we subtract

95
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,067
we get 3, bring down the zero

96
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:45,067
6 goes into 30, 5 times

97
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:52,667
So we get a is equal to 45.

98
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:53,467
Now let's look at the other ones.

99
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,733
We can substitute back into to solve for c.

100
00:05:55,733 --> 00:06:00,846
c is equal to a minus 40 degrees.

101
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:06,600
So that is equal to, in yellow,

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,400
so c is equal to 45 minus 40 which is equal to 5 degrees.

103
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,379
So, so far we have a = 45 degrees,

104
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:23,113
c = 5 degrees,

105
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:27,067
and then you can substitute into either one of these other ones to figure out b.

106
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,400
We can use this one right over here in green:

107
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
b = 4a - 50

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So b is going to be equal to 4 times 45...

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,636
let's see, 2 x 45 is 90, so 4 x 45 is 180

110
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:44,775
so it's going to 180 minus 50 by this equation right over here

111
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:48,600
which is equal to 130 degrees.

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,082
So we get b is equal to 130 degrees.

113
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:54,867
So let me write it right over here.

114
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,067
So a is equal to 45.

115
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:59,600
If I wanted to draw this triangle it would actually look something like this:

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
a is a 45 degree angle,

117
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,769
b is a 130 degree angle,

118
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:08,000
and c is 5.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,487
So it'll look something like this

120
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,667
where this is a at 45 degrees,

121
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,467
b is 135 degrees [oops],

122
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:19,600
and then c is 5 degrees.

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,867
And you can verify that it works.

124
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,533
One, you could just add up the angles

125
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,333
45 + 5 is 50.

126
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,021
Oh, sorry, this isn't 135, it's 130.

127
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,867
We solved it right over here

128
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,169
and this is 5.

129
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,775
So when you add them all up

130
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:38,600
45 + 130 + 5

131
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,933
that does indeed equal 180 degrees;

132
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:43,067
45 + 5 is 50

133
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:46,267
plus 130 so this does definitely equal 180.

134
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,400
So it meets our first constraint.

135
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,533
Then on our second constraint

136
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,800
b needs to be equal to 4a - 50

137
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,667
well 4 x a = 180

138
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:59,133
180 - 50 = 130 degrees

139
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,400
so it meets our second constraint.

140
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
And then our third constraint

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,610
c = a - 40 degrees

142
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,533
Well a is 45, c is 5, so if subtract 40 from 45 you get 5 which is c

143
00:08:11,533 --> 99:59:59,999
so it meets all of our constraints and we are done.
