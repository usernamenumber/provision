1
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:11,687
We're in St Peter's Basilica and we're looking at a famous early Christian sarcophagus.

2
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:14,221
It's the tomb of Junius Bassus.

3
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:20,086
Now it's a little complicated because what people generally see is the copy that the Vatican has

4
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:24,887
in their museum but we're in the Treasury and this is the actual sarcophagus.

5
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:31,341
And so Junius Baccus was a Roman prefect in around the mid-fourth century.

6
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:34,154
Right, we know that he had his position in 359.

7
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:38,902
So we're looking at a very early moment, soon after Constantine has made it

8
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:41,921
legitimate to be a Christian in the Roman Empire

9
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:48,337
and Constantine is in the process of making Christianity or leading towards Christianity becoming the

10
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:52,371
official religion of the Roman Empire which will happen in the end of the 300s.

11
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:59,041
So this is an early example then of a kind of openness and really magnificenct rendering of

12
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,336
the iconography of the Christian tradition.

13
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:05,854
Right, and what's really interesting is that it doesn't look the way we expect it to, in a way because

14
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:13,229
Christ is here in the center represented with probably Peter and Paul, the two figures on either side of them--

15
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,264
It looks likely to be Peter and Paul, yes.

16
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,937
But he looks very youthful, like a young philosopher teacher.

17
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:22,257
He's even holding a scroll in his hand--

18
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:29,303
And he's seated and frontal, though not entirely frontal. So I guess what I'm saying is that things

19
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:34,102
that we normally associate with representations of Christ where he looks like an emperor, he's older

20
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:38,299
and he's got a beard. Here he is represented very youthful,

21
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:44,254
although he's seated and frontal, he does have a kind of naturalism and movement to his body,

22
00:01:44,254 --> 00:01:48,020
his left leg comes forward a little bit, his head is slightly turned.

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,570
And he's got his foot above an image of a river god

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,787
Which is interesting because it shows Christianity surmounting the old

25
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,093
Polytheistic traditions of ancient Romans--

26
00:01:57,093 --> 00:02:05,354
Using the iconography of the ancient Roman, pagan, art in a new Christian context.

27
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:12,177
I really am interested by the point you made earlier about Christ not fulfilling the physical attributes

28
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:18,002
that we come to expect. And this is so early that in a sense, those traditions hadn't yet developed--

29
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:18,944
Exactly.

30
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:23,887
--they hadn't yet really been constructed and accepted so this is a very flexible moment.

31
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:28,269
Right, this iconography is being developed. And here he looks like pagan figure in a way.

32
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,394
That's certainly true because of the classical garb that he wears. And it's interesting stylistically

33
00:02:34,394 --> 00:02:38,637
because this sculpture is really showing a pretty highpitched naturalism

34
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:43,937
in terms of the rendering of the bodies, the contrapposto that we see the figures standing in,

35
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:47,323
and even some of the emotional attributes of the figures.

36
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:53,055
There is a kind of naturalism although we see the beginnings of a kind of early Christian style.

37
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:59,837
There are some hints of what's to come. The heads are a little bit too large for the bodies.

38
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:04,560
The bodies are starting to be a little bit on the stubby side.

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,821
So it's a very interesting transitional moment.

40
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:11,056
We see some other scenes from the bible and we're seeing early expressions of it

41
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:16,716
here but these are ways of representing these scenes that will become very familiar to us.

42
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:19,753
We have Adam and Eve on the lower register--

43
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:26,471
and also other Old Testament scenes that would've prefigured the events in Christ's life.

44
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:32,610
So that idea of saying that events in the Old Testament such as the sacrifice of Isaac prefigured

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:40,336
Christ's own sacrifice for the salvation of mankind so that way of saying that Christ's life

46
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:45,134
is a fulfillment of the prophecy and the events of the Old Testament.

47
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:51,492
What we're witnessing here is the invention of a new iconography, the invention of a new visual language

48
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:54,220
for the tellling of these critical stories.

49
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,604
What I'm also noticing is just how deeply carved it is. It is essentially a relief sculpture

50
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:05,756
but the figures are in very, very high relief. Some of them seem to be separate from

51
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:12,796
the marble ground. And I love these columns with capitals and bringing together of the

52
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:15,457
classical and the beginnings of the Christian.
