1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's do a couple of examples
dealing with angles between

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,800
parallel lines and
transversals.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,430
So let's say that these two
lines are a parallel, so I can

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,680
a label them as being parallel.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,120
That tells us that they will
never intersect; that they're

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,830
sitting in the same plane.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,690
And let's say I have a
transversal right here, which

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,810
is just a line that will
intersect both of those

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:29,930
parallel lines, and I were to
tell you that this angle right

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:39,110
there is 60 degrees and then I
were to ask you what is this

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,790
angle right over there?

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,790
You might say, oh, that's
very difficult; that's

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,540
on a different line.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,160
But you just have to remember,
and the one thing I always

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,480
remember, is that corresponding
angles are always equivalent.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,020
And so if you look at this
angle up here on this top line

18
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,110
where the transversal
intersects the top line, what

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,130
is the corresponding angle to
where the transversal

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,140
intersects this bottom line?

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,810
Well this is kind of the bottom
right angle; you could see

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,870
that there's one, two,
three, four angles.

23
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,800
So this is on the bottom
and kind of to the

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,320
right a little bit.

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
Or maybe you could kind of view
it as the southeast angle

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,560
if we're thinking in
directions that way.

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,930
And so the corresponding
angle is right over here.

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,510
   

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,300
And they're going
to be equivalent.

30
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,910
So this right here
is 60 degrees.

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,950
Now if this angle is 60
degrees, what is the

32
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,570
question mark angle?

33
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,910
Well the question mark angle--
let's call it x --the question

34
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,780
mark angle plus the 60 degree
angle, they go halfway

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,690
around the circle.

36
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,290
They are supplementary; They
will add up to 180 degrees.

37
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,460
So we could write x plus
60 degrees is equal

38
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,300
to 180 degrees.

39
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,760
And if you subtract 60 from
both sides of this equation you

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,515
get x is equal to 120 degrees.

41
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,970
   

42
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,030
And you could keep going.

43
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,080
You could actually figure out
every angle formed between

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,140
the transversals and
the parallel lines.

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,390
If this is 120 degrees,
then the angle opposite to

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,270
it is also 120 degrees.

47
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,580
If this angle is 60 degrees,
then this one right here

48
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,600
is also 60 degrees.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,190
If this is 60, then its
opposite angle is 60 degrees.

50
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,380
And then you could either say
that, hey, this has to be

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,800
supplementary to either this
60 degree or this 60 degree.

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,030
Or you could say that this
angle corresponds to this 120

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,350
degrees, so it is also 120, and
make the same exact argument.

54
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,790
This angle is the same
as this angle, so it

55
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,950
is also 120 degrees.

56
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,460
Let's do another one.

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,660
Let's say I have two lines.

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,550
   

59
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,790
So that's one line.

60
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,270
Let me do that in purple and
let me do the other line in a

61
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,660
different shade of purple.

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,590
Let me darken that other
one a little bit more.

63
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,030
So you have that purple
line and the other one

64
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,860
that's another line.

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,660
That's blue or
something like that.

66
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,200
And then I have a line that
intersects both of them; we

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,305
draw that a little
bit straighter.

68
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:16,590
   

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:25,080
And let's say that this angle
right here is 50 degrees.

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,730
And let's say that I were also
to tell you that this angle

71
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,230
right here is 120 degrees.

72
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,450
Now the question I want to
ask here is, are these

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,220
two lines parallel?

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,230
Is this magenta line and
this blue line parallel?

75
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,420
So the way to think about is
what would have happened

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,960
if they were parallel?

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,840
If they were parallel, then
this and this would be

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,070
corresponding angles, and so
then this would be 50 degrees.

79
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,530
This would have to
be 50 degrees.

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,390
We don't know, so maybe I
should put a little asterisk

81
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,490
there to say, we're not sure
whether that's 50 degrees.

82
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,090
Maybe put a question mark.

83
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,810
This would be 50 degrees if
they were parallel, but this

84
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,020
and this would have to be
supplementary; they would have

85
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,790
to add up to 180 degrees.

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,900
Actually, regardless of whether
the lines are parallel, if I

87
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,380
just take any line and I have
something intersecting, if this

88
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,890
angle is 50 and whatever this
angle would be, they would have

89
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,230
to add up to 180 degrees.

90
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,200
But we see right here that this
will not add up to 180 degrees.

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
50 plus 120 adds up to 170.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,910
So these lines aren't parallel.

93
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,760
Another way you could have
thought about it-- I guess this

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,800
would have maybe been a more
exact way to think about it

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,490
--is if this is 120 degrees,
this angle right here has to be

96
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,420
supplementary to that; it
has to add up to 180.

97
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,290
So this angle-- do it in this
screen --this angle right

98
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,940
here has to be 60 degrees.

99
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,010
Now this angle corresponds
to that angle, but

100
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,930
they're not equal.

101
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,530
The corresponding angles
are not equal, so these

102
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,810
lines are not parallel.

103
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,175
