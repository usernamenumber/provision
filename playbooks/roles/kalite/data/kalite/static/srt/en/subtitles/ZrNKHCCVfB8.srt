1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:04,964
what I have here is a supply and demand curve that represents

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,366
you can view as a model for the housing market

3
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:09,249
or the rental market in a given city

4
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:14,451
this vertical axis right here is the dollar rented in terms of dollar per squared foot per month

5
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:18,416
so if you have a 1000 sqft apartment and the price right over here

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:23,732
that means it's being charged 1000 dollar/ month

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,937
this axis right here is the squared feet per month in terms of

8
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:32,400
million squared feet, so 1 million squared feet, 2 million squared feet, 3 million squared feet and so on

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,484
and like what we have done in the last few videos

10
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:35,539
we have been talking about

11
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,413
consumer and producer surplus.

12
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,920
I want to view the demand curve right over here

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,387
I want to view that as a marginal benefit curve

14
00:00:43,387 --> 00:00:47,554
so, for the very first squared feet right here

15
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:50,748
how much benefit is it for the renters, the consumers.

16
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,217
for them it is a huge benefit.

17
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:56,164
over 4 dollar per foot that is not what they are gonna pay for

18
00:00:56,164 --> 00:01:01,197
but that's what it worth to them. and I am gonna view these this supply curve

19
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:07,397
as a marginal cost curve or the opportunity cost for producing that extra incremental unit.

20
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:10,653
so, right down here. where you have very few squared feet.

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,170
may be the land is cheap for all this land is available

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,486
you just start or the land is most suitable for the building

23
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:23,320
and so the cost, the opportunity cost for supplier that the few squared feet are very low.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,356
so it makes sense that they will supply it

25
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:28,115
because they will produce it. the cost to product it is very low

26
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:30,930
the benefit to the consumers is very high

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,399
so the price, the price is anywhere between these two things

28
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,284
the consumer will get some surplus

29
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:39,205
so the price let's say there

30
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,664
consumer will get some surplus

31
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:43,371
and the producer will get some surplus

32
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,214
right over there. so the market as a whole

33
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:49,229
will get a ton of surplus depending on how it's divided

34
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,245
and now we haven't talked about how that price is

35
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:54,314
just yet, although you see where this is going

36
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,201
so the producer will keep producing more and more units

37
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:01,151
as long as the marginal benefit is higher than the marginal cost

38
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,013
there is this surplus there that can be divided up

39
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:07,132
between the consumers and the suppliers

40
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,255
depending on where the price is.

41
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,949
marginal benefit higher than the marginal cost

42
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,746
marginal benefit marginal cost all the way up to that point

43
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:19,767
all the way till we get to 3,000,000 squared foot per month

44
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:23,083
after that it doesn't make sense if there is some builder

45
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,203
says, hey let me add some more squared feet to the market

46
00:02:25,203 --> 00:02:28,249
this what it costs, it's gonna cost them over 3 dollars

47
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,885
people are not gonna get 3 dollar benefit from those incremental

48
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,929
squared feet. so no one is gonna get it

49
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:36,983
so, no reason for anyone to build beyond that point

50
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:40,301
so that's why this ends up being the equilibrium quantity

51
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:44,954
and the price where that happens

52
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:45,455
the price where that happens, I erase this so we

53
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:49,117
get nice clean numbers, is 3 dollars per squared foot per month

54
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:51,737
now, 3 dollar per squared foot per month is a pretty

55
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,667
pricy rent. if you've got a 1000 squared foot apartment

56
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,533
1000 squared foot that's my old apartment

57
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,833
that's a 2 bedrooms 2 baths apartment

58
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,036
that's roughly $3,000 per month for that apartment

59
00:03:02,036 --> 00:03:04,506
so that's pretty pricy. so this is type of rent that you will see

60
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:07,029
in some places in San Francisco

61
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:11,055
and let's say that the mayor doesn't like this.

62
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,351
this is unaffordable, people aren't gonna be able to live in

63
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:19,768
our city. and so they, institute rent control

64
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:22,700
rent control, which is essentially a price ceiling

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,353
basically the rent per squared foot can not be above

66
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:29,285
a certain amount. that's not normally how rent control is instituted

67
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,630
but just for the sake of our model.

68
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,204
normally they say you can increase rent beyond a certain

69
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:36,616
amount. but let's say rent control. they essentially put

70
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,557
a price ceiling on what rent can be charged

71
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:43,787
so they put a price ceiling, a price ceiling

72
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:49,731
or a rent ceiling. a price ceiling at $2 per squared foot per month

73
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:57,204
$2/sqft/month. so let's think about what's going to happen

74
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:02,865
and also think about what's happening to the total

75
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:04,287
surplus. producer and the consumer surplus. so before

76
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:05,853
actually before we even think about the rent control

77
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,586
let's think about what the total surplus is

78
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,649
you had the consumer surplus. so this is the price right

79
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:15,539
over here. you had a consumer surplus of this area

80
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,650
right over here. and I don't know if this

81
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,531
if this right over here. let's call it 4 and half.

82
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,286
if this is 4.5

83
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:26,135
then this side of the triangle right over here is going to be 1.5

84
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,580
that is 1.5

85
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,622
this right over here is 3,000,000

86
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:36,606
3 million times 1.5 is 4.5 Million

87
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:37,907
and then you divide by 2

88
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:45,236
you get 2.25 million

89
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:52,551
1.5 times one half of 3 you get 2.25 million dollar

90
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:55,036
so in the equilibrium, if you just let the market be

91
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,807
before the rent control, at this equilibrium price and

92
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,320
equilibrium quantity the consumer surplus is $ 2.25 million dollars

93
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,588
that's how much more benefit the consumers are getting collectively

94
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,038
vs what they have to pay for living in that,

95
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,616
living in those houses. the producer surplus, this entire area

96
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:18,515
right over here and if we assume. let's say this right over here

97
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:21,006
i know it doesn't look like, but to make the math easy

98
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:25,452
let's say that is 50 cents

99
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:29,023
so this whole side right over here is gonna be $2.50

100
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:32,161
so this is gonna be 2.5 right over here

101
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:34,208
this length right over here is still 3

102
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,148
so it's gonna be 2.5 times 3 times a half

103
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:40,557
2.5 times 3 will give you the area of the whole

104
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,459
rectangle, you have to multiply by a half to get the area of that triangle

105
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:46,295
so 2 times 3 let me just write this down

106
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:52,043
so it's 2.5 times 3 is, that is 7.5

107
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,841
25 times 3 is 75

108
00:05:53,841 --> 00:06:04,009
and then 75 divide by 2 get you what it's 37.5

109
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:15,287
so this is gonna be 3.75. so this the producer surplus is 3.75 million

110
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,642
so this is $3.75 million dollars

111
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:23,740
and so that's the total value that the producer are getting above and beyond the cost of production

112
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,838
and so the total surplus, the total benefit that the market

113
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:30,288
as a whole if you add the consumer's and the producer's

114
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:34,921
2.25 + 3.75 so that gets us to what

115
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:38,945
that gets us to $6 million dollars of total surplus

116
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:45,826
so there are $6 million dollars total surplus

117
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,213
so that's good

118
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:51,788
because we are at efficient price, efficient equilibrium price

119
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:55,604
and production. we are able to produce all this total surplus.

120
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:58,045
now let's go back to the rent control situation. where

121
00:06:58,045 --> 00:07:04,378
instituting a price ceiling of $2 per squared foot so the price

122
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:09,228
is by government mandate being set at $2 per squared foot

123
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,180
$2/sqft right over there

124
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,494
now if the price is set for $2/sqft, what is the quantity is

125
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:18,446
going to be. how much rent is going to supply

126
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:21,544
if you can only get $2/sqft maybe some of the landlord say

127
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,824
no I will break down this wall and expand my own apartment

128
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,661
or I'm not going to rent these out as much

129
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:28,057
or maybe people who are renting out spared bedroom

130
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,156
say, oh i'm not going to rent out those spared bedrooms

131
00:07:30,156 --> 00:07:32,097
anymore, I'm just gonna keep them as guest's room

132
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:38,476
so the total quantity goes down. total quantity goes down to 2 million squared foot per month

133
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:41,122
now this is a interesting situation. because 2 million squared

134
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:48,191
feet a month. the marginal benefit is much higher than the marginal cost

135
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,894
the marginal benefit of one extra unit is over $3 dollars

136
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:56,179
the marginal cost of an extra unit is right around $2 dollars

137
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:59,243
so in a open market, an efficient market, unfeded market

138
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:03,774
people say, oh, just build more unit because people

139
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,512
are going to get benefit from them and we can have a price

140
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:07,174
between and we both will be ale to experience some surplus

141
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,891
but now you won't. even though there is benefit that's

142
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:13,405
in excess of $3 dollars, because the price can't be higher

143
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,325
than $2 dollars there is no incentive for any of these

144
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:18,746
people to either build more unit or maybe offer the units

145
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:22,779
that they have up for sale. and we shouldn't be talking about

146
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,146
building this for the long run

147
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,513
but even if units are there

148
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:27,836
I won't want to rent my gust's room out because I'm like

149
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:32,758
oh, it's too much of that, I'm not going to get my marginal cost

150
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:35,573
my marginal cost here is over $2 dollars and all I am allowed

151
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:39,362
to get is is $2 dollars. so I don't want to offer that extra unit

152
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:43,509
so what happens in this situation. when the price is set right

153
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,756
over here, the consumers who happen to be able to rent at

154
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:52,278
this price who are able to get these 2 million squared feet

155
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:56,614
per month. they get even larger at least for those 2 million

156
00:08:56,614 --> 00:09:00,572
squared feet. their consumer surplus is this whole thing right

157
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:03,689
over here is this thing right over there

158
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,376
and the producer surplus unambiguously shrinks

159
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,521
producer surplus is this stuff right over here

160
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:13,573
but you see that total surplus is smaller than the total surplus

161
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:17,128
was when we had the unfedded market. we no longer are able

162
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:20,641
to access this part right over here of the surplus.

163
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:25,807
so this right over here you could view this as lost benefit to

164
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:29,828
society. benefit above the cost. lost surplus

165
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:32,911
we call this in economic terms. we call this right over

166
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,878
here: the dead weight loss

167
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:38,347
the dead weight loss

168
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:40,540
this is benefit to the market that could've gone

169
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,924
to either the consumers or the producers that are somehow

170
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,497
are taken away from the market because the market was

171
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:50,839
made less efficient by this artificial price ceiling right over here

172
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,206
and you could measure the dead weight loss

173
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:56,595
once again it's only the area this triangle right over here

174
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,923
and if you say, this right over here,

175
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:03,956
this length right over here is clearly just one

176
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,228
that's one, and if we say that this height

177
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,544
this height right over here it looks like is

178
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:12,991
this is about 1 and half

179
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,243
then the area of this white triangle right over here

180
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:19,690
the dead weight loss is going to be equal to

181
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,155
1 times 1.5 times 0.5.

182
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:29,764
1 times 1.5 is double the area of the triangle

183
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:32,195
you multiply it by a half to get the area

184
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:38,092
so that becomes half times 1.5 which is 0.75

185
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:44,313
so that gives us the dead weight loss that is 0.75 million

186
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:51,058
so 750,000 dollars which is lost to the market

187
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:54,880
so now the total surplus is going to be 750,000 dollars less

188
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,409
than the 6 million dollars

189
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:03,363
so because of that rent control. it will now go down to 5.25 million

190
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:07,000
I took 750,000 out of this. So it might have benefited

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,808
the renters who happened to who are able to get apartments

192
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:14,180
it won't benefit the renters who now they are not going to be

193
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,864
able to find any apartment. it unambiguously reduced the producer's surplus

194
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:27,769
and it reduced the total surplus. the total amount of benefit that the market as a whole was getting

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
end
