1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:05,373
Now that we set up our equation. Let's see if we can answer some more interesting questions.

2
00:00:05,373 --> 00:00:08,564
This is a warm-up. We are gonna do a little bit of what we did in the last video.

3
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:10,212
But I will do it with the equations now.

4
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:15,829
The equations are really just a mathematically representation of the same information that we have up here.

5
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:25,323
As a starting point, let's think about how much, under this basic plan, it will cost for us to attend 3 sessions in a given month.

6
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:40,150
We have our equation right over here. Our total cost in that month is going to be equal to 20 plus 8 times the number of session.

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:47,245
The number of sessions is "s". "s" is 3 in this circumstance. So we replace "s" with the 3.

8
00:00:47,245 --> 00:01:03,968
So we get that our cost is 20 + 8 times 3. Or 20 + 24. Or $44. So it's gonna cost us $44.

9
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:06,472
Now lets do the same under the trial plan

10
00:01:06,472 --> 00:01:11,780
How much is it gonna cost up to attend 3 sessions?

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:21,116
Well, this is more straight forward, our total cost is gonna be equal to 12 times the number of sessions.

12
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:26,050
The number of sessions is 3.

13
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:37,096
so it is 12 times 3, so our total cost is going to be $36.

14
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:41,173
But we could also answer more interesting questions with these equations.

15
00:01:41,173 --> 00:02:00,772
For example, how many sessions can I attend in a month for $54.

16
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:09,807
When I look at my salary and my budget for health and fitness, this is what I can afford. And based on that I wanna ask.

17
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:13,738
How many session can I attend with each of these situations?

18
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:20,172
First let's think about it for the trail plan. How many session can I attend for $54.

19
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:25,571
Now let's just assume that this is some kind of special yoga studio, where

20
00:02:25,571 --> 00:02:33,256
you can even attend a half session and they will just charge you half the cost, 6 dollars. If you attend a 1/4 of a session they charge you 3 dollars.

21
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:38,805
so they keep track of exactly what fraction of a session that you attend.

22
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,125
You don't have to attend a whole number of sessions.

23
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,584
You could attend 2 1/2 and they will bill you accordingly.

24
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:52,821
So with that said, how many session under the trial plan can I attend for $54?

25
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:56,604
Well, lets think about it this a little bit.

26
00:02:56,604 --> 00:03:11,004
So my cost now is 54. 54 is "c". It's my monthly cost. 54 is equal to 12 times the number of session.

27
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:17,925
So now I have set this equation. In order to answer this question. I just need to figure the number of session that satisfy it.

28
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,455
Now this is "s" is an unknown variable.

29
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:25,008
What number of sessions times 12 is equal to 54.

30
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:30,669
Well you might say, if I could just get "s", just the "s" on the right side here, then I have the answer.

31
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,239
"s" will be equal to some value.

32
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,723
And if I want just an "s" on the right hand side, I divide this by 12.

33
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:44,672
12s divided by 12 is s. The number of sessions.

34
00:03:44,672 --> 00:03:52,540
But if I have an equal sign, I can't just willy-nilly divide one side by 12 without doing the exact same thing to the other side.

35
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,996
If that is equal to that, in order for them still be equal we have to do the same thing to both sides.

36
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:08,397
So on the right hand side, I'm left with just an s, and on the left hand side, I have 54 divided by 12.

37
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:16,904
Let me think about that. 12 goes into 54.

38
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:20,574
4 times. 4 times 12 is 48.

39
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,125
You are left with a remainder of 6.

40
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:32,528
So you could say 12 goes into 54. Or you could say 54/12 is equal to 4 and 6/12.

41
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,900
or 4 and a 1/2.

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,866
So the number of session that I can attend are 4 1/2.

43
00:04:39,866 --> 00:04:45,200
If I 54 to spend, I can attend 4 1/2 sessions under the trial plan.

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,862
If this was yoga studio that said, you can't attend half sessions, then

45
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:54,790
it would only be 4 sessions, because 5 sessions would get me above my budget.

46
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,872
But I said you can attend fractional sessions, so it is 4 1/2.

47
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:05,260
Now lets answer the same question for the basic plan.

48
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,208
Under the basic plan how many sessions can I attend for 54 dollars?

49
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:19,106
Once again this will be our total cost for that months, so we say,

50
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:31,502
54 is equal to 20 + 8 times the number os sessions.

51
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:37,071
And once again, I'd like to have just session on the right hand side of this equation.

52
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,373
So I can say session are going to be equal to something.

53
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,824
This is the number of session I can attend.

54
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:46,871
But I have this 20 here and this 8 here, so i have to think about how I can get rid them.

55
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:52,939
So the first thing to think about is how can I get rid of this 20 on the right hand side of this equation?

56
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,036
what am I gonna do to the entire equation?

57
00:05:56,036 --> 00:06:02,842
well the simplest thing, I could subtract 20 from the right hand side, but if subtract 20 from the right hand side,

58
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:07,254
iI also have to subtract from the left hand side to maintain the equality.

59
00:06:07,254 --> 00:06:09,869
And so I'm left with.

60
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,373
on the left hand side: 54 minus 20 gets me 34,

61
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:26,404
and thats equal to 8s,

62
00:06:26,404 --> 00:06:29,891
so 8s has to equal 34

63
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,343
in order for 8 times the number of session plus 20 to be equal to 54

64
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:36,467
and you can add 20 both sides to get the original.

65
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:41,395
So we're almost done, we just need to isolate the s right here and you can imagine that the easiest way

66
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:46,571
would be to divide the right hand side by 8 but if divide the right hand side by 8,

67
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:50,093
we have to do the same to the left.

68
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:54,291
and so what do we for the number of session that we would have to attend?

69
00:06:54,291 --> 00:07:03,595
well, these cancel out, and so you get the number of session is equal to 34/8

70
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,696
34/8 is equal to, lets see.

71
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,759
8 goes into 34 four times with the remainder 2.

72
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,878
so 4 and 2/8.

73
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,159
or it's 4 1/4.

74
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:21,198
So I can attend 4 1/4 session under the basic plan.

75
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:28,638
So assuming I can do fractional session, for which one can attend more sessions in?

76
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:32,579
The basic or the trial plan?

77
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,579
Well for 54 I can attend a slight longer amount of session under the trial plan.
