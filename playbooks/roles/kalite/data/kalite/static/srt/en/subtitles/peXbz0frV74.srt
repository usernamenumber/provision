1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,980
   

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,140
I'm going to do a couple more
moment and force problems,

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,320
especially because I think
I might have bungled the

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,680
terminology in the previous
video because I kept confusing

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,120
clockwise with counterclockwise.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,370
This time I'll try to
be more consistent.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,080
Let me draw my lever again.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,590
My seesaw.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:27,680
So that's my seesaw, and that is
my axis of rotation, or my

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,270
fulcrum, or my pivot point,
whatever you want to call it.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,490
And let me throw a bunch
of forces on there.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,760
So let's say that I have a
10-Newton force and it is at a

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,830
distance of 10, so distance
is equal to 10.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,310
The moment arm distance is 10.

15
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:58,140
Let's say that I have a
50-Newton force and its moment

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,180
arm distance is equal to 8.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,710
Let's say that I have a 5-Newton
force, and its moment

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,292
arm distance is 4.

19
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,360
The distance is equal to 4.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
That's enough for that side.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:31,210
And let's say I have a I'm
going to switch colors.

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,580
Actually, no, I'm going to keep
it all the same color and

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,280
then we'll use colors to
differentiate between

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,960
clockwise and counterclockwise
so I don't bungle

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,300
everything up again.

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,520
So let's say I have a 10-Newton
force here.

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,055
And, of course, these vectors
aren't proportional to

28
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:46,750
actually what I drew.

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,230
50 Newtons would be huge if
these were the actual vectors.

30
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,810
And let's say that that moment
arm distance is 3.

31
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,670
Let me do a couple more.

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,220
And let's say I have a moment
arm distance of 8.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:13,130
I have a clockwise force of 20
Newtons, And let's say at a

34
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,330
distance of 10 again, so
distance is equal to 10, I

35
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,680
have my mystery force.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,010
It's going to act in a
counterclockwise direction and

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,500
I want to know what
it needs to be.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,670
So whenever you do any of
these moment of force

39
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,680
problems, and you say, well,
what does the force need to be

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,340
in order for this see
saw to not rotate?

41
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,490
You just say, well, all the
clockwise moments have to

42
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,800
equal all of the
counterclockwise moments, So

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,500
clockwise moments equal
counterclockwise.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,750
I'll do them in different
colors.

45
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,450
   

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,560
So what are all the
clockwise moments?

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,140
Well, clockwise is this
direction, right?

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,940
That's the way a clock goes.

49
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,052
So this is clockwise,
that is clockwise.

50
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,290
I want to go in this
direction.

51
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,710
And so this is clockwise.

52
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,950
What are all the clockwise
moments?

53
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,450
It's 10 Newtons times its
moment arm distance 10.

54
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,650
So 10 times 10 plus 5 Newtons
times this moment arm distance

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,310
4, plus 5 times 4, plus 20
Newtons times its moment arm

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,200
distance of 8, plus 20 times 8,
and that's going to equal

57
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
the counterclockwise moments,
and so the leftover ones are

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
counterclockwise.

59
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,590
So we have 50 Newtons acting
downward here, and that's

60
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,240
counterclockwise, and it's at
a distance of 8 from the

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,240
moment arm, so 50 times 8.

62
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
Let's see, we don't
have any other

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,890
counterclockwise on that side.

64
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,600
This is counterclockwise,
right?

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,290
We have 10 Newtons acting
in the counterclockwise

66
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,860
direction, and its moment arm
distance is 3, plus 10 times

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,680
3, and we're assuming our
mystery force, which is at a

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,390
distance of 10, is also
counterclockwise,

69
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,000
plus force times 10.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
And now we simplify.

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,630
And I'll just go to a neutral
color because this

72
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,290
is just math now.

73
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,610
100 plus 20 plus 160 is equal
to-- what's 50 times 8?

74
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,220
That's 400 plus 30 plus 10F.

75
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,770
What is this?

76
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,500
2, 50 times 8.

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,470
Right, that's 400.

78
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,480
OK, this is 120 plus
a 160 is 280.

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:41,860
280 is equal to 430-- this is
a good example-- plus 10F, I

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,550
just realized.

81
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,390
Subtract 430 from both sides.

82
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,610
So what's 430 minus 280?

83
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,050
It's 150.

84
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,540
So it's minus 150
is equal to 10F.

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,260
So F is equal to minus
15 Newtons in the

86
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,290
counterclockwise direction.

87
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,240
So F is minus 15 Newtons
in the counterclockwise

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,830
direction, or it means that
it is 15 Newtons.

89
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,620
We assumed that it was in the
counterclockwise direction,

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,790
but when we did the math,
we got a minus number.

91
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,490
[SNEEZE]

92
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,060
Excuse me.

93
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,860
I apologize if I blew out your
speakers with that sneeze.

94
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,740
But anyway, we assume it was
going in the counterclockwise

95
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,330
direction, but when we did the
math, we got a negative

96
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,340
number, so that means it's
actually operating in the

97
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,770
clockwise direction at 15
Newtons at a distance of 10

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,630
from the moment arm.

99
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,160
Hopefully, that one was less
confusing than the last one.

100
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
So let me do another problem,
and these actually used to

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,320
confuse me when I first learned
about moments, but in

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,260
some ways, they're the
most useful ones.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,030
So let's say that I have
some type of table.

104
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,940
I'll draw it in wood.

105
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,190
It's a wood table.

106
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,080
   

107
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,090
That's my table.

108
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,920
And I have a leg here,
I have a leg here.

109
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,720
   

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,020
Let's say that the center
of mass of the top of

111
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,390
the table is here.

112
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,350
It's at the center.

113
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,010
And let's say that
it has a weight.

114
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,410
It has a weight going down.

115
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,370
What's a reasonable weight?

116
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,540
Let's say 20 Newtons.

117
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,480
It has a weight of 20 Newtons.

118
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,510
Let's say that I place some
textbooks on top of this

119
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,310
table, or box, just to make
the drawing simpler.

120
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,470
   

121
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,010
Let's say I place a box there.

122
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,710
   

123
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,140
Let's say the box weighs 10
kilograms, which would be

124
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,350
about 100 Newtons.

125
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:16,050
So let's say it weighs
about 100 Newtons.

126
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,050
So what I want to figure out,
what I need to figure out, is

127
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,090
how much weight is being
put onto each of

128
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,540
the legs of the table?

129
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,460
And this might not have even
been obviously a moment

130
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,820
problem, but you'll see in
a second it really is.

131
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,740
So how do we know that?

132
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,100
Well, both of these legs are
supporting the table, right?

133
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,020
Whatever the table is exerting
downwards, the leg is exerting

134
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,220
upwards, so that's the amount of
force that each of the legs

135
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,120
are holding.

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,930
So what we do is we pick-- so
let's just pick this leg, just

137
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,780
because I'm picking
it arbitrarily.

138
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,040
Let's pick this leg,
and let's pick an

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,340
arbitrary axis of rotation.

140
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,920
Well, let's pick this is as
our axis of rotation.

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,080
Why do I pick that as the
axis of rotation?

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,690
Because think of it this way.

143
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,950
If this leg started pushing more
than it needed to, the

144
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,320
whole table would rotate in the

145
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,390
counterclockwise direction.

146
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,210
Or the other way, if this leg
started to weaken and started

147
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,900
to buckle and couldn't hold
its force, the table would

148
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,130
rotate down this way, and it
would rotate around the other

149
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,760
leg, assuming that the other
leg doesn't fail.

150
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,740
We're assuming that this leg
is just going to do its job

151
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,280
and it's not going to move
one way or the other.

152
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,110
But this leg, that's why we're
thinking about it that way.

153
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,330
If it was too weak, the whole
table would rotate in the

154
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,110
clockwise direction, and if it
was somehow exerting extra

155
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,960
force, which we know a leg
can't, but let's say if it was

156
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,380
a spring or something like that,
then the whole table

157
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,409
would rotate in the
counterclockwise direction.

158
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,560
So once we set that up, we can
actually set this up as a

159
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,120
moment problem.

160
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,450
So what is the force
of the leg?

161
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,470
So the whole table is exerting
some type of-- if this leg

162
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,960
wasn't here, the whole table
would have a net clockwise

163
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,550
moment, right?

164
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,690
The whole table would tilt down
and fall down like that.

165
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,750
So the leg must be exerting a
counterclockwise moment in

166
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,790
order to keep it stationary.

167
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,640
So the leg must be exerting
a force upward right here.

168
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,850
The force of the leg, right?

169
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,400
We know that.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,190
We know that from
basic physics.

171
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,690
There's some force coming down
here and the leg is doing an

172
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,650
equal opposite force upwards.

173
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,260
So what is that force
of that leg?

174
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,740
And one thing I should
have told you

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,720
is all of the distances.

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,310
Let's say that this distance
between this leg and the book

177
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,610
is 1 meter-- or the box.

178
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,550
Let's say that this distance
between the leg and the center

179
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,980
of mass is 2 meters, and so
this is also 2 meters.

180
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,390
OK, so we can now set this
up as a moment problem.

181
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,430
So remember, all of the
clockwise moments have to

182
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,090
equal all of the
counterclockwise moments.

183
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,930
So what are all of the
clockwise moments?

184
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,060
What are all of the things that
want to make the table

185
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,790
rotate this way or this way?

186
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,920
Well, the leg is the
only thing keeping

187
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,400
it from doing that.

188
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,290
So everything else is

189
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,840
essentially a clockwise moment.

190
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,780
So we have this 100 Newtons,
and it is 1 meter away.

191
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,270
Its moment arm distance is 1.

192
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,500
So these are all the clockwise
moments, 100 times 1, right?

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,320
It's 100 Newtons acting
downwards in the clockwise

194
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,710
direction, clockwise moment, and
it's 1 meter away, plus we

195
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,230
have the center of mass at the
top of the table, which is 20

196
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,670
Newtons, plus 20 Newtons, and
that is 2 meters away from our

197
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:44,250
designated axis,
so 20 times 2.

198
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,950
And you might say, well, isn't
this leg exerting some force?

199
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,780
Well, sure it is, but its
distance from our designated

200
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,780
axis is zero, so its moment
of force is zero.

201
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,420
Even if it is exerting a million
pounds or a million

202
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,510
Newtons, its moment of force,
or its torque, would be zero

203
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,470
because its moment arm distance
is zero, so we can

204
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,330
ignore it, which makes
things simple.

205
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,610
So those were the only
clockwise moments.

206
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,490
And what's the counterclockwise
moment?

207
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,350
Well, that's going to be the
force exerted by this leg.

208
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,680
That's what's keeping the whole
thing from rotating.

209
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,480
So it's the force of
the leg times its

210
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,370
distance from our axis.

211
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,770
Well, this is a total of 4
meters, which we've said here,

212
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,020
times 4 meters.

213
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,330
   

214
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,180
And so we can just solve.

215
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,870
We get 100 plus 40, so we get
140 is equal to the force of

216
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,110
the leg times 4.

217
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:48,040
So what's 140-- 4 goes
into 140 35 times?

218
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,430
My math is not so good.

219
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:50,940
Is that right?

220
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,730
4 times 30 is 120.

221
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,690
120 plus 20.

222
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,370
So the force of the leg
is 35 Newtons upwards.

223
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,040
And since this isn't moving,
we know that the downward

224
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,130
force right here must
be 35 Newtons.

225
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,630
And so there's a couple of ways
we can think about it.

226
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:14,950
If this leg is supporting 35
Newtons and we have a total

227
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,850
weight here of 120 Newtons, our
total weight, the weight

228
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,180
at the top of the
table plus the

229
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,270
bookshelf, that's 120 Newtons.

230
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,120
So the balance of this
must be supported by

231
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,820
something or someone.

232
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,060
So the balance of this
is going to be

233
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,830
supported by this leg.

234
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,810
So it's 120 minus 35 is what?

235
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,120
[PHONE RINGS]

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,640
Oh, my phone is ringing.

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,010
120 minus 35 is what?

238
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,710
120 minus 30 is 90.

239
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:46,720
And then 90 minus
5 is 85 Newtons.

240
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,540
It's so disconcerting
when my phone rings.

241
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,340
I have trouble focusing.

242
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,000
Anyway, it's probably because
my phone sounds

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
like a freight train.

244
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,940
Anyway, so there you go.

245
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,800
This type of problem is actually
key to, as you can

246
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,660
imagine, bridge builders, or
furniture manufacturers, or

247
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,730
civil engineers who are bridge
builders, or architects,

248
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,160
because you actually have to
figure out, well, if I design

249
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,650
something a certain way, I have
to figure out how much

250
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:18,160
weight each of the supporting
structures

251
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,650
will have to support.

252
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,920
And as you can imagine,
why is this one

253
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,670
supporting more weight?

254
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,990
Why is this leg supporting more
weight than that leg?

255
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,340
Well, because this book, which
is 100 Newtons, which is a

256
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,680
significant amount of the total
weight, is much closer

257
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,670
to this leg than it
is to this leg.

258
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,290
If we put it to the center, they
would balance, and then

259
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,730
if we push it further to the
right, then this leg would

260
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,310
start bearing more
of the weight.

261
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,310
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting, and

262
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,640
hopefully, I didn't
confuse you.

263
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,160
And I will see you
in future videos.

264
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,400
