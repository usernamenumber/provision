1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:07,481
We're asked to convert pi radians and negative pi/3 radians to degrees.

2
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:08,855
And the first question I'll ask you:

3
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:13,613
If you do one revolution, You have an angle that went all the way around once.

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,867
How many radians is that?

5
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:23,816
Well we know that it is 2 pi radians.

6
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:28,101
Now that exact same angle if we were to measure it in degrees,

7
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,488
How many degrees is that?

8
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:38,189
Well if you were doing degrees, it would be one full revolution. That is equal to 360 degrees

9
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:39,714
Now, can we simplify this?

10
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,701
Thats a bore to write this little, superscript cirsle

11
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,251
That's literally the units of the question.

12
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,468
Sometimes it doesn't look like a unit but it is a unit.

13
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:48,521
You could literally write degrees instead of that little symbol.

14
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:55,337
Now can we simplify this? Well sure,

15
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,783
Both two pi and 360 are divisible by two

16
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,990
so lets divide things by two, and if we do that, what do we get?

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,871
Or what are pi radians equal to?

18
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:09,731
Well on the left side here we're just left with pi radians,

19
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:18,200
and on the righthand side here, 360 divided by two is 180.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,169
And we have still the units which are degrees.

21
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:24,241
So we get pi radians are equal to 180 degrees.

22
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,372
Which actually answers the first part of our question.

23
00:01:26,372 --> 00:01:28,336
We wanted to convert pi radians, well we just figured out!

24
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:37,039
Pi radians are equal to 180 degrees.

25
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:41,398
If you want to think about it, pi radians are halfway around the circle

26
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:47,442
Halfway around the circle like that, and it is the same thing as 180 degrees.

27
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,384
So now lets think about the second part.

28
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:52,884
We want to convertnegative pi over three radians.

29
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:55,720
--Switch to a new color-- so negative pi over three,

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:03,519
so how do we convert that?

31
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,810
So what do we get based on this information right over here.

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,449
Well, to figure this out we need to know how many degrees there are per radian.

33
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:21,017
We need to multiply this by degrees -- I'm going to write the word out instead of the circle here --

34
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:26,799
It would be really hard to visualize that, degrees per radian

35
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,437
So how many degrees are there per radian?

36
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:34,971
well we know that for 180 degrees we have pi radians.

37
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:43,971
Or you can say there are 180 over pi degrees per radian.

38
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,803
This is going to work out:

39
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,593
We have however manyradians we have

40
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:49,082
times the number of degrees per radian.

41
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:54,969
So of course the units are going to work out. The radians cancel out, the pi also cancels.

42
00:02:54,969 --> 00:03:03,702
And you are left with 180 divided by 3, leaving us with

43
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,796
what is that?

44
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:06,863
Negative 60, and we don't want to forget the units

45
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:10,863
We could write them out, the only unit left is degrees. WE could write out the word degrees or just put that symbol there.
