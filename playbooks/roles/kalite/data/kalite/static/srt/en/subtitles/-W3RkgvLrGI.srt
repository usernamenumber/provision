1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
   

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,500
We'll now use that equation we
just derived to go back and

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,980
solve-- or at least address--
that same problem we were

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,510
doing before, so let's write
that equation down again.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,660
Actually, let's write
the problem down.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,140
Lets say I have the cliff
again, and so my initial

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,750
distance is 0, but it goes
down 500 meters.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm not going to redraw the
cliff, because it takes a lot

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,260
of space up on my limited
chalkboard.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,440
We know that the change
in distance is equal

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,659
to minus 500 meters.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,100
I'm still going to use the
example where I don't just

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,070
drop the ball, or the penny, or
whatever I'm throwing off

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,270
the cliff, but I actually throw
it straight up, so it's

15
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,145
going to go up and slow down
from gravity, and then it will

16
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:46,370
go to 0 velocity, and start
accelerating downwards.

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,275
You could even say decelerating

18
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,930
in the other direction.

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:59,780
The initial velocity, vi, is
equal to 30 meters per second,

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,730
and of course, we know that the
acceleration is equal to

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,530
minus 10 meters per second
squared-- it's because

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,200
acceleration gravity is always
pulling downwards, or towards

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,260
the center of our planet.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,150
If we wanted to figure out the
final velocity, we could have

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,150
just used the formula, and we
did this in the last video--

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,340
vf squared is equal to
vi squared plus 2ad.

27
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,900
Now what I want to do is use the
formula that we learned in

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,260
the very last video to figure
out-- how long does it take to

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,680
get to the bottom, and
to hit the ground?

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,350
Let's use that formula: we
derived that the change in

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,720
distance is equal to the initial
velocity times time

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,570
plus acceleration time
squared over 2, and

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,200
that's initial velocity.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,550
The change in distance is minus
500, and that's equal to

35
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,410
the initial velocity-- that's
positive, going upwards, 30

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,300
meters per second, 30t.

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm not going to write the units
right now, because I'll

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,030
run out of space, but you can
redo it with the units, and

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,550
see that the units
do work out.

40
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,009
When you square time, you have
to square the time units,

41
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,792
although we're solving
for time.

42
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:18,250
Then, plus acceleration, and
acceleration is minus 10, and

43
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,850
we're going to divided it by 2,
so it's minus 5t squared.

44
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,520
We have minus 500 is equal to
30t plus minus 5t, and we

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,000
could just say minus
5t squared, and

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,270
get rid of this plus.

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,150
At first, you say, Sal-- there's
a t, that's t to the

48
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,600
first, and t to the second,
how do I saw solve this?

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,310
Hopefully, you've taken algebra
two or algebra one, in

50
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,430
some places, and you remember
how to solve this.

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,310
Otherwise, you're about to learn
the quadratic equation,

52
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,150
although I recommend you go
back, and learn about

53
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,430
factoring in the quadratic
equation, which there are

54
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,280
videos on that I've
put on Youtube.

55
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,570
I hope you watch those first
if you don't remember.

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,080
We can do this-- let's put these
two right terms on the

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,810
left hand side, and then we'll
use the quadratic equation to

58
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,625
solve, because I don't think
this is easy to factor.

59
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:14,020
We'll get 5t squared minus 30t
minus 500 is equal to 0-- I

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,060
just took these terms and put
them on the left side.

61
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,580
We could divide both sides by
5, just to simplify things,

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,740
and so we get t squared minus
6t minus 100 is equal to 0.

63
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,160
I could do that, because 0
divided by 5 is just five, so

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,220
I just cleaned it
up a little bit.

65
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,130
Let's use the quadratic
equation, and for those of us

66
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,840
who need a refresher,
I'll write it down.

67
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,740
The roots of any quadratic--
in this case, it's t we're

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,060
solving for-- t will equal
negative b plus or minus the

69
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:56,770
square root of b squared minus
4ac over 2a, where a is a

70
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,990
coefficient on this term, b is
the coefficient on this term,

71
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,900
negative 6, and c is the
constant, so minus 100.

72
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,830
Let's just solve.

73
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:11,190
We get t is equal to negative
b-- so negative this term.

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,850
This term is negative 6, so if
we make it a negative, it

75
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,380
becomes plus 6.

76
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:23,305
It becomes 6 plus or minus the
square root of b squared, so

77
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:33,130
it's minus 6 squared, 36,
minus 4 times a, and the

78
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,826
coefficient on a is here,
and that's just times 1.

79
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:42,810
With 4ac, c is a constant term,
minus 100, minus 4 times

80
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:51,250
1 times minus 100, and all of
that is over 2a-- a is 1

81
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,010
agains, so all of
that is over 2.

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,140
That just equals 6 plus or minus
the square root-- this

83
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,470
is minus 4 times minus 100, and
these become pluses, so it

84
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,490
becomes 36 plus 400.

85
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:15,180
So, 6 plus or minus
436 divided by 2.

86
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,680
This is not a clean number,
and if you type into a

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,050
calculator, it's something on
the order of about 20.9.

88
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,730
We can just say approximately
21-- you might want to get the

89
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,710
exact number, if you're actually
doing this on a test,

90
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,880
or trying to send something to
Mars, but for our purposes, I

91
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,420
think you'll get the point.

92
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,080
I'll say it approximately now,
because we're going to be a

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,210
little off, but just to have
clean numbers, this is

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,540
approximately 21--
it's like 20.9.

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,260
We'll say 6 plus or minus--
let me just write

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:52,410
20.9-- 20.9 over 2.

97
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,250
Let me ask you a question:
if I do 6 minus

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,940
20.9, what do I get?

99
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,770
I get a negative number,
and does a

100
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,340
negative time make sense?

101
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,120
No, it does not, and that means
that somehow in the

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,100
past-- I don't want to get
philosophical-- the negative

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,360
time in this context will
not make sense.

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,342
Really, we can just stick to the
plus, because 6 minus 20

105
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:20,540
is negative, so there's only one
time that will solve this

106
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,570
in a meaningful way.

107
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,900
Time is approximately equal to
6 plus 20.9, so that's 26.9

108
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:39,690
over 2, and that equals
13.45 seconds.

109
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,670
That's interesting.

110
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,490
I think if you remember way
back, maybe four or five

111
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,110
videos ago, when we first did
this problem, we just dropped

112
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,530
the penny straight
from the height.

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,095
Actually, in that problem, I
gave you the time-- I said it

114
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,790
took 10 seconds to hit the
ground, and we worked

115
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,660
backwards to figure out that the
cliff was 500 meters high.

116
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Now, if you're here at the top
of a 500 cliff, or building,

117
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,970
and you drop something that has
air resistance-- like a

118
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,700
penny, that has very air
resistance-- it would take 10

119
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,060
seconds to reach the ground,
assuming all of our

120
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,000
assumptions about gravity.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,280
But if you were to throw the
penny straight up, off the

122
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,470
edge of the cliff, at 30 meters
per second right here,

123
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,720
it's going to take 13.5--
roughly, 13 and 1/2 seconds--

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,680
to reach the ground.

125
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,460
It takes a little bit longer,
and that should make sense

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,230
because-- I have time to
draw a little picture.

127
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:43,040
In the first case, I just took
the penny, and its motion just

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,220
went straight down.

129
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,310
In the second case, I took the
penny-- it first went up, and

130
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,930
then it went down.

131
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,440
   

132
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,600
It had all the time when it went
up, and then it went down

133
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,310
a longer distance, so it makes
sense that this time-- this

134
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,950
was 10 seconds, while this time
was 13.45 five seconds.

135
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,310
You can kind of say that it
took-- well, you actually

136
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,920
can't say that.

137
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't want to get too
involved, but I hopefully this

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,710
make sense to you.

139
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,620
If you have a smaller number
here, you should have gone and

140
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,600
checked your work, because why
would it take less time when I

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,030
throw the object straight up?

142
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,370
Hopefully, that gave you a
little bit more intuition, and

143
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,620
you really do have in your
arsenal now all of the

144
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,049
equations-- and hopefully, the
intuition you need-- to solve

145
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,480
basic projectile problems.

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,960
I'll now probably do a couple
more videos where I just do a

147
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,580
bunch of problems, just to
really drive the points home.

148
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,570
Then, I'll expand these
problems to two

149
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,700
dimensions and angles.
