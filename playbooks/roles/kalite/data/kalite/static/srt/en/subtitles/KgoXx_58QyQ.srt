1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,940
A local hospital recently
conducted a blood drive where

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,990
they collected a total of 80
pints of blood from donors.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,340
The hospital was hoping to
collect a total of 8 gallons

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,170
of blood from the drive.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,890
Did they meet their goal?

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,490
How much more or less
than their goal did

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,030
the hospital collect?

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,640
So really, they collected
80 pints.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,830
We just need to figure out how
many gallons that is, and then

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,750
say, well, is that going to be
more or less than 8 gallons?

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,000
So we start with 80 pints.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,770
And we can take it
step by step.

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,090
You may or may not know how
many pints there are per

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,415
gallon, so let's just go
straight to quarts first, and

16
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,360
then from quarts we
can go to gallons.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,080
But if you know right from the
get go how many pints there

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,620
are per gallon, you
could go there.

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,310
So let's convert
this to quarts.

20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,430
So we have 80 pints, so what
are we going to multiply or

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,120
divide by to get quarts?

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,650
Well, one way to think about
it, you're going from a

23
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,150
smaller unit, pints, to a larger
unit, so you're going

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,020
to have less of that
larger unit.

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,740
So you're going to divide.

26
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,330
This number's going
to be smaller when

27
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,640
it goes into quarts.

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,610
And it's going to be smaller by
a factor of 2 because you

29
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,850
have 2 pints per quart.

30
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,260
You're not going to
multiply by 2.

31
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,270
You're not going to
have more quarts.

32
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,780
You're going to divide by 2.

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,090
So you could say, times 1/2.

34
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,540
This is the same thing as
dividing by 2, and we'll make

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,560
sure that the units work out.

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,190
We have one quart for every 2
pints, or you can view this as

37
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,150
2 pints per quart or 1/2
of a quart per pint.

38
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,950
Either way, the units work out,
and you're essentially

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,560
taking 80 and dividing by 2, or
multiplying by 1/2, and you

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,690
get 40 quarts.

41
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,700
And I want to make sure that
your brain does it both ways.

42
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,180
Because when you're just doing
it, you don't have paper, you

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,640
don't have the units around, you
should just think, hey, 80

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,540
pints, there's 2 pints
per quart.

45
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm going to have half
as many quarts.

46
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,710
I'm going to have 40 quarts.

47
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,980
But when problems get a little
bit more complicated, it is

48
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,750
nice to make sure that the units
cancel out in this way,

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,370
so that you know, OK,
1 quart is 2 pints.

50
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,090
Pints in the denominator, pints
in the numerator, cancel

51
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,080
them out, and I'm just left with
quarts, and 80 times 1/2,

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,890
which is 40.

53
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,840
So we have 40 quarts
now, and now we can

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,170
convert this to gallons.

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,620
We know that there are 4 quarts
per gallon or that 1

56
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,120
gallon has 4 quarts.

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,310
And once again, we're going to
go from a smaller unit to a

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,920
larger unit, to gallons.

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,070
So we know there's a factor
of 4 difference.

60
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,090
Since you're going to a larger
unit, your brain should say,

61
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,460
hey, I'm going to divide by 4.

62
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,710
I'm going to have a factor 4
fewer gallons because it's a

63
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,820
larger unit.

64
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,540
And to make sure that units work
out, you just remember,

65
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,070
well, we have quarts up here in
the numerator, you're going

66
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,590
to want quarts down here
in the denominator.

67
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,610
And we care about converting
into gallons, and

68
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,820
1 gallon is 4 quarts.

69
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,850
And this will work out.

70
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,380
The quarts will cancel out.

71
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,600
And notice, you're also
dividing by 4.

72
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,110
40 times 1/4 is the exact same
thing as 40 divided by 4,

73
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,900
which makes sense.

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,730
We're going to a larger unit.

75
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:01,270
So 40 times 1/4 is 10, and the
units left are gallons.

76
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,620
So the 80 pints of blood
that the hospital

77
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,320
collected is 10 gallons.

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,480
Their goal was only 8 gallons.

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,020
   

80
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,390
So did they meet their goal?

81
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,920
Yes, they met their goal!

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,460
How much more or less
than their goal did

83
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
the hospital collect?

84
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,220
Well, their goal was 8,
they collected 10.

85
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,080
They collected 2 extra gallons
than their goal.

86
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,399
