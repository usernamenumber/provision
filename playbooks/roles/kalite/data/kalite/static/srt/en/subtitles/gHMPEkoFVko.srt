We're asked to prove that triangle ADC is congruent to triangle BEC

2
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:09,522
so this left triangle is congruent to this right triangle.

3
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:11,925
The figure is not drawn to scale.

4
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,300
We should never assume that it is.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,433
And then we have some givens here:

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:23,106
they tell us that segment AC is congruent to BC

7
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:28,435
and they also tell us that CD is congruent to CE

8
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:33,581
I've got to mark it twice because CD is not necessarily the length of AC

9
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,419
In fact, they don't look anywhere close, so we can't assume it.

10
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:45,767
So what else can we figure out about this little diagram here in order to be able to say this left triangle is congruent to the right?

11
00:00:45,767 --> 00:01:07,792
Well the one thing we know is that angle ACD is congruent to angle BCE

12
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,839
and we can say that because they are vertical angles.

13
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:13,511
vertical angles are equal

14
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:20,325
And now we can, I think that's enough information to say that they are congruent.

15
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:31,520
We can now say that triangle ADC is congruent to triangle BEC.

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,260
And we know that because we have a side, an angle, and a side.

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,602
So by side angle side congruence

18
00:01:47,818 --> 00:01:52,367
And so I think I am done, let me check my answer here.

19
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,605
Drumroll please. . . and it worked!
