1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:03,423
Let's now account for the same series of events

2
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:05,209
but instead of doing it on a cash basis

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,808
let's do it on an accrual basis. And the whole idea

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:11,158
with accrual accounting, is to match your revenues and expenses

5
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:13,400
to when you actually perform the service,

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,585
so it actual captures a business activity,

7
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:20,475
as opposed to just capturing when cash changes hands.

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,257
So let's see what that actually means.

9
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:25,834
So in month 1 you cater an even where the cost to you was $100

10
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:28,977
The customer pays you $200 for your services

11
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:31,225
And what I'll do, I'll do the accrual accounting right here

12
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:33,297
So this kind of the cash income statement,

13
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,591
let's do the accrual accounting income statement.

14
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:40,259
So you actually provided the service of catering,

15
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:43,923
you got $200 for your services, so I'll put $200

16
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,559
in for revenue.

17
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,927
And the expenses associated with that service

18
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:53,027
that you provided in month 1 is $100.

19
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:56,212
And so your profit is $100.

20
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:00,404
So at least for month 1, the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting

21
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,580
look exactly the same. And once again

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,327
you have $100 in cash. Now let's go to month 2:

23
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:11,148
You cater an event where the cost to you was $200

24
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:14,161
You and the customer agree that they can pay you $400

25
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,993
the next month. So now it get's interesting,

26
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,232
because you performed the catering that month

27
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:20,938
and the catering you performed that month is

28
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:25,254
worth $400. So in the accrual basis of accounting,

29
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:32,810
you would say that you earned $400 of revenue in this month.

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,888
Even though the customer did not pay you,

31
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,438
they did not give you the cash.

32
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:39,376
The way that you account for that,

33
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,625
is on your balance sheet, you say that you are

34
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,979
essentially owed $400, so this accounts receivable

35
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,460
this is essential stuff that other people owe you,

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,378
you need to receive this from other people,

37
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:53,737
but it's an asset, other people have an obligation to you

38
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:57,142
So you have accounts receivable of $400

39
00:01:57,142 --> 00:02:01,009
When they pay you the $400, it goes from accounts receivable to

40
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,853
cash. And then the cost to you was $200.

41
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:11,307
So the cost to you was $200. So here all of a sudden,

42
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:12,792
you performed the service,

43
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,677
the revenues and expenses for that service

44
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,517
are in that month, and now your profit here

45
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:20,809
shows $200, so it is actually a better reflection

46
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:23,126
of what you did that month.

47
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,623
Now, the reality is you didn't get the cash forward,

48
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:29,544
and you had to spend $200 of cash out of your pocket,

49
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,770
so you're still, just like the cash accounting,

50
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:40,027
you're still going to have negative $100 in cash.

51
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,910
Now let's go to month 3.

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,309
You get $400 from the customer the previous month.

53
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:48,505
Now, with cash basis, you would have added that to your revenue,

54
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:51,980
but here, we already accounted for it in the accounts receivable,

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,492
we already took that revenue.

56
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:56,087
But because you've got the $400 in cash, it's going to

57
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:59,305
disappear from receivables, and then go into cash,

58
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,809
cause you actually got it.

59
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,270
You get $400 from the customer in the previous month.

60
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:08,148
You also get $200 in advance from a customer that you have to cater for next month

61
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:10,460
So you did no catering in month 3,

62
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,582
and because you did no catering in month 3,

63
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:17,703
you have 0 revenue in month 3, and then you also have 0 expenses,

64
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:21,693
the way that you account for the $400 that you got,

65
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,965
is that your accounts receivables goes to 0,

66
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:29,107
and that goes to cash, so the negative $100

67
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:32,947
you add $400 to it, so it becomes positive $300.

68
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,974
And the way that you account for this $200 in advance

69
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:40,259
from a customer, is you call that deferred revenue.

70
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,792
You got the cash there, so we went from negative $100

71
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,545
added $400 to $300 and you had another $200 in cash,

72
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:51,743
so that gives us $500 in cash again,

73
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,562
but we didn't earn any revenue,

74
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:57,005
that $200, that was a kind of cash advance,

75
00:03:57,005 --> 00:03:59,571
so we put that right over here in deferred revenue,

76
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:03,597
that's revenue that we're deferring to a future period,

77
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:06,756
in the future we will earn, this is now a liability

78
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,426
because we were obligated to earn that revenue.

79
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:12,385
And then in month 4 we actually earned the revenue.

80
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,210
So in month 4, we can actually put it in our income statement

81
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,681
at $200, and then we had $100 of expenses,

82
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:24,992
so that we have this $100 right over here.

83
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:29,542
And so in month 4 we earned $100,

84
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:34,645
and once again, $100 went away from our cash balance,

85
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:37,019
so we still have $400.

86
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,722
So whether you do the cash basis or accrual basis

87
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,024
you have the same exact amount of cash,

88
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:45,245
what's more interesting is how the profit

89
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,601
relates in each of the periods,

90
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:49,137
and I'll talk about that in a little more depth

91
00:04:49,137 --> 99:59:59,999
in the next video.
