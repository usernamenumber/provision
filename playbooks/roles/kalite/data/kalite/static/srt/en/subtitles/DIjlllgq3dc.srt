1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,390
To win a particular lottery
game, a player chooses 4

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,490
numbers from 1 to 60.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,490
Each number can only
be chosen once.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,040
If all 4 numbers match the 4
winning numbers, regardless of

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,149
order, the player wins.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,340
What is the probability that the
winning numbers are 3, 15,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,550
46, and 49?

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,920
So the way to think about this
problem, they say that we're

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,330
going to choose four
numbers from 60.

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,600
So one way to think about it
is, how many different

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,230
outcomes are there if we choose
four numbers out of 60?

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,610
Now this is equivalent to
saying, how many combinations

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,080
are there if we have 60 items?

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,990
In this case we have 60 numbers,
and we are going to

16
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,770
choose four.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,050
And we don't care
about the order.

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,170
That's why we're dealing
with combinations, not

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,900
permutations.

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,660
We don't care about the order.

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,310
So how many different groups of
four can we pick out of 60?

22
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,460
And we don't care what order
we picked them in.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,810
And we've seen in previous
videos that there is a formula

24
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,920
here, but it's important to
understand the reasoning

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,459
behind the formula.

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,210
I'll write the formula here,
but we'll think about what

27
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,660
it's actually saying.

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:18,560
So this is 60 factorial over 60
minus 4 factorial, divided

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,080
also by 4 factorial,
or the denominator

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,620
multiplied by 4 factorial.

31
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,135
So this is the formula
right here.

32
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:28,370
But what this is really saying,
this part right here,

33
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,640
60 factorial divided by 60 minus
4 factorial, that's just

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,720
60 times 59, times
58, times 57.

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,100
That's what this expression
right here is.

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,050
And if you think about it, the
first number you pick--

37
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,170
there's 1 of 60 numbers, but
then that number is kind of

38
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,100
out of the game.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,340
Then you can pick from 1 of
59, then from 1 of 58,

40
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,840
then of 1 of 57.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,010
So if you cared about order,
this is the number of

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,830
permutations.

43
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,620
You could pick four items out of
60 without replacing them.

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,860
Now, this is when you cared
about order, but you're

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,169
overcounting because it's
counting different

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,930
permutations that are
essentially the same

47
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,760
combination, essentially the
same set of four numbers.

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,220
And that's why we're dividing
by 4 factorial here.

49
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,840
Because 4 factorial is
essentially the number of ways

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,250
that four numbers can be
arranged in four places.

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,530
Right?

52
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,800
The first number can be in one
of four slots, the second in

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,860
one of three, then
two, then one.

54
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,090
That's why you're dividing
by 4 factorial.

55
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,830
But anyway, let's just
evaluate this.

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,200
This'll tell us how many
possible outcomes are there

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
for the lottery game.

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,150
So this is equal to-- we already
said the blue part is

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:52,110
equivalent to 60 times 59,
times 58, times 57.

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,540
So that's literally 60
factorial divided by

61
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,410
essentially 56 factorial.

62
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,210
And then you have your 4
factorial over here, which is

63
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,320
4 times 3, times 2, times 1.

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,830
And we could simplify it a
little bit just before we

65
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,150
break out the calculator.

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,020
60 divided by 4 is 15.

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,235
And then let's see, 15
divided by 3 is 5.

68
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,650
   

69
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,910
And let's see, we have a
58 divided by 2 is 29.

70
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:34,460
So our answer is going to be 5
times 59, times 29, times 57.

71
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,520
Now this isn't going
to be our answer.

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,720
This is going to be the number
of combinations we can get if

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,950
we choose four numbers
out of 60 and we

74
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,090
don't care about order.

75
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,710
So let's take the calculator
out now.

76
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:54,950
So we have 5 times 59,
times 29, times 57.

77
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,590
It's equal to 487,635.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,720
So let me write that down.

79
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:16,450
That is 487,635 combinations.

80
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,810
If you're picking four numbers,
you're choosing four

81
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,270
numbers out of 60, or
60 choose four.

82
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,670
Now, the question they say is,
what is the probability that

83
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:29,090
the winning numbers are
3, 15, 46, and 49?

84
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,420
Well, this is just one
particular of the

85
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,620
combinations.

86
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:40,850
This is just one of the 487,635
possible outcomes.

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:51,020
So the probability of 3, 15, 46,
49 winning is just equal

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:58,670
to-- well, this is just one of
the outcomes out of 487,635.

89
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,890
So that right there is your
probability of winning.

90
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,860
This is one outcome out of all
the potential outcomes or

91
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,070
combinations when you take 60
and you choose four from that.

92
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,333
