1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,670
In this video, we're going to
learn to divide polynomials,

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,230
and sometimes this is called
algebraic long division.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,550
But you'll see what
I'm talking about

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,330
when we do a few examples.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's say I just want to
divide 2x plus 4 and

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,230
divide it by 2.

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,680
We're not really changing
the value.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,790
We're just changing how we're
going to express the value.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,600
So we already know how
to simplify this.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,810
We've done this in the past. We
could divide the numerator

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,490
and the denominator by
2, and then this

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,100
would be equal to what?

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,250
This would be equal to x plus
2-- let me write it this way--

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,490
it would be equal to, if
you divide this by 2,

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,340
it becomes an x.

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,650
You divide the 4 by
2, it becomes a 2.

18
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,880
If you divide the 2
by 2, you get a 1.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,380
So this is equal to x plus
2, which is pretty

20
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,910
straightforward, I think.

21
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,500
The other way is you could have
factored a 2 out of here,

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,175
and then those would
have canceled out.

23
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:56,830
But I'll also show you how to
do it using algebraic long

24
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,100
division, which is a bit of
overkill for this problem.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,130
But I just want to show you that
it's not fundamentally

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,640
anything new.

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,300
It's just a different way of
doing things, but it's useful

28
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,180
for more complicated problems.

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,610
So you could have also written
this as 2 goes into 2x plus 4

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,070
how many times?

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,300
And you would perform this
the same way you would do

32
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,020
traditional long division.

33
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,780
You'd say 2-- you always start
with the highest degree term.

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,840
2 goes into the highest
degree term.

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,350
You would ignore the 4.

36
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,050
2 goes into 2x how many times?

37
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,770
Well, it goes into 2x
x times and you put

38
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,962
the x in the x place.

39
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,070
x times 2 is 2x.

40
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,673
And just like traditional long
division, you now subtract.

41
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:39,440
   

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,490
So 2x plus 4 minus 2x is what?

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,550
It's 4, right?

44
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,740
And then 2 goes into
4 how many times?

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,810
It goes into it two times,
a positive two times.

46
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,050
Put that in the constants
place.

47
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,240
2 times 2 is 4.

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
You subtract, remainder 0.

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,530
So this might seem overkill
for what was probably a

50
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,140
problem that you already
knew how to do and

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,410
do it in a few steps.

52
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,240
We're now going to see
that this is a very

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,970
generalizable process.

54
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,140
You can do this really for any
degree polynomial dividing

55
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,070
into any other degree
polynomial.

56
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,850
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

57
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:29,980
So let's say we wanted to divide
x plus 1 into x squared

58
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,260
plus 3x plus 6.

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,780
So what do we do here?

60
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,050
So you look at the highest
degree term here, which is an

61
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,030
x, and you look at the highest
degree term here,

62
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,550
which is an x squared.

63
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,140
So you can ignore
everything else.

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,530
And that really simplifies
the process.

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,280
You say x goes into x squared
how many times?

66
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,040
Well, x squared divided by x is
just x, right? x goes into

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,900
x squared x times.

68
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,730
You put it in the x place.

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,270
This is the x place right
here or the x to

70
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,000
the first power place.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,350
So x times x plus 1 is what?

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,722
x times x is x squared.

73
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:15,810
x times 1 is x, so it's
x squared plus x.

74
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,080
And just like we did over
here, we now subtract.

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,220
And what do we get?

76
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,350
x squared plus 3x plus 6 minus
x squared-- let me be very

77
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,630
careful-- this is minus
x squared plus x.

78
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,030
I want to make sure that
negative sign only-- it

79
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,030
applies to this whole thing.

80
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,810
So x squared minus x squared,
those cancel out.

81
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,020
3x, this is going
to be a minus x.

82
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
Let me put that sign there.

83
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,410
So this is minus x squared minus
x, just to be clear.

84
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,250
We're subtracting
the whole thing.

85
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,720
3x minus x is 2x.

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,880
And then you bring down the 6,
or 6 minus 0 is nothing.

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,030
So 2x plus 6.

88
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,220
Now, you look at the highest
degree term, an x and a 2x.

89
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,530
How many times does
x go into 2x?

90
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,290
It goes into it two times.

91
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,660
2 times x is 2x.

92
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,673
2 times 1 is 2.

93
00:04:11,673 --> 00:04:15,090
   

94
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,790
So we get 2 times x plus
1 is 2x plus 2.

95
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,120
But we're going to want to
subtract this from this up

96
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,900
here, so we're going
to subtract it.

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,240
Instead of writing 2x plus 2,
we could just write negative

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,330
2x minus 2 and then add them.

99
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,850
These guys cancel out.

100
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,780
6 minus 2 is 4.

101
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,620
And how many times
does x go into 4?

102
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,320
We could just say that's zero
times, or we could say that 4

103
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,570
is the remainder.

104
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:45,410
   

105
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:55,680
So if we wanted to rewrite x
squared plus 3x plus 6 over x

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,160
plus 1-- notice, this is the
same thing as x squared plus

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,980
3x plus 6 divided by x plus 1,
this thing divided by this, we

108
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,640
can now say that this is
equal to x plus 2.

109
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,130
it is equal to x plus 2 plus
the remainder divided by x

110
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,820
plus 1 plus 4 over x plus 1.

111
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,530
This right here and this right
here are equivalent.

112
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,690
And if you wanted to check that,
if you wanted to go from

113
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,130
this back to that, what you
could do is multiply this by x

114
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,120
plus 1 over x plus 1
and it add the two.

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,780
So this is the same
thing as x plus 2.

116
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,240
And I'm just going to multiply
that times x plus

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,770
1 over x plus 1.

118
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,500
That's just multiplying
it by 1.

119
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,440
And then to that, add
4 over x plus 1.

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,870
I did that so I have the same
common denominator.

121
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,820
And when you perform this
addition right here, when you

122
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,050
multiply these two binomials
and then add the 4 up here,

123
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,690
you should you get x squared
plus 3x plus 6.

124
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,540
Let's do another one of these.

125
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,070
They're kind of fun.

126
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:18,020
So let's say that we have-- we
want to simplify x squared

127
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:26,310
plus 5x plus 4 over x plus 4.

128
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,930
So once again, we can do our
algebraic long division.

129
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:43,410
We can divide x plus 4 into
x squared plus 5x plus 4.

130
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,610
And once again, same
exact process.

131
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,690
Look at the highest degree terms
in both of them. x goes

132
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,120
into x squared how many times?

133
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,390
It goes into it x times.

134
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,790
Put it in the x place.

135
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,230
This is our x place
right here.

136
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,820
X times x is x squared.

137
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,440
x times 4 is 4x.

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,060
And then, of course, we're
going to want to subtract

139
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,990
these from there.

140
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,750
So let me just put a negative
sign there.

141
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,240
And then these cancel out.

142
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,540
5x minus 4x is x.

143
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,800
4 minus 0 is plus 4.

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,940
x plus 4, and then you could
even see this coming.

145
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,190
You could say x plus 4 goes into
x plus 4 obviously one

146
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,770
time, or if you were not looking
at the constant terms,

147
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,770
you would completely just
say, well, x goes

148
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,300
into x how many times?

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,770
Well, one time.

150
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,580
Plus 1.

151
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,140
1 times x is x.

152
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,260
1 times 4 is 4.

153
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,430
We're going to subtract them
from up here, so it cancels

154
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,540
out, so we have no remainder.

155
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,410
So this right here simplifies
to-- this is

156
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,000
equal to x plus 1.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
And there's other ways you
could have done this.

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,980
We could have tried to factor
this numerator.

159
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:58,200
x squared plus 5x plus
4 over x plus 4.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,270
This is the same
thing as what?

161
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,190
We could have factored this
numerator as x plus 4

162
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,910
times x plus 1.

163
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,380
4 times 1 is 4.

164
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:12,980
4 plus 1 is 5, all of
that over x plus 4.

165
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,700
That cancels out and you're
left just with x plus 1.

166
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,400
Either way would have worked,
but the algebraic long

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,630
division will always work, even
if you can't cancel out

168
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,920
factors like that, even if
you did have a remainder.

169
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,870
In this situation, you didn't.

170
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,830
So this was equal to x plus 1.

171
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,159
Let's do another one of these
just to make sure that you

172
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,690
really-- because this is
actually a very, very useful

173
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,650
skill to have in your toolkit.

174
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:49,030
So let's say we have
x squared-- let me

175
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,730
just change it up.

176
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,850
Let's say we had 2x squared--
I could really make these

177
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,950
numbers up on the fly.

178
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:01,280
2x squared minus 20x plus 12
divided by-- actually, let's

179
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,800
make it really interesting, just
to show you that it'll

180
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,510
always work.

181
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,830
I want to go above quadratic.

182
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:15,860
So let's say we have 3x to the
third minus 2x squared plus 7x

183
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:24,590
minus 4, and we want to divide
that by x squared plus 1.

184
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,880
I just made this up.

185
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,980
But we can just do the algebraic
long division to

186
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,470
figure out what this is going
to be or what this

187
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,280
simplified will be.

188
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,250
x squared plus 1 divided into
this thing up here, 3x to the

189
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:46,140
third minus 2x squared
plus 7x minus 4.

190
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,790
Once again, look at the
highest degree term.

191
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,010
x squared goes into 3x to the
third how many times?

192
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,930
Well, it's going to go
into it 3x times.

193
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,830
You multiply 3x times this,
you get 3x to the third.

194
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,930
So it's going to go
into it 3x times.

195
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,885
So you have to write the 3x over
here in the x terms. So

196
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:09,000
it's going to go into it 3x
times, just like that.

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,380
Now let's multiply.

198
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,130
3x times x squared is 3x
to the third, right?

199
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,820
3x times squared plus
3x times 1.

200
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,350
So we have a 3x over here.

201
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm making sure to put
it in the x place.

202
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,440
And we're going to want
to subtract them.

203
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,090
And what do we have?

204
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,000
What do we have when
we do that?

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,060
These cancel out.

206
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,090
We have a minus 2x squared.

207
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,890
And then 7x minus-- because I
just subtracted 0 from there--

208
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,830
7x minus 3x is plus 4x,
and we have a minus 4.

209
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,140
Once again, look at the
highest degree term.

210
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,450
x squared and a negative
2x squared.

211
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,210
So x squared goes
into negative 2x

212
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,960
squared negative 2 times.

213
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,450
Negative 2, put it in
the constants place.

214
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:02,430
Negative 2 times x squared
is negative 2x squared.

215
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,370
Negative 2 times 1
is negative 2.

216
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,490
   

217
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,820
Now, we're going to want to
subtract these from there, so

218
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,100
let's multiply them
by negative 1, or

219
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,460
those become a positive.

220
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,800
These two guys cancel out.

221
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,520
4x minus 0 is-- let me switch
colors-- 4x minus 0 is 4x.

222
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,470
Negative 4 minus negative 2 or
negative 4 plus 2 is equal to

223
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,340
negative 2.

224
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,385
And then x squared, now it has
a higher degree than 4x, and

225
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:39,463
the highest degree here, so we
view this as the remainder.

226
00:11:39,463 --> 00:11:45,450
   

227
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,430
So this expression we could
rewrite it as being equal to

228
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:57,490
3x minus 2-- that's the 3x minus
2-- plus our remainder

229
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,425
4x minus 2, all of that
over x squared plus 1.

230
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:06,150
   

231
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,150
Hopefully, you found that
as fun as I did.
