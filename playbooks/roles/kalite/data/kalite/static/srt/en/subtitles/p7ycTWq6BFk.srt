1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,410
Let's graph another rational
function, because you really

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,270
can't get enough
practice here.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:12,690
So let's say we have y is equal
to x over x squared

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,510
minus x minus 6.

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,000
So the first thing we might want
to do is just factor this

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,680
denominator so we can identify
our vertical asymptotes, if

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,880
there are any.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,190
So what two numbers when I
take their product I get

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,880
negative 6 and if I add them
up I get negative 1?

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,810
So they have to be of
different signs.

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,510
So one's going to be a plus and
one-- let me write my x's

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,940
a little bit neater than that--
so one is going to be a

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,470
positive and one is going
to be a negative.

15
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,240
A 2 and a 3 seem to be pretty
close, because they're one

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,890
apart, and I'm going to subtract
the larger number

17
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,830
because when I add them,
I get a negative.

18
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,780
So x minus 3 times x plus
2 seems to work.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,250
That gets negative 6.

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,150
Negative 3x plus 2x.

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,830
negative 3 times x
plus 2 times x is

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,970
negative x, so that works.

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:10,140
So this is equal to x over
x plus 2 times x minus 3.

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,930
And like we saw in the last
video, since these

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,590
expressions, since the x plus
2 doesn't cancel out with

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,290
anything in the numerator and
the x minus 3 doesn't cancel

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,820
out with anything in the
numerator, we know that these

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,100
can be used to find our
vertical asymptotes.

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,940
The vertical asymptotes are when
either that term is equal

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,070
to zero or when that term is
equal to zero, because at

31
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,670
those points, our equation
is undefined.

32
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,640
So this is equal to zero when x
is equal to negative 2, and

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,900
this is equal to zero when
x is equal to positive 3.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,060
And you could try it out here.

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,890
If x is equal to negative 2 or
positive 3, you're going to

36
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,490
get a zero in the

37
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,310
denonminator, y will be undefined.

38
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,940
So vertical asymptotes at x
is equal to negative 2.

39
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,930
So there's a vertical asymptote,
a vertical

40
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,650
asymptote right there.

41
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,940
Another vertical asymptote
is x is equal to 3.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,050
One, two, three.

43
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,410
There is our other vertical
asymptote.

44
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,840
Now let's think about horizontal
asymptotes, or if

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,650
there are any.

46
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,470
So what happens as x gets
super-positive or

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,290
super-negative?

48
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,090
And as we said before, you
just have to look at the

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,560
highest degree term on the
numerator and the highest

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,350
degree term on the
denominator.

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,990
Now, notice the highest degree
term on the denominator is x

52
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,400
squared, while the highest
degree term on the numerator

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,870
is only an x.

54
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,680
So when x gets really large,
what's going to happen?

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,850
You could imagine, this is going
to be like a million

56
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,260
over a million squared, which
is still one over a million.

57
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,470
These terms over here
don't matter much.

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,850
But this term right here is
going to grow faster than

59
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,350
everything.

60
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,060
This is an x squared term.

61
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,480
As x gets large, it's going
to get way larger than

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,550
everything, including this
term on the top, so it's

63
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,230
essentially going
to go to zero.

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,080
When the denominator just gets
bigger, faster than the

65
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,340
numerator as you're going
to approach zero.

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,745
So we have a horizontal
asymptote at y is equal to 0.

67
00:03:08,745 --> 00:03:11,900
   

68
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,490
I could draw it as a dotted
line over our x-axis.

69
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,530
So that right there is the
line, y is equal to 0.

70
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,760
Once again, we identify that
looking at the highest degree

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,630
term there.

72
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,700
The denominator has a
higher-degree term, so it's

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,590
going to grow faster
than the numerator.

74
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,250
You could try it out
on your calculator.

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,450
And that's true whether you
go in the super-negative

76
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,120
direction or the super-positive
direction.

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,030
This thing is going to overwhelm
this thing up here,

78
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,240
the denominator grows faster
than the numerator, which

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,540
essentially we're going
to approach zero.

80
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,310
You're going to get smaller
and smaller fractions.

81
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,000
Just remember, 1/10 and then--
let me actually just-- as x

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,700
gets larger and larger
and larger,

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,430
what's going to happen?

84
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,730
Let me just show you
on my calculator.

85
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,920
Let's say x is equal to 10.

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,570
10 divided by 10 squared minus
10, and normally you wouldn't

87
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,090
have to do this.

88
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,010
I just really want to show
you the intuition.

89
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,800
Whoops!

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,050
I'm not trying to graph.

91
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,220
   

92
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,460
Let me exit from here.

93
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:30,400
So if we have 10 over 10 squared
minus 10, once again,

94
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
you normally wouldn't
have to do this.

95
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,430
I just want to show you,
give you the intuition.

96
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,670
Let me put some parentheses
there.

97
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,270
Let me put some parentheses
over here.

98
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,360
So let me insert the parentheses
there and put a

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
parentheses over here.

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,830
You get a small number.

101
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,380
What happens if x gets
even larger?

102
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,960
   

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,110
Let me make, instead of a 10,
let me make it all 100.

104
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,040
Let me make these tens into
hundreds, into 100.

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,850
Insert 100 there,
what do we get?

106
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,470
We get even a smaller number.

107
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,090
And if you try x is equal to
1,000, it's going to be be

108
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,100
even smaller than that.

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,510
That's because this term right
here is growing faster than

110
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,620
every single other term.

111
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,210
That's why our horizontal
asymptote is y is equal to 0.

112
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,610
Now, the last thing we want to
do, we've drawn all of our

113
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,930
asymptotes, is just try
out some points.

114
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,130
So let's draw like a
little table here.

115
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,650
There's our table.

116
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,570
When x is equal to
0, what is y?

117
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,950
x is 0, we have 0 over
all of this.

118
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,200
0 minus 6, 0 over negative
6 is just 0.

119
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,990
When x is equal to-- I don't
know, let's just try when x is

120
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,900
equal to 1, what do we have?

121
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,980
We have 1 over-- I'll
write it here.

122
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,650
1 over 1 squared minus 1.

123
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,410
Now that's just 0, so
we have negative 6.

124
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,910
When x is equal to negative
1, what do we have?

125
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:02,790
When x is equal to negative
1, we have negative 1 over

126
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:08,310
negative 1 squared, which
is 1 minus negative 1.

127
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,350
So that's plus 1-- right, minus
negative 1-- minus 6.

128
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,630
So what is this right here?

129
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,460
This is negative 1, so this is
going to be negative 1 over 2

130
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,400
minus 6 over negative 4.

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,410
This is going to be equal to
1/4, so we're going to get a

132
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,990
positive value.

133
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,870
So we have-- let me draw this--
negative 1, we're at

134
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,130
1/4 right here.

135
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,170
That's about right there.

136
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,490
I'll do it in a darker color.

137
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,630
We had the point 0, 0, and then
at x is equal to 1, we

138
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,600
had negative 1/6.

139
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,240
So you could keep graphing more
and more points, but it

140
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,150
looks like as we approach this
vertical asymptote from the

141
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,210
right, we go to positive
infinity.

142
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,100
   

143
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,060
And that should make sense.

144
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,810
Let's see, if we were to put
in-- we're approaching

145
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,310
negative 2 from the right.

146
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,350
So if you were to put in
negative 1.9999999, this term

147
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,700
is going to be a very small
positive number.

148
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,010
This term's going to be
a negative number.

149
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,640
This term's going to
be negative number.

150
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,970
The negatives cancel out.

151
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,870
You have a very small positive
number in the denominator.

152
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,280
1 over that gives you a
very positive number.

153
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,390
Now, as we approach the other
vertical asymptote from the

154
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,830
left, we're going to
go super-negative.

155
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,375
My gut tells me that because
when I tried x is equal to 1,

156
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,560
I already went to a
negative value.

157
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,530
But you could imagine if
you did 2.99999, right?

158
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,920
Let me draw that a little
bit better.

159
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,580
   

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,590
You get the idea.

161
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,520
If x is equal to 2.999, so we
get really close to the

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,970
asymptote, this is going to be
positive, this is going to be

163
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,250
negative, that's going to be
positive, and this is going to

164
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,510
be a small number.

165
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,210
So you're going to have 1 over
a very small negative number,

166
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,120
which is a very, I guess,
negative number.

167
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,520
It's a negative of 1 over a very
small number, so you're

168
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,370
going to approach negative
infinity.

169
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,810
Now, let's try some point out
here to see what happens.

170
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,630
So what happens when
x is equal to 4?

171
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:31,910
When x is equal to 4, you have
4 over 16 minus 4 minus 6.

172
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,490
What is that?

173
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,360
That's 16 minus 10.

174
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,034
That is 6.

175
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:42,419
So this is equal to 4/6,
which is equal to 2/3.

176
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,390
So the point 4, 2/3 is here,
so one, two, three, four.

177
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,510
2/3, just like that.

178
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,870
So that gives me the sense,
look, I have to approach this

179
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,680
horizontal asymptote as we go
further and further out.

180
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,330
We're going to probably
approach positive

181
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,130
infinity like this.

182
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,250
Let me draw it a little
neater than that.

183
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,250
Like that.

184
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,730
You get the idea.

185
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,540
Then over here, we're going to
get closer and closer to our

186
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,530
horizontal asymptote as
we approach infinity.

187
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,530
This should be a
smoother-looking curve right

188
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,620
around there.

189
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,230
I'm making a mess here.

190
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,170
This should be a
smoother-looking curve.

191
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,550
You get the idea, I think.

192
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,150
Now, let's see what happens when
x is equal to negative 3.

193
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,440
   

194
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,200
So when x is equal to negative
3, we have negative 3 over

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,860
negative 3 squared, which is 9
minus negative 3, so that's

196
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,290
plus 3 minus 6.

197
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,770
So what is this equal to?

198
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:49,380
This is equal to negative 3
over-- this is 12 minus 6 over

199
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,630
6, right, which is equal to
negative 1/2, So negative 3,

200
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,700
negative 1/2.

201
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,120
Negative 1/2 is right there.

202
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,670
So we're going to approach
this asymptote as we get

203
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,570
really negative.

204
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,340
And we're probably going to go
straight down like that as we

205
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,180
approach this vertical asymptote
right there.

206
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,270
And you could try more points
if you don't believe me.

207
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,350
But let us graph it just to
verify it for ourselves.

208
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:36,220
So our equation is x divided by
x squared minus x minus 6.

209
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,420
And let's graph it.

210
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,730
And there you go.

211
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,670
There you go.

212
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,240
All right, looks pretty good.

213
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,220
   

214
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,390
Our asymptote is zero,
we go down.

215
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,850
Vertical asymptote, bam!

216
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,740
Go up there, then we go back
down here, then we go just

217
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,920
like that again.

218
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,550
So once again, this looks just
about exactly what we got.

219
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,250
Obviously, the graphing
calculator, it kind of a

220
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,020
pitters out as you get close
to these values and it does

221
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,600
weird things, but it has
the same general shape.

222
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,010
We could actually close the
range a little bit if we want,

223
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,190
if we want to graph it.

224
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,600
Let's make our x minimum
value, let's make it 5.

225
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,550
And let's take our x maximum
value, let's

226
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,990
make that 5 as well.

227
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,970
We're kind of zooming
in a little bit.

228
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,520
So let's graph it now.

229
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,930
Bam!

230
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,900
bam!

231
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,590
There you go!

232
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,750
It's the same shape as we
graphed right here.

233
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,010
Hopefully, you found
that satisfying.

234
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,333
