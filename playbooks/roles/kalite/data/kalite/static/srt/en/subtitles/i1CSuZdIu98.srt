1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,420
We're on problem 4.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,840
Traditions Clothing Store
is having a sale.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,590
Shirts that were regularly
priced at $20

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,840
are on sale for $17.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,540
What is the percentage of
the decrease in the

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,110
price of the shirts?

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,680
So what is just the decrease
in the price of the shirts?

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,180
Well, they've gone
from $20 to $17.

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,140
So the decrease is $3.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,440
We have a $3 decrease in the
price of the shirts.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,840
So what is the percentage
of decrease?

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,980
Well, we're starting at $20,
and we're decreasing by $3.

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,360
So the percentage of the
decrease-- let me write it in

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,620
a darker color.

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,280
We're starting at $20 and we're
decreasing it by $3, or

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,560
decreasing it by 3/20.

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,100
This is the percent decrease,
or the fraction

19
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,120
decrease right there.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
And this is going to
be equal to what?

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,210
This is the same thing.

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:59,350
We can divide it out.

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,590
You might be able to do
that in your head.

24
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,050
But just in case you
can't, let me just

25
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,110
write it out like this.

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,650
If I divide 20 into 3, 20
does not go into 3.

27
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,700
Or you could say 20 goes
into 3 zero times.

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,800
0 times 20 is zero.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,150
And then I put a decimal
point right there.

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,690
20 goes into 30-- maybe I should
have done this-- let me

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,420
do it over here.

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,060
20 goes into 3 zero times.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,820
0 times 20 is 0.

34
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,230
And then let me put a decimal
point like that.

35
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,390
And then I'll do
3 minus that 0.

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,270
So I'll just say you have
3.0, just like that.

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,640
Maybe I shouldn't even
write the decimal.

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,040
Maybe I'll write
a 30 like that.

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,660
We have the decimal up here.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,310
20 goes into 30 one time.

41
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,740
1 times 20 is 20.

42
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,280
30 minus 20 is 10.

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,360
And then bring down another
0, this 0 right there.

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
And 20 goes into
100 five times.

45
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,400
5 times 20 is 100.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,520
100 minus 100 is 0.

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,720
So 3/20 can be rewritten
as 0.15.

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,800
And another way you could think
about this is 3/20, is

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
the same thing-- if you multiply
the numerator and the

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,960
denominator by 5-- is the
same thing as 15/100.

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,180
Right?

52
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,980
If I multiply the top and the
bottom by 5, which we can

53
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,180
always do, this is the
same thing as 15/100.

54
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,880
So that's the way you could have
done that in your head,

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,960
saying, oh, that's the
same thing as 0.15.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,360
And 0.15 expressed as
a percentage is 15%.

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
So the correct answer is B.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,950
All right.

59
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,050
Problem number 5.

60
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,890
Which number equals 2 to
the minus fourth power?

61
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,290
So this is a little bit of
review of exponents.

62
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:54,760
2 to the minus 4 is the same
thing as 1 over 2 to the

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,500
fourth power.

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,780
That's all a negative
exponent does.

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,630
It means 1 over essentially
the base to

66
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,210
the positive exponent.

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,320
And this is just going to
be 1 over 2 times 2

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,550
times 2 times 2.

69
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,210
And that's what?

70
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,110
2 times 2 is 4, times 2
is 8, times 2 is 16.

71
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,660
So it's equal to 1/16.

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,120
So that is choice C.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,110
Problem 6.

74
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,130
What is 3/4 minus 1/6?

75
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,550
So whenever you add or subtract
fractions, you have

76
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,400
to find a common denominator.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,620
And a good common denominator
is the least common multiple

78
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,480
of these two guys, or the
smallest number that both of

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,600
these denominators go into.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,880
So the smallest number that both
of these denominators go

81
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,440
into is 12, right?

82
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,580
4 goes into 12 three times, and
6 goes into 12 two times.

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,130
So let's rewrite these fractions
with 12 as a

84
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,910
denominator.

85
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,730
So something over 12 minus
something over 12.

86
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,940
So how do we rewrite 3/4
as something over 12?

87
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,520
Well, 4 goes into
12 three times.

88
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,250
Or we could say 3
times 4 is 12.

89
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,670
So 3 times 3 will be the
other numerator.

90
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,550
You get 9/12.

91
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,870
3/4 and 9/12 are the exact
same fraction.

92
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,660
This is in kind of its simplest
form, when you

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,250
reduced the numerator
and denominator

94
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,260
as much as you can.

95
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,680
But this is a completely
equivalent fraction.

96
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,430
To go from there to there, you
just multiply the numerator

97
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,500
and the denominator by 3.

98
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,970
3 times 3 is 9, 3
times 4 is 12.

99
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,260
And the way you can think
about it, 4 goes

100
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,720
into 12 three times.

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,410
So just multiply 3 times
that numerator.

102
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,890
Let's do the same
thing with 1/6.

103
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,540
6 goes into 12 two times.

104
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,490
So to go from there to
there, we have to

105
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,310
multiply the 6 by 2.

106
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,860
So to go from there to whatever
this numerator is, we

107
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,250
have to multiply that
numerator by 2.

108
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,210
So you stick a 2 right there.

109
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,800
And now that we have a common
denominator, this becomes a

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
simple problem to work out.

111
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,550
It is equal to-- we have 9 out
of 12 pieces, minus 2 out of

112
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,890
12 pieces, or whatever
we're talking about.

113
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,990
Or slices of pie.

114
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,240
So that's going to
be equal to 7/12.

115
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,680
And that is choice C.

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,060
Next problem.

117
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,563
Problem 7.

118
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:23,420
   

119
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,830
Do it in blue again.

120
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,360
A salesperson at a clothing
store earns a 2%

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,020
commission on all sales.

122
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,260
How much commission does
the salesperson

123
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,780
earn on a $300 sale?

124
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,630
Well, they earn 2% on that.

125
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,070
Or you could say 0.02
of the sale.

126
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,650
So you could just multiply
300 times 0.02.

127
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,220
This is kind of the
way to just do it.

128
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,090
And I'll maybe give you a little
intuition on how you

129
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,970
could do this in your head if
you're constrained for time.

130
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,600
But the easiest way to think
about it is just

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,590
multiply 2 times 300.

132
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,330
Or 2 times 0 is 0.

133
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,920
2 times 0 is 0, and
2 times 3 is 6.

134
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,960
You could have done
that in your head.

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,290
2 times 300 is 600.

136
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,510
And then you worry about
the decimals.

137
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,290
So we have two spaces behind
the decimal right here.

138
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:13,570
Right?

139
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,160
We have one, two.

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,420
So we're going to have to have
two spaces behind the decimal

141
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,670
in our answer.

142
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,830
   

143
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,870
So the answer right
here is $6.

144
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,490
And that is choice A.

145
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,110
Now, a way you could have done
this in your head, you could

146
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,350
have said, look, he makes
a 2% commission.

147
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,220
So for every $100,
he makes $2.

148
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,700
Right?

149
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,650
2% is the same thing
as 2 out of 100.

150
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,670
So every $100, he makes $2.

151
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:47,030
He sold $300, so that would
also be 3 times

152
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,460
$2 per 100, or $6.

153
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,010
Whatever is easier for you
to understand, that's

154
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,420
what you should do.

155
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,140
Problem number 8.

156
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,420
I'll do this in green.

157
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,740
Some students attend school 180
of the 365 days in a year.

158
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,920
About what part of the year
do they attend school?

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,870
And so the keyword here is
about, which tells me that

160
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,630
they don't want an
exact answer.

161
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,040
They don't want me to sit
there-- I mean, if I wanted

162
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,500
to, they attend 180
out of 365 days.

163
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,650
If I wanted the exact
percentage, I would have to

164
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,590
take 365 and divide it into 180,
with some decimals, and

165
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,970
I'll get some-- I could work
it out, just like I did the

166
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,200
decimal division in the past,
but it would take some time,

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,020
and they just want
to know about.

168
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,550
So what's 180/365 roughly?

169
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,840
Well, what's 180 times 2?

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,190
You could say 180/360, and I
picked 360 because that's 180

171
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,880
times 2, that's equal to 50%.

172
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,930
This is not that different
than this.

173
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,610
We just have a small change
of the denominator, small

174
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,310
relative to how large
that denominator is.

175
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,060
So the answer here is 50%.

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,630
If they had a couple of other
choices here like 49% or 51%,

177
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,960
then you would have to
work this out in a

178
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,310
little bit more detail.

179
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,510
But it's pretty clear
that 180/365 is

180
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,130
pretty close to 50%.

181
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,100
It's nowhere near 18% or 75%,
so you can feel pretty good

182
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,790
about this answer.

183
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,520
If 49% were one of the choices,
then I would have to

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
do a little bit more
arithmetic right

185
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,330
here with the division.

186
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,250
Problem number 9.

187
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,539
What is the value of 2 to the
sixth times 2 to the fourth,

188
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,750
divided by 2 to the fifth?

189
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,360
Now, you could solve each
of these powers.

190
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,580
2 to the sixth is what?

191
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,430
It's 64.

192
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,650
You could work out each of
these exponents, and then

193
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,240
multiply them and then divide,
but it would take you forever.

194
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,830
So what they really want you
to do here is use your

195
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,230
exponent rules.

196
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,460
So when you multiply two
exponents and they have the

197
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,620
same base-- let me write
it this way.

198
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,210
2 to the sixth times 2 to
the fourth, all of that

199
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,740
over 2 to the fifth.

200
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,890
What's that equal to?

201
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,490
So let's just simplify the
numerator first. So I'll keep

202
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,300
the denominator the same.

203
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,610
When you multiply two exponents
with the same base,

204
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,420
you essentially can just
add the exponents.

205
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,920
So the same base is 2.

206
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,270
So this is going to be equal to
2 to the 6 plus 4, or 2 to

207
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,810
the 10th power.

208
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,840
Now, when you divide exponents
that have the same base, you

209
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,060
subtract the exponents.

210
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,290
So this is going to be equal to
2 to the 10 minus 5 power,

211
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,140
which is equal to
2 to the fifth.

212
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,040
And that's our answer.

213
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,620
And we look at our choices, we
don't see 2 to the fifth.

214
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,970
So we're actually going to
have to multiply it out.

215
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,250
And so 2 to the fifth
is 2 times 2 times 2

216
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,880
times 2 times 2.

217
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,670
2 times itself five times.

218
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,560
That's what 2 to the
fifth means.

219
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,140
So what is this?

220
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,780
2 times 2 is 4.

221
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,720
4 times 2 is 8.

222
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,650
8 times 2 is 16.

223
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,830
16 times 2 is 32.

224
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,930
So that is our answer.

225
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,180
D.

226
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,478
