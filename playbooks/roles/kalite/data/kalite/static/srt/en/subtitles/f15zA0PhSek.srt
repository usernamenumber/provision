1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's try to solve a
more involved equation.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:15,190
So, let's say that we have 2x
plus 3, 2x plus 3 is equal

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:23,040
to is equal to 5x minus 2.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,120
So this might look a
little daunting at first.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,220
We have x's on both
sides of the equation.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,980
We're adding and
subtracting numbers.

7
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,527
How do you solve it?

8
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,450
And we'll do it in a couple of different ways.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,550
The important thing to remember is, we just

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,450
want to isolate an x.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,750
Once you've isolated an x,
you have x equals something.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,900
Or x equals something.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,640
You're done, you've
solved the equation.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,050
You can actually go back and
check whether that works, So

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,400
what we're going to do is just
do a bunch of operations on

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,375
both sides of the equation,
to eventually isolate the x.

17
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,590
But while we do those, I
actually want to visualize

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,140
what's occurring.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,670
Because I don't want you just
say, oh what are the rules or

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,240
the steps of solving equations.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,920
And I forgot whether this is a
allowed or that isn't allowed.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,090
If you visualize what's
happening, it'll actually be

23
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,780
common sense what's allowed.

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,880
So let's visualize it.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,890
So we have 2x right here
on the left-hand side.

26
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,430
So that's literally,
that's x plus x.

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,850
And then you have plus 3.

28
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,480
Plus 3, I'll do it like this.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,480
So that's equal to plus
1, plus 1, plus 1.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,910
That's the same thing as 3.

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,260
I could've drawn 3
circles here as well.

32
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,800
Let do the same color.

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,040
Plus 3.

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,670
And then that is
equal to 5 x's.

35
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,200
Do that in blue.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,450
That is equal to 5 x's.

37
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,440
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

38
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,240
And I want to make it clear.

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,110
You would never actually
have to do it this way when

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,140
you're solving the problem.

41
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,440
You would just have to
do the algebraic steps.

42
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,010
But I'm doing this for you so
you can actually visualize

43
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,860
what this equation is saying.

44
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,060
the left-hand side is these
two orange x's plus 3.

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,540
The right-hand side
is 5x minus 2.

46
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,930
So minus 2, we could write
as -- so let me do this

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,890
in a different color,
I'll do it in pink.

48
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,580
So, minus 2, I'll do as
minus 1 and minus 1.

49
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,420
Now, we want to isolate
the x's on the same

50
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,450
side of the equation.

51
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,870
So, how could we do that?

52
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,670
Well, there's two
ways of doing it.

53
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,250
We could subtract these
two x's from both

54
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,450
sides of the equation.

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,720
And that would be
pretty reasonable.

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,220
Because then you'd have
5 x's minus the 2 x's.

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,690
You'd have a positive number of
x's on the right-hand side.

58
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,200
Or, you could actually
subtract 5x from both sides.

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,160
And that's what's
neat about algebra.

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,510
As long as you do legitimate
operations, you will eventually

61
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,890
get the right answer.

62
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,320
So let's just start off
subtracting 2x from both

63
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,690
sides of the equation.

64
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,180
And what I mean there, I mean
we're going to remove 2 x's

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,710
from the left-hand side.

66
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,980
And if we were to move 2 x's on
the left-hand side, we have to

67
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,240
remove 2 x's the
right-hand side.

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,069
Just like that.

69
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,049
So what does that give us

70
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,872
We're subtracting 2 x's.

71
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:50,972
2 x's from the left.

72
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:53,730
And we're also going to
subtract 2 x's from the right.

73
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,290
Now, what does our left-hand
side simplify to?

74
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,460
We have 2x plus 3 minus 2x.

75
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,340
The 2 x's cancel out.

76
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,490
So you're just left with --
you're just left with the 3.

77
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,560
And you see that over here.

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,390
We took 2 of these x's away.

79
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,840
We're just left with the
plus 1, plus 1, plus 1.

80
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:15,238
And then on the right-hand side, 5x minus 2x.

81
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,554
We have it over here.

82
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:17,900
We have 5 x's minus 2 x's.

83
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,590
You only have 1, 2,
3, x's left over.

84
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,860
3 is equal to 3x.

85
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,530
And then you have
your minus 2 there.

86
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,220
You have your minus 2.

87
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,770
So, normally if you were to do
the problem, you would just

88
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,850
have to write what we have
here on the left-hand side.

89
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,860
So what can we do next?

90
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,880
Remember, we want to
isolate the x's.

91
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,560
Well, we have all of our x's on
the right-hand side right here.

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,830
If we could get rid of this
negative 2, off of the

93
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,310
right-hand side, then
the x's will be alone.

94
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,560
They'll be isolated.

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,570
So how can we get rid of
this negative 2, if we

96
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,510
visualize it over here.

97
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,930
This negative 1,
this negative 1.

98
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,295
Well, we could add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

99
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,015
Think about what happens there.

100
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,838
So, if we add 2, so I'm going to do it like this.

101
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,169
Plus 1, plus 1.

102
00:03:59,169 --> 00:03:59,770
So you could literally see.

103
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,990
We're adding 2.

104
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,990
And then we're going to add
2 to the left-hand side.

105
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,320
1 plus, 1 plus.

106
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,590
What happens?

107
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,790
Let me do it over here as well.

108
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,070
So we're going to add 2.

109
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,770
We're going to add 2.

110
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,380
So what happens to
the left-hand side?

111
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,672
3 plus 2 is going
to be equal to 5.

112
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:22,284
And that is going to be equal to 3x minus 2 plus 2.

113
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:23,463
These guys cancel out.

114
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,550
And you're just left with 3x.

115
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,880
And we see it over here.

116
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,390
We have the left-hand side is 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1.

117
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,120
We have 5 1's, or 5.

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,020
And the right-hand side,
we have the 3 x's,

119
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,040
right over there.

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,730
And then we have the
negative 1, negative 1.

121
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,840
Plus 1, plus 1, negative
1, these cancel out.

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,140
They get us to 0.

123
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,060
They cancel out.

124
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,500
So we're just left with
5 is equal to 3x.

125
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,670
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 is equal to 3x.

126
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,550
Let me clear everything that
we've removed, so it looks

127
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,971
a little bit cleaner.

128
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,345
These are all of the things
that we've removed.

129
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,240
Let me clear that out.

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
And then let me clear
that out, like that.

131
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
Edit.

132
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,300
Clear.

133
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,810
So now we are just left
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

134
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,230
Actually, let me
move this over.

135
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:22,542
So I could just move this
over right over here.

136
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,080
We now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

137
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,610
These are the two that we
added here, is equal to 3x.

138
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,750
These guys canceled out.

139
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,360
That's why we have
nothing there.

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,310
Now, to solve this, we
just divide both sides

141
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,950
of this equation by 3.

142
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,170
And this is going to
be a little hard to

143
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,210
visualize over here.

144
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,050
But if we divide over here both
sides by 3, what do we get?

145
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,480
We divide the left by 3.

146
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,810
We divide the right by 3.

147
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,560
The whole reason why we divided
by 3 is because the x was

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,460
being multiplied by 3.

149
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,650
3 is the coefficient on the x.

150
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,630
Fancy word, it literally
just means the number

151
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,360
multiplying the variable.

152
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,110
The number we're solving, the
variable we're solving for.

153
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,140
So these 3's cancel out.

154
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,520
The right-hand side of
the equation is just x.

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,260
The left-hand side is 5/3.

156
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,780
So 5/3, we could say
is is equal to 5/3.

157
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,030
And this is different than
everything we've seen so far.

158
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,790
I now have the x on the
right-hand side, the value

159
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,710
on the left-hand side.

160
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,720
That's completely fine.

161
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,800
This is the exact same thing as
saying 5/3 is is equal to x is

162
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,680
the same thing as saying
x's equal to 5/3.

163
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,280
Completely equivalent.

164
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,080
Completely equivalent.

165
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,140
We sometimes get more used
to this one, but this is

166
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,510
completely the same thing.

167
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,090
Now, if we wanted to write this
as a mixed number, if we want

168
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,760
to write this as a mixed
number, 3 goes into 5 one

169
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,480
time with remainder 2.

170
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,610
So it's going to be 1 2/3.

171
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,680
So it's going to be 1 2/3.

172
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,410
So we could also write
that x is equal to 1 2/3.

173
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,580
And I'll leave it up for you
to actually substitute back

174
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,990
into this original equation.

175
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,650
And see that it works out.

176
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,260
Now, to visualize it over here,
you know, how did he get 1

177
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,390
2/3, let's think about it.

178
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,790
Instead of doing 1, I'm
going to do circles.

179
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,510
I am going to do circles.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,950
Actually, even better,
I'm going to do squares.

181
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,460
So I'm going to have 5 squares
on the left-hand side.

182
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,570
I'll do it in this same
yellow color right here.

183
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:19,560
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

184
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,172
And that is going to be
equal to the 3 x's.

185
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:25,570
x plus x plus x.

186
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,350
Now, we're dividing both
sides of the equation by 3.

187
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,150
We're dividing both sides
of the equation by 3.

188
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,380
Actually, that's where
we did it up here, we

189
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,850
divided both sides by 3.

190
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,870
So how do you do that
right-hand side's pretty

191
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,480
straightforward.

192
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,760
You want to divide these
3 x's into 3 groups.

193
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,040
That's 1, 2, 3 groups.

194
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,700
1, 2, 3.

195
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Now, how do you
divide 5 into 3?

196
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:48,157
And they have to be thought through even groups.

197
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,929
And the answer tells us.

198
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,582
Each group is going
to be 1 2/3.

199
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:53,430
So, 1 2/3.

200
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,960
So it's going to be 2/3
of this, the next one.

201
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,530
And then we're going
to have 1 2/3.

202
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,740
So this is 1/3.

203
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,480
We're going to need another.

204
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,270
Another 1, so this is 1 1/3.

205
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,770
We're going to need 1 more
1/3, so this is going

206
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,870
to be right here.

207
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,390
And then we're left
with 2/3 and 1.

208
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,450
So we've broken it
up into 3 groups.

209
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,250
This right here.

210
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,400
Let me make it clear.

211
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,840
Let me make it clear, this
right here is 1 2/3.

212
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,650
1 2/3.

213
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,420
And then this right
here, this 1/3.

214
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,140
That's another 1/3, so
that's 2/3, and then

215
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,010
that's 1 right there.

216
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,970
So that's 1 2/3.

217
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,480
And then finally this
is 2/3 and this is

218
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,890
1, so this is 1 2/3.

219
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,030
So when you divide both
sides by 3 you get 1 2/3.

220
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,430
Each section, each bucket, is
1 2/3 on the left-hand side.

221
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,080
On the left-hand side, or 5/3.

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,120
And on the right-hand
side we just have an x.

223
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,070
So it still works.

224
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,270
A little bit harder to
visualize with fractions.
