1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:10,243
(piano playing)

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,659
When things move, they tend to hit other things,

3
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,843
and then those things move too.

4
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,943
When I pluck this string, it's shoving back and forth

5
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:20,293
against the air molecules around it, and they push against other air molecules

6
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:22,643
although, they are not literally hitting so much as

7
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:24,044
getting too close for comfort,

8
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:26,409
until they get to be air molecules in our ear, which

9
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,793
push against some stuff in our ear, and that sends signals

10
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:32,759
to our brain to say, "Hey! I am getting pushed around here."

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,944
"Let's experience this as sound!"

12
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:37,326
This string is pretty special because it likes to vibrate in

13
00:00:37,326 --> 00:00:39,528
a certain way and at a certain speed.

14
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:41,460
When you're pushing your little sister on a swing,

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,142
you have to get your timing right.

16
00:00:43,142 --> 00:00:45,042
It take her a certain amount of time to complete a swing

17
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:48,009
and it's the same every time, basically.

18
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,745
If you time your pushes to be the same length of time,

19
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:54,228
then even gentle pushes make her swing higher and higher

20
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:56,178
That's amplification.

21
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,061
If you try to push more frequently, you'll just end up

22
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,010
pushing her when she's swinging backwards

23
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,744
instead of going higher, you'll dampen the vibration.

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,028
It's the same thing with this string.

25
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:09,377
It wants to swing at a certain speed, frequency.

26
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:12,428
If I were to sing that same pitch, the sound waves I'm singing

27
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,460
will push against the string at the right speed to amplify

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,077
the vibrations so that that string vibrates, while the other strings don't.

29
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,483
It's called a sympathy vibration.

30
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:24,134
Here's how our ears work. Firstly we've got this eardrum

31
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,217
that gets pushed around by the sound waves.

32
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,632
And then that pushed against some ear bones that push against

33
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:30,549
the cochlea, which has fluid in it

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,182
and now it's sending waves of fluid instead of waves of air

35
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:36,068
but what follows is the same concept as the swing thing

36
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,150
The fluid goes down this long tunnel, which has a membrane

37
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,048
called the basilar membrane.

38
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:44,098
Now, when we have a viola string, the tighter and stiffer

39
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:47,431
it is, the higher the pitch, which means a faster frequency.

40
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,764
The basilar membrane is stiffer at the beginning of the tunnel

41
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:53,830
and gradually gets looser so that it vibrates at high

42
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,048
frequencies at the beginning of the cochlea and goes through

43
00:01:57,048 --> 00:02:00,181
the whole spectrum down to low notes at the other end

44
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,664
So when this fluid starts getting pushed around at a

45
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,715
certain frequency, such as middle C, there's a certain

46
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:08,264
part of the ear that vibrates in sympathy.

47
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:10,781
The part that's vibrating a lot is gonna push against

48
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,882
another kind of fluid in the other half of the cochlea

49
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,264
and this fluid has hairs in it which get pushed around by the fluid

50
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:18,932
and they're like, "Hey! I'm middle C and I'm getting pushed

51
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,299
around quite a bit!"

52
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:21,914
Also, in humans at least, it's not a straight tube,

53
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:24,282
the cochlea is awesomely spiraled up.

54
00:02:24,282 --> 00:02:26,315
Ok, that's cool, but here's some questions.

55
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,514
You can make the note C on any instrument, and

56
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:31,648
the ear will be like, "Hey, a C!"

57
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:34,481
But that C sounds very different depending on whether

58
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,249
I sing it or play it on viola. Why?

59
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,550
And then there's some technicalities in the mathmatics

60
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,915
of swing pushing. It's not exactly true that pushing

61
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,764
with the same frequency as the swing is swinging

62
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,863
is the only way to get the swing to swing.

63
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,914
You could push on just every other swing,

64
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:52,201
and though the swing wouldn't go quite as high as

65
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,449
if you pushed every time, it would still swing pretty well

66
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,382
In fact, instead of pushing every time or half the time,

67
00:02:57,382 --> 00:03:00,916
you could push once every three swings, or four, and so on

68
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,250
There's a whole series of timings that work, but the

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,366
height of the swing, the amplitude, gets smaller.

70
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,915
So in the cochlea, when one frequency goes in, shouldn't

71
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:12,850
it be that part of it vibrates a lot, but there's another part

72
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,816
that likes to vibrate twice as fast, and the waves push

73
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,050
it every other time and make it vibrate too,

74
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,650
and there's another that likes to vibrate three times

75
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,149
as fast, and four times, and this whole series is

76
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,333
all sending signals to the brain that we somehow

77
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,919
percieve it as a single note?

78
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,670
Would that make sense?

79
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,692
Let's also say we played the frequency that's twice

80
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:34,009
as fast as this one at the same time

81
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,693
It would vibrate places that the first note already vibrated,

82
00:03:37,693 --> 00:03:39,542
though maybe more strongly.

83
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,742
This overlap, you'd think, would make our brains percieve

84
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:45,541
these two different frequencies as being almost the same

85
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,509
even though they are very far away

86
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:50,692
Keep that in mind while we go back to Pythagoras.

87
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:53,509
You probably know him from the whole Pythagorean theorem thing

88
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,293
but he's also famous for doing this:

89
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,058
He took a string that played some note,

90
00:03:57,058 --> 00:04:00,776
let's call it C. Then, since Pythagoras liked simple proportions,

91
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,426
he wanted to see what note the string would play at

92
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:05,392
half the length.

93
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,909
So he played half the length and found that the note was

94
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,239
and octave higher. He thought that was pretty neat

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,709
So then he tried the next simplest ratio and

96
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,542
played a third of the string.

97
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:17,541
If the full length was C, then a third the length

98
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,225
would give the note G, an octave and a fifth above.

99
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,759
The next ratio to try was one-fourth of the string

100
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,242
But we can already figure out what note that would be.

101
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,876
If half the string was C an octave up

102
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:29,859
then half of that would be C another octave up.

103
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:33,294
and half of that would be another octave higher and so on and so forth.

104
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,542
And then one fifth of the string made the note E

105
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,293
but wait, let's play that again...

106
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,542
it's a C major chord

107
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,408
Ok, so what about one-sixth?

108
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,192
We can figure that one out too using ratios

109
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,359
we already know.

110
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,793
One-sixth is the same as half of one-third

111
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,976
And one third was this G, so one-sixth

112
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,960
is the G an octave up.

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,809
Check it out! One-seventh will be a new note

114
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,109
because 7 is prime and Pythagoras found that it was

115
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:59,059
this B-flat.

116
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,042
Then 8 is two x two x two

117
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,942
so an eighth gives us C three octaves up

118
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,109
And a 9 is a third of a third

119
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,159
So we'd go an octave and a fifth above

120
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,075
this octave and a fifth

121
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,759
and the notes get closer and closer

122
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,608
until we have all the notes on the chromatic scale

123
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,109
and they go into semi-tones, etc.

124
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:18,392
But let's make one thing clear.

125
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:20,559
This is not some magical relationship between

126
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:23,355
mathematical ratios and consonant intervals.

127
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,150
It's that these notes sound good to our ears

128
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,484
because our ears hear them together in every

129
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,801
vibration that reaches the cochlea.

130
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:35,135
Every single note has the major chord secretly contained

131
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,500
within it.

132
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,235
So that's why certain intervals sound consonant

133
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,235
and other dissonant, and why tonality is like it is

134
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,547
and why cultures that develop music independently

135
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:46,369
of each other still created similar scales, chords, and tonality

136
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,702
This is called the overtone series, by the way

137
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:51,167
and because of physics, but I don't really know why

138
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,617
A string half the length vibrates twice as fast,

139
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:57,484
which, hey! makes this series the same as that series

140
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,217
If this were A 440, meaning that this is a swing that likes to swing

141
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:04,661
440 times a second, here's A an octave up,

142
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:06,886
twice the frequency, 880

143
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:10,243
and here's E at three times the original frequency, 1320

144
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:13,776
The thing about this series, what with making the string vibrate

145
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,810
with different lengths at different frequencies

146
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,076
is that the string is actually vibrating in all of these

147
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:20,544
different waves even when you don't hold it down

148
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:23,010
and producing all of these frequencies

149
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,938
You don't notice the higher ones usually because

150
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:26,926
the lowest pitch is loudest and subsumes them

151
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,210
but say I were to put my finger in the middle of the string

152
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,092
so that it can't vibrate there, but didn't actually hold the string down there

153
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,093
then this string would be free to vibrate in any way

154
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,044
that doesn't move at that point,

155
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:39,776
while these other frequencies couldn't vibrate

156
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:41,777
and if I were to touch it at the one-third point

157
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,977
you'd expect all the overtones not divisible by three

158
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:46,643
to get dampened, so we'd hear this and all its overtones

159
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:50,092
The cool part is that the string is pushing around

160
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,193
the air at all these different frequencies

161
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,844
and so the air is pushing our ear at all these different frequencies

162
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,159
and then the basilar membrane is vibrating in

163
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,910
sympathy at all these different frequencies

164
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,728
and your ear puts it together and understands

165
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:02,710
it as one sound. It says "Hey, we've got some big

166
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,843
vibrations here and pretty strong ones here

167
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,643
and here and there and there

168
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,710
and that pattern is what a viola makes.

169
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,077
It's the difference in the loudness of the overtones

170
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,243
that gives the same note a different timbre

171
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:16,258
A simple sine wave with a single frequency with

172
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,474
no overtones makes an "oooo" sound, like a flute

173
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:21,878
while reedy, nasal-sounding instruments have more power

174
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:24,010
in the higher overtones

175
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,459
When we make different vowel sounds,

176
00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:27,510
we're using our mouth to shape the overtones

177
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,244
coming from our vocal chords

178
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:32,294
dampening some, while amplifying others

179
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,363
To demonstrate, I recorded myself saying

180
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:38,847
"oooaaaeee" (singing different vowel sounds on the same pitch)

181
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,131
at 440 Hz

182
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,981
Now I'm going to put it through a low pass filter,

183
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:44,863
which lets through the frequencies less than A 441

184
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:47,481
but dampens all the overtones.

185
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,330
Check it out!

186
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,481
(sounds of vowel sounds again, but without higher overtones)

187
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,613
Ok, lets make ourselves an overtone series.

188
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:56,981
I'm going to have Audacity make a sine wave,

189
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:58,113
A 220.

190
00:07:58,113 --> 00:08:00,762
Now I'll make another at twice the frequency, 440,

191
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,446
which is A an octave above

192
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:04,680
Here it is alone.

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,514
If we play the two at once, do you think we'll hear

194
00:08:06,514 --> 00:08:08,637
the two separate pitches, or do you think our brain

195
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,570
will say, "hey, two pure frequencies an octave apart?"

196
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,738
"The higher one must be an overtone of the lower one"

197
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:14,371
"so we're really hearing one note!"

198
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:17,049
Here it is.

199
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,485
Let's add the next overtone.

200
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:20,236
3 time 220 gives us 660.

201
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:22,087
Here they are all at once.

202
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,937
It sounds like a different instrument from the

203
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,189
fundamental sine wave, but the same pitch.

204
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,485
Let's add 880.

205
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:29,801
And now, 1000.

206
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,100
Oh, that sounds wrong. Alright, 880 plus 220 is 1100

207
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,517
That's better.

208
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:37,751
We can keep going and now we have all these happy overtones

209
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,851
Zooming in to see the individual sine waves,

210
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:41,652
I can highlight one little bump here and see

211
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:44,501
how the first overtone perfectly fits two little bumps

212
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,400
and the next has three, then four and so on.

213
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,801
By the way, knowing that the speed of sound is about

214
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:51,850
340 meters per second

215
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,001
and seeing that this wave takes about 0.0009 seconds to play

216
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,334
I can multiply those out to find that the distance

217
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:02,319
between here and here is about 0.3 meters, or one foot

218
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:05,518
So now all these waves are shown at actual length

219
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,883
So C#, 1100, is about a foot long,

220
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,951
and each octave down is about half the frequency,

221
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,451
or twice the length

222
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,684
That means that the lowest C on a piano,

223
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:16,834
which is five octaves lower than this C

224
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,804
has a sound wave one foot times 2^5,

225
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:21,804
or thirty-two feet long!

226
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,789
Ok, now I can play with the timbre of the sound

227
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,439
by playing with how loud the overtones are relative to each other

228
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,355
What your ears are doing right now is pretty complicated

229
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:31,490
All these sound waves get added up together into a single wave

230
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,690
and if I export this file, we can see what it looks like.

231
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,556
or I suppose you could graph it

232
00:09:35,556 --> 00:09:37,856
Anyway, your speakers or headphones have this little diaphram

233
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:40,239
in them that pushes the air to make sound waves

234
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:43,057
To make this shape, it pushed forward fast here,

235
00:09:43,057 --> 00:09:44,472
then does this little wiggly thing

236
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,372
then another big push forward.

237
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:49,306
A speaker, remember, is not pushing air from itself to your ear

238
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,690
It bumps against the air, which bumps against more air

239
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,236
and so on, until some air bumps into your eardrum,

240
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:58,176
which moves in the same way as the diaphragm in the speaker did

241
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,736
and that pushed the little bones

242
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:01,453
that push the cochlea, which pushes the fluid

243
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,203
which, depending on the stiffness of the basilar membrane

244
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,753
at each point, is either going to push the basilar membrane

245
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,969
in such a way that makes it vibrate a lot,

246
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,653
and push the little hairs,

247
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,536
or it pushes with the wrong timing,

248
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,486
just like someone bad at playgrounds.

249
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,565
This sound wave will push in a way that makes

250
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,721
the A 220 part of your ear send off a signal

251
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,522
which is pretty easy to see.

252
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:22,953
Some frequencies get pushed the wrong direction sometime

253
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:26,003
but the pushes in the right direction more than make up for it

254
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:28,754
So now all these different frequencies that we added together

255
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,002
and played are now separated out again.

256
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,454
In the meantime, many other signals are being sent out

257
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,720
from other noise, like the sound of my voice,

258
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,287
and the sound of rain, and traffic,

259
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,104
and noisy neighbors, and the air conditioner and so on

260
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:43,570
But then our brain is like, "Yo! Look at these-I found a pattern!"

261
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,536
"All these frequencies fit together into a series starting

262
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:48,416
at this pitch, so I will think of them as one thing"

263
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,381
"And it is a different thing when these frequencies,

264
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:53,166
which fit the pattern of Vi's voice, and oh boy!

265
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,017
that's a car horn!"

266
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:57,833
Somehow this all works, and we're still pretty far

267
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,150
from developing technology that can listen to lots of sound

268
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,301
and separate it out into things nearly as well

269
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,284
as our ears and brain can.

270
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:07,516
Our brains are so good at finding these patterns

271
00:11:07,516 --> 00:11:09,650
that sometimes it find them when they're not there.

272
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,617
Especially if it's subconsciously looking out for it

273
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,614
and you're in a noisy situation

274
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,736
In fact, if the pattern is mostly there,

275
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:17,668
your brain will fill in the blanks and make you

276
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,634
hear a tone that does not exist.

277
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:21,837
Here I've got A 220 and its overtones

278
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,764
Now I'm going to mute A 220.

279
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,632
That frequency is not playing at all.

280
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,733
But you hear the pitches A 220 below this A 440

281
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:32,101
even though A 440 is the lowest frequency playing.

282
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:35,633
Your brain is like, "Well, we've got all these overtones, so close enough"

283
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:37,816
Let me mute the highest overtones one by one

284
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,816
It changes the timbre but not the pitch

285
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:42,001
until we leave only one left

286
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,703
Somehow removing the higher note, you make the

287
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,835
apparent pitch jump up.

288
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:52,382
And, just for good measure....

289
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,949
but you should try it yourself

290
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,931
So there you have it.

291
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:00,330
These notes, these notes given to us by simple ratios

292
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,396
of strings by the laws of physics

293
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,697
and how frequencies vibrate in sympathy to each other

294
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:07,393
by the mathematics of how sine waves add up

295
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,897
these notes are hidden in every spoken word

296
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,797
tucked away in every song

297
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,347
you can hear them in birdsong, bees buzzing,

298
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:18,046
car horns, crickets, cries of infants...

299
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:21,230
and most of the time you don't even realize they're there.

300
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,431
There is a symphony contained in the screeching of a halting train,

301
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,414
if only we are open to listen to it

302
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,897
Your ears, perfected over hundreds of millions of years,

303
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,914
capture these frequencies in such exquisite detail

304
00:12:33,914 --> 00:12:36,347
that it's a wonder that we can make sense of it all.

305
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:39,980
But we do, breaking out the patterns that mathematics dictate

306
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,313
finding order, finding beauty
