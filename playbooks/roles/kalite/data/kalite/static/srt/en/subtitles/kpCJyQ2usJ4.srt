1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,557
Before we get into the meat of algebra,

2
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:03,895
I want to give you a quote

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:05,879
from one of the greatest minds in human history,

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,591
Galileo Galilei, because I think this quote encapsulates

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:13,907
the true point of algebra and really mathematics in general.

6
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:16,991
He said : Philosophy is written in that great book

7
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,324
which ever lies before our eyes

8
00:00:19,324 --> 00:00:20,958
-- I mean the universe --

9
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,944
but we cannot understand it

10
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:23,444
if we do not first learn the language

11
00:00:23,444 --> 00:00:27,601
and grasp the symbols in which it is written.

12
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,101
This book is written in the mathematical language...

13
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:35,823
without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.

14
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:38,298
So very dramatic but very deep

15
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:38,798
and this really is the point of mathematics

16
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:42,470
and what we'll see as we start

17
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,874
getting deeper and deeper into algebra

18
00:00:44,874 --> 00:00:46,918
is that we're gonna start abstracting things

19
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:48,915
and we're going to start getting to core ideas

20
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,861
that start explaining really how the universe is structured.

21
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,021
Sure these ideas can be applied to things

22
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,923
like economics and finance and physics and chemistry

23
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,933
but at their core they're the same idea.

24
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,368
And so they're more fundamental, more pure,

25
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:05,076
than any one of those applications.

26
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:08,103
And to see what I mean by getting down to the root idea.

27
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:10,580
Let's go with a...I guess we could,

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,357
we started with the very grand philosophy of the universe

29
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,536
as written in mathematics.

30
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:17,863
but let's start with a very concrete simple idea.

31
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:21,067
but we'll keep abstracting and see how the same idea connects

32
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:24,401
across many domains in our universe.

33
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,898
So lets just say we're at the store

34
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:30,024
and we're going to buy something and there is a sale.

35
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:36,200
The sale says that it is 30% off and I'm interested --

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,871
and I don't shop at too fancy stores --

37
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,810
so let's say I'm interested in a pair of pants

38
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,375
and the pair of pants before the sale event is about $20.

39
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,500
That is about how much I spend on my pants.

40
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,625
so I'm interested in a $20 pair of pants but it's even better.

41
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,267
there is a thirty percent off sale on these pants.

42
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:57,702
How would I think about how much I'm going to get off of that $20 ?

43
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,200
And this isn't algebra yet

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,169
this is something that you have probably had exposure to.

45
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,800
You would multiply thirty percent times the twenty dollars.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,974
so you would say your discount --your discount-- is equal to,

47
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:14,115
you could write is as 30% times $20.

48
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:16,533
We'll write twenty dollars in purple.

49
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,200
Or you could write it --if you wanted to write-- this is a decimal

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,200
you could write it as 0.30*20 dollars

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,693
And if you were to do the maths

52
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,821
you would get 6 dollars.

53
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,067
So nothing, nothing new over there.

54
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,354
But what if I wanted to generalize a little bit ?

55
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:35,400
That's the discount on this particular pair of pants,

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
but what if I wanted to know the discount

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,333
on anything in the store ?

58
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,133
Well then I could say, let x be the price

59
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,486
-- let's do it in another color --

60
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:46,221
I'm just gonna make a symbol.

61
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:51,169
Let x be the price of the product I want to buy,

62
00:02:51,169 --> 00:03:00,837
the nondiscount price of the product in the store.

63
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:06,142
So now all of a sudden, we can say our discount,

64
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:15,267
is equal to 30%, 30% times x,

65
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,465
or if we wanted to write it as a decimal,

66
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:19,411
we could write 30% as a decimal.

67
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:25,329
we could write 0.30 times x --times x--.

68
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,351
Now this is interesting.

69
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,841
Now you give me the price of any product in the store

70
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,608
and I can substitute it in for x,

71
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:34,395
and then I can essentially multiply it 0.3 times that

72
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,225
and I would get the discount.

73
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,533
Now we're starting to, very slowly,

74
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,331
starting to get into the abstraction of algebra.

75
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,867
We'll see that they would get much more nuanced and deep

76
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,591
and frankly more beautiful

77
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:52,409
as we start studying more and more algebraic ideas.

78
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,080
But we aren't done here.

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,077
We can abstract this even more.

80
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,643
Over here we've said

81
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:59,067
we've generalized this for any product,

82
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,400
we're not just saying for this 20 dollar product.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,795
If there's a 10 dollar product,

84
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:05,737
we can put that 10 dollar product in here for x,

85
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:07,966
and then we would say 0.30 times 10.

86
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,667
The discount would be 3 dollars.

87
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,795
It might be a $100 product,

88
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,303
then the discount would be 30 dollars.

89
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,071
But let's generalize even more.

90
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:19,576
Let's say : "What is the discount for any given sale,

91
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,133
--when the sale has a certain percentage-- ?"

92
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,919
Now we can say that the discount

93
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,759
--let me define a variable--

94
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,290
Let's let m = ... I'll say p, just so it makes sense,

95
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:41,200
p is equal to the percentage off.

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,667
Now what can we do ?

97
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:47,046
Now we can say that the discount

98
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:50,405
is equal to the percentage off.

99
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,733
In these other examples we were picking 30 percent,

100
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,729
but now we can say it's p, it's the percentage off.

101
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,852
It's p.

102
00:04:56,852 --> 00:05:01,200
That's the percentage off times the product in question,

103
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,262
times the price, the non discount price of the product in question.

104
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,138
Well, that was x.

105
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,667
The discount is equal to p times x.

106
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,364
Now this is really interesting,

107
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:13,268
now we have a general way of calculating a discount

108
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:19,243
for any given percentage off and any given product x.

109
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:22,333
And we didn't have to use these words and these letters.

110
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,402
We could have said "Let y equal the discount"

111
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:28,998
Let y is equal to the discount.

112
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:32,373
then we could have written the same underlying idea

113
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,400
instead of writing discount, we could have written

114
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,200
y is equal to the percentage off p

115
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,067
times the non discount price of the product

116
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,667
--times x.

117
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,779
And you could have defined these letters anyway you wanted.

118
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,513
Instead of writing y there,

119
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:52,267
you could have written a greek letter,

120
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,779
as long as you can keep track of the fact

121
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,729
that the symbol represents the actual dollar discount.

122
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,911
But now things get really interesting,

123
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,215
because we can use this type of a relationship...

124
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:03,741
which is an equation, you're equating

125
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,600
y to this thing right over here,

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,734
that's why we call it an equation.

127
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,406
This can be used for things

128
00:06:09,406 --> 00:06:10,985
that are completely unrelated

129
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:14,231
to the discount price at the store over here.

130
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,810
You might have...

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,431
so in physics you will see

132
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:21,600
that force is equal to mass times acceleration.

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,000
The letters are different

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,933
but these are fundamentally the same idea.

135
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:31,754
We could have let y is equal to force

136
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:36,067
and m is equal to... or mass is equal to p.

137
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:39,200
So let me write p is equal to mass

138
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,333
-- and this wouldn't be an intuitive way to define it --

139
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,646
but I wanna show you that the same idea, the same relationship

140
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:48,323
that's being applied to 2 different things.

141
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,314
And we could say x is equal to acceleration.

142
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:56,961
We could say x is equal to acceleration.

143
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:01,698
Well then the famous "force is equal to mass times acceleration"

144
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:03,795
can be rewritten and it is really the same exact idea

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,533
as y -- which we've defined has force --

146
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:08,964
can be equal to mass

147
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:10,210
-- for which we are going to use the symbol p --

148
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,482
which is equal to p times acceleration.

149
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,579
We are just going to happen to use the letter x here

150
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:17,298
-- times x.

151
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,200
Well this is the exact same equation.

152
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
This is the exact same equation.

153
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
We can see that we can take this equation

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,287
and it can apply to things in economics,

155
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,864
or it can apply to things in finance

156
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:33,019
or it can apply to things in computer science

157
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,123
or logic or electrical engineering

158
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:36,338
or anything -- accounting --

159
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,400
There is an infinite number of applications

160
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
of this one equation.

161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,054
And what's neat about mathematics,

162
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,902
and what's neat about algebra in particular is

163
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:47,087
we can focus on this abstraction.

164
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,975
we can focus on the abstract here,

165
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,185
we can manipulate the abstract here,

166
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:55,462
and what we discover from these ideas, from these manipulations

167
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:58,533
can then go and be reapplied

168
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:02,000
to all of these other applications, to all of them.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,733
And even neater, it's kind of telling us

170
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,063
the true structure of the universe

171
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,718
if you were to strip away all of these human definitions

172
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,429
and all of those human applications.

173
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,729
So for example we can say :

174
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,237
"Look, if y is equal to p times x".

175
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:15,723
So litterally if someone said

176
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:17,267
"Hey, this is y."

177
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,692
and someone says on the other hand "I have p times x."

178
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:22,482
I can say "Well, you have the same thing in both of your hands."

179
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,438
And if your were to divide one of them by a number

180
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,533
and you wanted them to still be equal,

181
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,200
you'd divide the other one by that number.

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,652
So for example,

183
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:34,577
let's say -- we know that y is equal to p times x --

184
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:38,575
what if you want to have them both be equal.

185
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:41,595
What is y divided by x gonna be equal to ?

186
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,467
Well y was equal to p times x

187
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,073
so y divided by x

188
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:48,731
is gonna be the same as p times x divided by x

189
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,321
But now this is interesting,

190
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,544
because p times x divided by x

191
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:53,711
-- well if you multiply by something

192
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,568
and divide by that something

193
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,333
you're gonna get the original number.

194
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,467
If you multiply by 5 and divide by 5,

195
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:01,373
you're just gonna get p,

196
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,867
or whatever this number is.

197
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,333
So those would cancel out.

198
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,333
But we were able to manipulate the abstraction here,

199
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:11,159
and get y over x is equal to p

200
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,380
-- we make that x green --

201
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,324
y over x is equal to p

202
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,667
and now this has implications,

203
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,067
this has implications for every one of these ideas.

204
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,805
One is telling us a fundamental truth about the universe,

205
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,637
almost devoid of any of those applications,

206
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:28,467
but now we can go and take them back

207
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,400
to any place where we applied it.

208
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,100
The really interesting thing is we're gonna find new...

209
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,831
-- there are an infinite number of applications

210
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:36,400
and we don't even know, frankly, most of them.

211
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,386
We're gonna discover new ones for them

212
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,290
in a thousand years.

213
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,785
And so hopefully this gives you a sense

214
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:44,933
for why Galileo said what he said about

215
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:48,133
mathematics is really the language

216
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:51,959
with which we can understand the philosophy of the universe.

217
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,567
That's why people will tell us

218
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,714
that if a completely alien life form would contact humans,

219
00:09:56,714 --> 00:10:00,067
mathematics would probably be our first common ground,

220
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:04,108
the place that we can start to form a basis

221
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:07,108
that we can start to communicate from.
