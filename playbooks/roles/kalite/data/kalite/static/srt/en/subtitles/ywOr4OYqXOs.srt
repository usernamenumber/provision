1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,110
In the last offer-- in the last video,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,110
not the last offering.

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,690
I guess it was a bit of both.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,480
We had completed our Series B.

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,800
We had gone back to the till.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,050
Got another round of venture capital funding.

7
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,698
And we raised 10 million more $ that's going to

8
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:16,653
help us build out the website and do some marketing,

9
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:19,720
and hire up some more engineers and other employees.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,810
And to do that we had to sell one million shares.

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,550
We essentially sold them at $10 a share.

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,475
And so after that offering, well, our pre-money valuation

13
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:35,380
was $30 million and our post-money is now $40 million.

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,910
That's the value of our assets as-- I mean, the website,

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,560
that's kind of an arbitrary valuation.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,880
And I've gotten a letter asking,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,720
how do you value that?

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,460
And that's a whole subject for another playlist.

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,672
And I will do that.

20
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,296
I will do a whole playlist on valuation, eventually.

21
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:53,080
But, to get there, the first thing to understand is

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,301
just the capital structure

23
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,920
and how capital markets work in general.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,160
So that's what we're doing here.

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,469
But anyway, so after you got the $10 million--

26
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:01,800
you had $30 million before, you get $10 million,

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,190
your post-money is $40 million.

28
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,980
And we had to issue a million extra shares to do it.

29
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,760
So before the money we had three million

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,180
and now we have four million shares.

31
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,650
So let me draw what our balance sheet looks like.

32
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,560
So we had $1 million and then we raised $10 million more.

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,210
So if we look at the left-hand side of our balance sheet,

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,764
we have $11 million in cash,

35
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:37,560
and we have our website and intellectual property.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,750
Maybe we have some patents now.

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,000
So you can say assets of the firm.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,890
I guess you could say non-cash assets, right?

39
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,186
That's cash. Non-cash assets.

40
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:52,698
And some of them could be intangibles, like branding.

41
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:55,880
Or maybe we made some small acquisitions of other people.

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,684
And we'll do more videos

43
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,610
on actually the mechanics of acquisitions and all that.

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,597
But you get the idea.

45
00:02:00,597 --> 00:02:02,570
These are all of the other assets of the firm,

46
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,930
whatever they may be.

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,450
And then on the equity side, because we have no liability,

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,880
so in this case assets will be equal to equity.

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,390
On the equity side of the equation

50
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,563
we just have four million shares.

51
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:21,333
1/4 went to the Series B guy,

52
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,635
1/4 went to the Series A guy.

53
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,720
He had bought a million shares,

54
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,340
I think it was at $7.50 a share.

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,120
Then the angel investor had given us a million shares at,

56
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,990
and I think it was $5 a share, that was the angel.

57
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,983
And then there's me and my buddies,

58
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:38,310
we split the last, that first million shares five ways.

59
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,241
And if I wanted to draw my sliver,

60
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:44,990
I still have my 200,000 shares.

61
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,440
And we could keep doing that.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,800
We could get a Series C and a Series D

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,140
that will keep us going.

64
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,326
But let's say that a couple of other people

65
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:56,550
have decided to sell socks on the internet.

66
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,140
And we realize this is becoming a very competitive space.

67
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,850
And we really want to just lay down the gauntlet.

68
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,370
And make sure that ours is the dominant player.

69
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,478
Because we figure that

70
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,218
whoever gets the biggest market share fastest,

71
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:11,540
is going to become the Amazon.com

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,630
and everyone else is going to turn into these me-too players

73
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,021
and they're all going to go out of business.

74
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:19,230
So size has benefits in this situation.

75
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,580
So we don't want to do these piddly $10 million offerings

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,790
and $20 million offerings.

77
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,393
We want to go big time. We say, you know what?

78
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,683
We're going to expand our company huge.

79
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,990
We're going to push marketing hard.

80
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,580
And so we want to raise a lot of money.

81
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,884
Let's say-- let me make up a number--

82
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,311
let's say we want to raise, I don't know,

83
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,950
we want to raise $50 million.

84
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,730
$50 million to invest in the business

85
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,700
and do some hard-core marketing.

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,620
And it happens to be at a time-- let's say it's 1999.

87
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,810
The stock market is racing ahead.

88
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,240
People would love to get in on this kind of stuff.

89
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,080
So we say hey, let's do an initial public offering.

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,640
And then that has two benefits.

91
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,352
One, we will be able to raise a lot of money

92
00:04:04,352 --> 00:04:08,622
for the firm to invest in maybe building distribution centers

93
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,180
or the marketing that I talked about.

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,038
And the other side benefit,

95
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:14,258
which we won't really talk about much at the board meeting,

96
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:16,207
but all of these people right now,

97
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,219
they're all holding these shares, right?

98
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,880
I have these 200,000 shares.

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,019
This angel investor has this million shares.

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,000
And there's really not a lot they can do with them, right?

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,383
Maybe the angel investor,

102
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:30,530
maybe he had an expensive divorce settlement

103
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,960
and he has to make some alimony payments now,

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,350
and he doesn't really have the cash.

105
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,380
He can't do anything with these shares, right?

106
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,560
Same thing with these VCs.

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,740
These VCs are accountable to their investors.

108
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,750
And they can say-- like, this VC can say oh, you know what?

109
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,310
I bought those shares at $7.50 per share,

110
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,174
and then this guy came and bought it at $10 per share,

111
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:50,150
so I already got a 33% gain on my investment.

112
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,067
But the investors aren't that impressed by that,

113
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,910
because you're still holding the shares.

114
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,526
You can't really say they're worth $10

115
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,480
until you actually turned them into $10.

116
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,670
Or you turn them into actual cash.

117
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,470
So, by doing an initial public offering,

118
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,630
all of a sudden all of the players will have liquidity.

119
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,679
Which means they can exchange what they have,

120
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,730
including myself.

121
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,520
So they can exchange what they have for actual cash

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,170
if they need to.

123
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,150
So how does that work?

124
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,296
So I would go to an investment bank,

125
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:21,680
although they've all turned into commercial banks now.

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,080
But we're talking in a pre-2008 world.

127
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,540
I would go to an investment bank and I'd say--

128
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,370
or more likely they would come to me and say hey,

129
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,600
you guys could raise big money in the public markets right now.

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,030
Why don't you do an IPO?

131
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,400
And in a few seconds you'll realize

132
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,540
why they are so keen to do it.

133
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,650
And I say, sure.

134
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,910
We can raise a lot of money.

135
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,820
And also we'll be in the press,

136
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,450
so that'll be free marketing in and of itself.

137
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,900
So I say sure, do all of the work.

138
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,240
So what they'll do, is there will be a lead underwriter.

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,890
Let me write that down, lead underwriter.

140
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,060
And that's essentially the person who does all of the legal work.

141
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,190
They're going to file documents with the SEC

142
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,370
that describe the company.

143
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,216
And they're going to make models and projections and all that.

144
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,181
And then they're also going to have

145
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,260
people riding along them, other banks.

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,310
And they're going to form a syndicate.

147
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,670
A syndicate is just a group of banks that work together

148
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,860
to kind of handle a larger transaction than any one of them

149
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,970
would be willing to handle by themselves.

150
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,230
And it kind of spreads the risk amongst them.

151
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,080
So the bottom line is what the banks do,

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,430
other than doing all the legal work.

153
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,353
They'll value the company

154
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,280
and then they'll go to all of their clients.

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,670
So all of the people who trade through that bank,

156
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,318
all of the institutional clients, all of the hedge funds

157
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,460
that have their prime brokerage accounts at those banks.

158
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,364
And just so you know, a prime brokerage account is

159
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,002
just like a brokerage account,

160
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,510
but it's a brokerage account for big guys.

161
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,740
It's a brokerage account for people managing $100 million

162
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,110
and not their E-Trade account.

163
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,570
That's all a prime brokerage is.

164
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,364
And they'll go to these guys and say hey,

165
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:57,860
we have this hot IPO issue, socks.com.

166
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,745
And we've done our models,

167
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:02,320
and we think this is a $5 billion market.

168
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,986
We think that this company is worth--

169
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,352
we think this company is worth

170
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:10,338
at least $100 million in its current form.

171
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,560
So once again I realize, I mean,

172
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,700
even though we're kind of doing something a little different now,

173
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,130
all of the other things were essentially--

174
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,270
you could call them private offerings.

175
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,950
Or private placements in some way.

176
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,130
Essentially these were private equity sales.

177
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,710
And I know that word is used a lot, private equity.

178
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,570
And that's what venture capital essentially is.

179
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,520
Although normally when people talk about private equity,

180
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,870
they're not talking about venture capital.

181
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,510
And I'll do a whole other video on that.

182
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,086
But venture capital fundamentally is private equity, right?

183
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,145
Because these shares that you're selling,

184
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,208
they're not traded on a public exchange

185
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,648
like the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ,

186
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,412
or something like that.

187
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:44,010
So anyway, back to what we were doing.

188
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,466
These guys, these banks, they go to their clients and say

189
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:50,310
hey, I have this hot new issue.

190
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,260
And they'll kind of gauge sentiment.

191
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,030
They'll talk to clients, they'll talk to each other,

192
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,630
and they say, oh you know what the demand is.

193
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,080
And they'll essentially come up with some price,

194
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,762
which is essentially as high a price as--

195
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:04,496
they want do a high price because obviously as a company,

196
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,510
I want to sell the stock for as much as possible.

197
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,994
But they don't want to do it so high

198
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,250
that the stock doesn't trade up.

199
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,570
Most banks, you want your IPO to look like this.

200
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,690
This is the first day of trading,

201
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,030
this is your IPO price.

202
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,970
They want it to look like that, so that in the future

203
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,960
when there's an IPO, people get excited to get in it.

204
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,703
If this IPO-- if the stock just did this,

205
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:27,510
if it started collapsing,

206
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,070
one, people will lose interest in IPOs in general.

207
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,800
And then people will get suspicious about this company.

208
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,159
And I'll do a whole video on that.

209
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,049
So, how do the mechanics work?

210
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,580
Well, they'll say, hey, you want to raise the $50 million,

211
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,750
well you could do it a couple ways.

212
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:48,800
We say hey, we're willing to issue another

213
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,283
-- let me think of the best way to explain--

214
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:54,740
we're willing to issue another 10 million shares, right?

215
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,040
And I'm not drawing it proportionally.

216
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,030
Let's say we're willing to issue another 10 million shares,

217
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,100
and this should be a lot higher,

218
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,560
because this is four million right here.

219
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,850
We're willing to issue a another 10 million shares,

220
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,760
how much money can we get for it?

221
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,940
And let's see, these bankers talking to essentially the market,

222
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,030
and talking to each other.

223
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,759
They say hey, we think we can justify these guys,

224
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,143
and we're going to do it

225
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,710
for a little bit lower than they're actually worth.

226
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,040
But we think the market will buy

227
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,686
the fact that these guys are worth,

228
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,790
I don't know, let's say they're worth $80 million

229
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,180
in their current incarnation, right?

230
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,840
Which essentially says, before we raise the money,

231
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,800
we have $80 million, we have 4 million shares.

232
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,590
So they're saying $20 a share.

233
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:45,265
So if we go and issue another 10 million shares at $20 a share,

234
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:50,220
we'll actually raise $200 million.

235
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,830
Actually, for the sake of-- so I don't have to edit my math--

236
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,650
let's say that's how much we wanted to raise, $200 million.

237
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,990
So essentially what these guys will do,

238
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,530
our board of directors will issue these new shares.

239
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,160
And then this syndicate of banks, led by the lead underwriter,

240
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,870
will then sell it to their brokerage clients.

241
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,611
To mainly institutional investors,

242
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,400
but it might be some favored rich guys.

243
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,094
If it's not that favored of an IPO,

244
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,880
maybe you might get a call as well.

245
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,100
And they'll sell it to all of them.

246
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,360
And you say, why are they doing that?

247
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,980
Why are they doing all of this work for the company,

248
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,330
helping them raise $200 million?

249
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,170
And they're going to the pain of the legal work,

250
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,910
and they had to put a team of maybe 10 guys on this.

251
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,414
And they had to make models,

252
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,930
and it probably took them maybe 2 or 3 months to do it.

253
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,140
That's a lot of work,

254
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,880
what do they get in exchange for all of this?

255
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,080
Well they actually get a commission.

256
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,903
And that commission, at least historically,

257
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:47,060
has been 7% of the offering.

258
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,640
7% of the offering.

259
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,090
And now you get a sense of why, in a good market,

260
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,321
when you can do these things,

261
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,410
why it has, in history, paid to be an investment banker.

262
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,602
Because 7% of $200 million--and frankly

263
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:03,169
it's not a lot more work to do a $200 million offering

264
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,890
than it is to do a $20 million offering.

265
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,220
It's probably about the same amount.

266
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,030
But 7% of $200 million is $14 million.

267
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,090
So actually these guys aren't going to see $200 million.

268
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,010
They're going to see 200 minus 14 million.

269
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,690
So they're going to see $186 million.

270
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,570
And then these bankers are going to split $14 million.

271
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,200
And that probably is about two months of work

272
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
for maybe ten guys.

273
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,344
So you can imagine--

274
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:36,378
and of course they have the whole bank that has the support,

275
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:38,440
and they have all these-- not anyone could do this.

276
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,910
You have to have what they call retail distribution.

277
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,314
You have to have kind of a channel

278
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:46,617
that you can plug these shares into

279
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,860
to actually get rid of the ten million shares.

280
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,480
You see, it's a fairly profitable business.

281
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,220
So that's what an initial public offering is.

282
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,606
For the first time, a company is selling shares to the public,

283
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:59,290
that is not just to these private investors.

284
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,090
And usually on an initial public offering,

285
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,448
although it's not always the case,

286
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:04,118
these guys aren't selling their shares

287
00:12:04,118 --> 00:12:05,570
as much as they would like to.

288
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,690
They're usually locked in for a certain period,

289
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,770
just because it looks bad if, especially the insiders--

290
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,450
those were the founders of the company-- actually sell their shares.

291
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,750
But six months later, then I can go and sell my shares.

292
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,388
Maybe if I do it on a small amount,

293
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:20,890
I can go and sell it in the NASDAQ.

294
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,590
And I have a publicly traded price, so on any given day,

295
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,650
I know exactly what my shares are worth.

296
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,030
And this is an important thing to realize.

297
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,490
Because a lot of times when people buy a stock,

298
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,110
they're like, oh, I've invested in that company.

299
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,280
Well, kind of.

300
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,000
When you normally buy a stock on an exchange,

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,338
as the New York Stock Exchange,

302
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,240
you're just buying the stock from somebody else.

303
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,940
You're not buying the stock from that company.

304
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,095
So when you pay $100 for an IBM stock

305
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,537
-- I've run out of space.

306
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,579
That's why I'm just talking and not drawing.

307
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,602
Let me erase this.

308
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,500
I've run out of time, too.

309
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,910
But I think this is an important point.

310
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,399
When you buy stock from someone else

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,012
-- so if I give my $100

312
00:12:58,012 --> 00:13:02,822
and I get a stock certificate of IBM,

313
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:06,365
most of the time, if I were to do this today, I'm just-

314
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:10,123
- this is me, with a mustache--

315
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,680
I'm just getting it from some other dude, right?

316
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,970
Well maybe he's happy because he got $100.

317
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,106
He's got a top-hat.

318
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:21,850
And this is what happens in the stock market every day.

319
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,660
So when I buy that, I'm not really investing in IBM.

320
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,226
I'm just buying the money--

321
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,790
I'm just buying that share from another guy.

322
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,960
We're just exchanging shares.

323
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,801
In an IPO, if I'm one of the IPO investors

324
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:39,690
-- this is me -- my $100 in this situation--

325
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,874
Let's see we're dealing with socks.com.

326
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:47,490
Maybe that's its ticker symbol, SOCK.

327
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,370
This time it's actually going to the company.

328
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,970
It's actually going to the-- or the website, in this case.

329
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,362
Of course 7% is being re-directed to the investment bankers.

330
00:13:58,362 --> 00:13:59,817
So when you buying from an IPO,

331
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:01,710
you really are, to some degree, making an investment.

332
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,160
Just like if you were doing a venture capital.

333
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,950
You really are making an investment in a company.

334
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,960
Your money will then be used by the company to hire people

335
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,450
and build factories and make out a website and do marketing.

336
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,610
In this case, you're essentially

337
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,560
just trading shares in a secondary market.

338
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,807
Secondary market just means that

339
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:20,600
it's not going to the actual company.

340
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,057
It's just going to another shareholder

341
00:14:23,057 --> 00:14:25,070
who bought it before you.

342
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,460
Anyway, I've really gone over my time limit.

343
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,956
So I'll see you in the next video.
