99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this video, we're going to show you how to make a bumper switch for your bit-zee bot.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we've got the wires connected to 1 and 3, the power's connected to 1 and 3

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you can see the LED light up there.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then when we switch the power to 1 and 2,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the LED turns off when we push the switch, instead of on.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we want to connect the wires to 1 and 3.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're just gonna double check this with our multimeter.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, when we connect our contacts to 1 and 2, you can see that it turns off when the button is pressed.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then when connected to 1 and 3, it turns on when pressed.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we want to connect to 1 and 3.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can see there's a 1 and 3, really small on the lever switch there.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can buy micro-lever switches like this from Radioshack or a variety of places online.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, now we've got our alligator clips,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're going to bend the wire around the 1 and 3 contacts, so that we can get a good connection.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then we're going to solder those wires in place, to make sure they don't come out.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we'll use the needle-nose pliers to squeeze the wire against the connection there.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I've already put some solder on those connections to make them a little easier to solder to.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There we go; we've got the first wire in place.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the number 3 connection: we're going to just clamp that down, and then we'll go ahead and heat it up, and we've got that soldered in place too.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now those wires are soldered well, and to make sure that the connection is good,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that we have everything soldered correctly, we're going to go ahead and turn on our multimeter and check the ends of the wire.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we'll strip the ends of the wire off there, and use some alligator clips,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll clip to the ends of the leads on our multimeter.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That way we can make sure that, yea, the switch is wired correctly, and it's working.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now we're going to take the outer housing that surrounds the bot off,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're going to try and position the switch, so we're going to drill some holes.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we'll use the holes that are actually in the switch as a guide for our drill.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's important that you make sure that you don't drill into your fingers when you're doing this kind of close work.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you want to keep your fingers away from the drill bit itself.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we've positioned that switch so that it is right off of the edge of the bit-zee bot.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it sticks out over the edge -- you can see right there -- sort of tangent to the circle.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that'll be important when we get the rest of our connector there in place.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we've put the screws in upside-down.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's so that when we put our speaker back in place, the bolts that are protruding won't interfere with that speaker.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, that's why they're sticking up from the underside.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're just tightening those down again with the screwdriver and the needle-nose pliers.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are using 12 gauge solid copper wire, and the reason is that it's pretty stiff,

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it allows us to extend the lever arm for our switch considerably.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So anything that gets in front of our bit-zee bot will be able to trigger its bumper switch.
