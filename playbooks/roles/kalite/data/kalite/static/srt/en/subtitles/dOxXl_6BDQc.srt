1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let ABC be a triangle

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
such that

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle ACB equals pi/6

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is A,B,C

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this angle over here is pi/6

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
assuming it is in radians

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they tell us a,b,c

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
denote the lengths of sides opposite to

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A,B,C RESPECTIVELY

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
values of x for which a equals this thing

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
b equals this thing and c equals this thing

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we need to find a relation between a,b,c

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
once we get the relation,we can substitute

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with these expressions and solve for x

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first i think is how to relate a,b,c with the angle here

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what should pop out into ur brain is law of cosines

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
law of cosines

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that tells us c squared equals

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a squared plus b squared and it is essentially the pythagorean theorem

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but this just is not a right triangle

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 2a*bcosine of

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
c , now in this case

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
angle c right here is angle ACB

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this over here is going to be

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
30 degrees,so what is cosine of 30 degrees

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if just in case u forgot it

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in iit-jee exam all u need in terms of time

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is 30 degrees

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is 1 this is one half,the side opposite to

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
30 degrees,this is 60 degrees,this gonna be a 30,60,90

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is square root of 3 over two,cosine is adjacent

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over hypotenuse,so square root of three over 2 over one

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this in this example it is going to be

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
c squared equal to a squared

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus b squared minus

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2ab and this whole thing is square root of 3 over 2

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times square root of three over 2 and these

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
twos get cancel out,we get c squared equals

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a squared plus b squared minus square root3 into ab

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now the next thing i want to do is that

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
substitute this for a and substitute this for b

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then for c i want to substitute

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this expression right over here,but i have to be careful

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i want to make sure it is in the form something that i can simplify

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i take this x squared plus xplus 1 if i

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if i square this iam going to end in some fourth power and this b iam

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to end up in a 4th power,then in have a business of square root of 3

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let us see,atleast we can
