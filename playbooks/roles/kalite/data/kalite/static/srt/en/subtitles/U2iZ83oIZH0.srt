00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,944
Dr. Steven Zucker: We're in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:10,545
and one of the most astonishing objects they have

4
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,138
--well it's not an object

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,979
Dr. Beth Harris: It's a gate for a city

6
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:16,397
--there were eight double gates that formed

7
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:19,375
part of the walls around the ancient city of Babylon

8
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,762
Dr. Zucker: It's huge

9
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:22,692
Dr. Harris: It doesn't just impress us

10
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,556
it impressed people--but it was built

11
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,875
--in fact it was called one of the Wonders of the World

12
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,210
Dr. Zucker: So Nebuchadnezzar--of biblical fame

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,126
ascended to the throne and proceeded to rebuild

14
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:34,637
the already ancient city of Babylon

15
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:38,362
--this is a city that has its roots in the third millenia B.C.

16
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:41,160
--but it had become a major political center

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,477
under King Hammurabi in the 1700s B.C.E.

18
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,906
--the city had remained populated but regained importance in the 6th century

19
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,830
under Nebuchadnezzar II and under his father

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,640
--and what we are seeing here is part of the enormous building campaign

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,109
that Nebuchadnezzar II had undertaken

22
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,493
Dr. Harris: We may recognize Nebuchadnezzar from the Bible

23
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:03,179
--from the book of Daniel

24
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,673
--he's the ruler of Babylon who conquers and destroys the temple in Jerusalem

25
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:11,262
--and whose responsible for the exile of the Jews

26
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:13,289
Dr. Zucker: Clearly he was very powerful

27
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:15,843
--he was able to undertake this enormous building campaign

28
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,010
--you know he fortified and strengthened

29
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,923
eleven miles of wall around the city of Babylon

30
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,096
--he reconstructed the great ziggurat in Babylon

31
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,057
which had the Temple of Marduk at its top

32
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:30,041
and it's probably the source of the story of the Tower of Bable

33
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:34,680
--he created palaces and he created this extraordinary gate

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,893
Dr. Harris: And hanging gardens which were also considered

35
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:38,729
one of the wonders of the world

36
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,556
--so the city of Babylon had eight double gates

37
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,146
--the one we are looking at is one of those gates

38
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,124
--and actually the smaller of the double gate

39
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:49,915
--the other one would have been even larger

40
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,875
if that's possible to imagine

41
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,523
Dr. Zucker: In fact so large that the museum can't actually put it on display

42
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,746
even in this very large space

43
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:59,432
--this gate which would of course would have only been opened

44
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:02,293
for the friendly--is at the end of a long processional way

45
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:06,696
--lined with beautiful lions that speak very clearly of pride

46
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:09,663
--of power--and of Nebuchadnezzar's rule

47
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,971
Dr. Harris: The lions that we see on processional way

48
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:15,493
represent Ishtar--one of the Babylonians goddesses

49
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:19,357
--the goddess of war and wisdom and sexuality

50
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:21,554
Dr. Zucker: They're raised up to eye-level

51
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:24,323
and they're a little bit smaller than life size

52
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:25,973
but they are pretty big

53
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:27,573
Dr. Harris: And they are frightening

54
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:29,739
--they're mouths are open in these ferocious roars

55
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,736
Dr. Zucker: It's true they are snarling aren't they

56
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:33,687
Dr. Harris: They are--but the fact that they are placed

57
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,092
in this very regular way--makes them seem

58
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:38,628
as though they are trained or controlled

59
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,644
by King Nebuchadnezzar himself

60
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:42,856
Dr. Zucker: It makes us fear not only the lions

61
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:44,908
but it makes us fear the king

62
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:46,889
--the image of a lion is beautiful

63
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:50,024
--this faience of raised to create kind of relief sculpture

64
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:53,074
--so in addition to the lions--there are two other animals forms

65
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,337
that decorate the gate and they're both meant

66
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,458
to be as ferocious as the lions

67
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,889
--a kind of ancient bull known as an auroch

68
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,091
--these were supposed to be terribly fierce

69
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:04,703
--and then alternating with the rows of auroch

70
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:06,973
are a kind of mesopetamian dragon

71
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:09,222
which is really a composite beast

72
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,957
--the front paws are those of lions

73
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,057
--the head and neck come from a snake or serpent

74
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:17,619
--the hind legs come from an eagle perhaps

75
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,202
Dr. Beth Harris: And their tails

76
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:21,126
have a stinger like a scorpion

77
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:23,645
Dr. Zucker: Those dragons are associated with Marduk

78
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:25,688
--the patron god of the city

79
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:28,905
--and Nebuchadnezzar associated himself directly with Marduk

80
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:31,016
--the aurochs--that is these bulls

81
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:33,503
--are associated with the god Adad

82
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,343
--a god associated with storms

83
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:37,136
--with the fertility of the land

84
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:38,624
--with the harvest

85
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,119
--all of these animals speak to protecting the city

86
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,892
--but also providing for the city

87
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,624
Dr. Harris: They are ferocious animals

88
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,674
--but they're also represented in a very regular way

89
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:51,634
along the procession and on the tower and archway of the gate

90
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,902
--so that there is symmetry

91
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,305
--a sense of order in the way they are represented

92
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,725
Dr. Zucker: One of the most extraordinary aspects of these towers

93
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:03,167
--of the gate as a whole--is the color

94
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:06,652
--this is an arid place where the sun is bright--where is gets really hot

95
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:11,138
--and you can imagine how brilliant the blues and greens would have been

96
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:17,101
not in the context of the museum--but in the context of the edge of a desert

97
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,336
--in Mesopotamia there was a real problem

98
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:21,416
--you know the Egyptians were able to build

99
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,772
their Great Pyramids and other monuments

100
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:26,070
out of the native stone that surrounded them

101
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,691
--but in Mesopotamia they didn't have that

102
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:31,492
--this was a river valley--Babylon is on the banks of the Euphrates

103
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:34,109
--in fact the Euphrates cuts right through the city

104
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,568
--when the Mesopotamians wanted to build

105
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,950
they created buildings out of brick

106
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,969
--created from the clay of the river valley

107
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:43,542
--the brilliant blue that we see on the surface of the gate is faience

108
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,299
--this is a technique that was known to the ancient Egyptians

109
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,006
and other parts of the ancient world

110
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,607
--and it uses copper to create this brilliant blue

111
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,839
--and this is a beautiful example

112
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,692
Dr. Harris: So the gate is massive--it's frightening--it's decorative

113
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,935
--and it's brilliantly colored

114
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:03,443
--no wonder Nebuchadnezzar was so proud of it

115
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,391
and wrote an inscription on the side

116
00:05:05,391 --> 00:05:07,605
Dr. Zucker: Let's go read that

117
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:10,592
--now we're sure where the inscription was originally placed on the wall

118
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,919
--but in this reconstruction it's on the left side of the left tower

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,383
--here's an excerpt, "I Nebuchadnezzar laid the foundation of the gates

120
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:22,541
down to the ground water level--and had them built out of pure blue stone

121
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,374
--upon the walls in the inner room of the gate are bulls and dragons

122
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:31,386
--and thus I magnificently adorned them with luxurious splendour for all mankind to behold in awe

123
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:37,990
Dr. Harris: And we are in awe two and a half millenia later

124
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,241
Dr. Zucker: Nebuchadnezzar understood his place in history

125
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:44,717
and he actually wrote inscriptions in his new buildings

126
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:49,325
that not only identified them and identified their purpose and him as their patron

127
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:53,390
--but also asked future rulers to rebuild them for him

128
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,902
Dr. Harris: It's as though he knew that empires come and go

129
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,842
Dr. Zucker: And that he could speak across history

130
00:05:59,842 --> 00:06:03,142
--and in our time--the ruler of Mesopotamia which we now call Iraq

131
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:05,692
seemed to pay attention

132
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:09,809
Saddam Hussein actually had begun the rebuilding of parts of Babylonia

133
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:14,304
--he built his own palace a few hundred meters away from the Ishtar Gate

134
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:17,518
--and began the reconstruction of parts of the city as well

135
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:21,486
--that came to a halt of course in the recent military actions against him

136
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:24,142
--and of course he was ultimately deposed and killed

137
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:27,742
Dr. Harris: And what it meant to rebuild this legendary city

138
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,193
Dr. Zucker: Saddam Hussein was very much rebuilding it

139
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,688
not for Nebuchadnezzar but for his own political ambition

140
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:35,524
Dr. Harris: Reclaiming the power of Nebuchadnezzar for himself

141
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:37,925
Dr. Zucker: That's right and the power of ancient Mesopotamia

142
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:54,388
