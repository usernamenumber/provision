1
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:09,226
>>Minli Virdone: It feels great
to get students engaged.

2
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:11,746
Innately, I believe that
they're already engaged.

3
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,516
And what we're trying
to do is just inspire

4
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:15,576
and really make the
topics really interesting

5
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:26,586
so students get excited
about learning more.

6
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:27,926
>>Karl Wendt: We've got robotics.

7
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:30,476
And there's going to be
trading games and stock market--

8
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:31,666
it's going to be amazing.

9
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,936
Today it starts off fun
and it gets even better.

10
00:00:33,936 --> 00:00:36,966
>>Minli: Welcome, welcome,
to the Discovery Lab.

11
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,356
>>Karl: You guys excited to be here?

12
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:39,396
>>Students: Yeah!

13
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:39,906
>>Karl: All right!

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,996
>>Minli: Well done, well done.

15
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:43,216
So we're really excited
to have you here.

16
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:45,016
>>Minli: At Khan Academy,
we felt that we needed

17
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:48,236
to have our own version of the summer
camp, because we had so many ideas

18
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,416
that we wanted to test out.

19
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,936
What we're really driving
towards is individualized

20
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:55,036
and mastery-based learning.

21
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:58,106
One would think that a Khan Academy
Summer Camp could be be just kids

22
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:00,226
sitting in front of their
computers watching videos.

23
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,206
There are videos, and videos are
extremely important to help students

24
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:04,176
with self-paced learning.

25
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:08,496
But that goes hand-in-hand with
hands-on projects and activities

26
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:13,236
that really drive the intuition,
and really get people excited.

27
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:18,576
The Discovery Lab will include
robotics, computer science,

28
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:22,716
mathematical geometry,
probability and economics.

29
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,076
And even more things
that we'll add in.

30
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:26,716
>>Student: I'll give you a dice.

31
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,786
>>Sal Khan: Based on this, do you
think countries should trade

32
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:30,616
with each other?

33
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:31,236
>>Students: Yes.

34
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:33,446
>>Sal: So why should they
trade with each other?

35
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:36,226
>>Student: Well, maybe we
could trade to prevent wars.

36
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:38,106
>>Sal: Well, you brought out
an interesting point that a lot

37
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:39,896
of people do bring up
between trading countries,

38
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:42,036
that it often makes the
countries more stable.

39
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,556
If we're reliant on your country for
our food, and you're reliant on us

40
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,636
for your oil, we're not likely
to go to war with each other,

41
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,806
because we need each other.

42
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:53,136
You know, it's fascinating,
people do PhDs on this.

43
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:54,836
>>Sal: You can't learn
these things with lectures.

44
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,396
You have to learn -- pretty much
almost everything you have to learn

45
00:01:57,396 --> 00:01:59,926
by doing it, by struggling
with it, I mean,

46
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,026
because that's what
the real world is.

47
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,966
The real world, you just engage,
you jump into an experience.

48
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:06,496
And your brain starts to draw
connections, your brain starts

49
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:09,376
to struggle with it and says,
"Well, hey, how does this work?

50
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:10,536
Can I see any patterns here?

51
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:12,446
Can I make any reason out of it?"

52
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,786
>>Minli: And the other thing
that's really important that's not

53
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,506
content-based, is resilience.

54
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,696
These topics are complex topics.

55
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,206
And students are going to have to
work really hard to be successful,

56
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:24,256
and they just have
to try and try again.

57
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:27,986
The summer camp is one of those
places where we can allow them to try

58
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:31,496
and try again, because we're
not set by a particular date

59
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:33,146
where you have to have
an examination.

60
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:36,166
We'll say, "We'll give
you tools to guide you,

61
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,076
but you have to learn
how to figure this out."

62
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,036
>>Karl: Right now we're going to
assemble a three-dimensional version

63
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,096
of Sierpinski's triangle,
which is a fractal.

64
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,816
>>Karl: It's a chance to take a
two-dimensional construct and go

65
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,896
into three dimensions and give
the students a chance to sort

66
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:54,696
of experience it in a way
that they probably wouldn't

67
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,526
if they were just learning
about it in a textbook.

68
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,336
>>Mohan: In school, I've
heard about this stuff,

69
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,626
I've read about it,
but I never did it.

70
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:05,896
But today, I've been doing it, and
now I can honestly see what it is.

71
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,786
>>Julia: It's more interactive,
and you're doing more stuff.

72
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:10,276
You're not sitting down
with a piece of paper

73
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,156
and a textbook doing math problems.

74
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,686
It's more fun here.

75
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,846
>>Karl: As we get further along,
they'll get a chance to see math

76
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,206
in a different way, because it's
more applied and more hands-on.

77
00:03:18,206 --> 00:03:20,216
>> I call them quadripoints.

78
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,396
>> I'm going to look cool...

79
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:27,456
>>Minli: There's something to be said
about just doing it with your hands,

80
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,356
and taking out the conceptual world,

81
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:33,486
even though it doesn't necessarily
translate into an immediate increase

82
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:35,186
in test scores or anything like that.

83
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:37,856
It does translate into some level 
of excitement in the student.

84
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,396
And that is something that
you don't measure very often,

85
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:44,756
but it's still really important.

86
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:44,866
>>Students: Good!

87
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:50,626
Woo!

88
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:53,316
>>Minli: Discovery Lab, it's a
laboratory not only for the kids,

89
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,046
but it's also for us at Khan
Academy, because what's important

90
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:58,206
for us is not to just
run a summer camp.

91
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,986
What's important is to
understand what it is that works,

92
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:04,346
and if we find activities that work
really well, we can try it again

93
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:06,966
in a different summer camp
or in a different setting.

94
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:10,036
We believe that we can
package this together simply,

95
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:14,956
so that there's a curated set of
projects that are high quality,

96
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:17,726
highly interactive for teachers

97
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,716
to immediately be able
to use in the classroom.

98
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:21,926
>>Sal: This is all
a work in progress.

99
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:25,006
Khan Academy is a work in progress,
the summer camp's a work in progress

100
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:27,146
over the course of this year,
but definitely by next summer.

101
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,186
We're going to have summer
camps that go much deeper.

102
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,486
Summer camp in writing, summer camp
in filmmaking, summer camp in music.

103
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:36,146
We really want to explore the
experiential side of things --

104
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:39,256
not just in traditional STEM
subjects -- really across the board.

105
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:39,896
>>Minli: Great!

106
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,356
Thank you everybody!

107
00:04:41,356 --> 99:59:59,999
Onward!
