1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,720
Let's see if we can extend the
path counting brain teaser to

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,330
three dimensions.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,310
So let's say that I had
a three by three cube.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,280
I'll keep it at three by
three to keep the math

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,905
from getting too hairy.

6
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,320
So let me draw it like that.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,130
I won't use a line tool just
because-- well, maybe I should

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,610
have. So let's see.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,080
The front of the cube looks
something like that.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,910
That's the front of the cube.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,400
And the cube goes backwards
like that.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,570
Comes down.

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,230
Goes like that.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,640
It's a three by three,
like a Rubik's Cube.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,430
I could have drawn this little
bit better, but I think this

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:41,000
will meet our needs.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,430
OK.

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:42,990
There you go.

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,050
Three by three cube.

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,820
And so our goal is to get from
this back left cube.

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,430
This top corner back
left cube.

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,840
And get to this front,
bottom right cube.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,820
So this is our goal.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,690
I'll do it in this yellow.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,640
This is our goal right there.

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,220
And we're allowed to
either go forward.

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,120
From any cube, these are our
three operations or our three

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,590
movements we can do.

29
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,200
We can go forward, or I guess
towards the front.

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,665
We could go down.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,240
Or we can go to the right.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,790
So I can draw it here.

33
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,720
We can go from that
cube to that cube.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,330
So just like the two dimensional
problem, you're

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,200
only allowed to make
forward progress.

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,170
You're not allowed to
come down here, and

37
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,540
then go to over here.

38
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,280
You're allowed to go down here,
then here, but then

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,630
you're not allowed to go up.

40
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,180
So every step you're getting a
little bit closer, from this

41
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,800
back left top cube, to this
front bottom, right cube.

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,790
And so the same question
applies, how many different

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,730
ways are there to get
from there to there?

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,480
And you can pause it now and try
it yourself, because I'm

45
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,540
about to explain how to do it.

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,480
And the first thing, when you
tried to do it yourself, is to

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,410
realize, boy this is
hard to visualize.

48
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,830
Even if I had to draw this
out, I'd have to

49
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,280
go in and then out.

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,180
I mean, how do I even visualize
a three dimensional

51
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,949
cube like this?

52
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,360
And the best way to do is to
separately visualize each of

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,310
the separate layers.

54
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,930
So let's do that.

55
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,550
Let's make this the magenta
layer up here.

56
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,050
We'll call that layer one.

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,340
So this is the magenta
layer up here.

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,540
And you'll see what I'm
doing in a second.

59
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:35,570
This is the mauve layer
right there.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,650
And then finally I'll
do the orange layer.

61
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,060
The orange layer is that
one right there.

62
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,180
What we can do is separately
draw each of these layers.

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,930
So first, let's do the
magenta layer.

64
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,580
So the magenta layer will
look like this.

65
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,610
And now I'll use things that
help-- nope, not like that.

66
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,190
I want to use the other tool.

67
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,270
The magenta layer.

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,974
Let me draw some squares
in here.

69
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:14,670
It's like that, and like that,
and like that, and like that.

70
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,075
And then, the middle one
was the mauve layer.

71
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,740
We'll draw that.

72
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,320
The mauve layer looks
something like that.

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,350
And you can imagine I'm slicing
it, and just looking

74
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,280
at it from above.

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,300
That's the idea here.

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,500
And it's going to help us
visualize this problem.

77
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,850
So the mauve layer looks
something like that.

78
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,350
And then finally the
orange layer.

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,490
Looks like this.

80
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,960
And we're almost ready
to actually

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,210
start doing the problem.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,500
Good enough.

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,430
So just to make sure we
understand our visualization,

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,030
this layer up here-- we
call that layer one.

85
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,400
We could but this as box one.

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,130
This layer is layer two.

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,100
So I'll put a little two here.

88
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,980
And I don't want to get these
confused with the paths and

89
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,920
all that, so I'm writing
it really small.

90
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,065
And this is layer three,
or level three.

91
00:04:14,065 --> 00:04:15,500
And that's right there.

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,130
And just to make sure you
understand, this corner right

93
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,150
there, this is our
start point.

94
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,500
And that's right there.

95
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,770
Right?

96
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,030
Because this is a whole top.

97
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,380
So this is the back
left of the top.

98
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,410
And are finish point, the bottom
right, is right here.

99
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,140
So, essentially, our problem
goes from, how many ways to

100
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,930
get from there to there, to
how many ways to get from

101
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,940
there to there?

102
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,150
So let's just stay
within a layer.

103
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,020
So how many ways can I get
to this point right here?

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,990
Well I can only go from this
point, and go straight in the

105
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,765
layer like that.

106
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,260
So there's only one
way to get there.

107
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,110
That movement is the
exact same movement

108
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,650
as this right here.

109
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,360
Going from this box
to this box.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,330
So there's one way
to get there.

111
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,470
That's the same thing
as there.

112
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,610
And similarly, I
could go there.

113
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,860
And I can just go
one more step.

114
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,360
So there's only one
way to get there.

115
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,230
And that's like going there
and then there.

116
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,580
And by the same logic, I could
go one to the right here.

117
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,160
That's the only way
to get there.

118
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,555
Or I could go two to
the right there.

119
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,820
And that's the only
way to get there.

120
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,900
And now if you watched the two
dimensional path counting

121
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,590
brain teaser, you know that
there's two ways to get here.

122
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,600
And the logic is, well you
could draw it out.

123
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,670
You could go like that.

124
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,780
One, two.

125
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,615
And that's the same thing
as saying, one, two.

126
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,750
Though it's easier to
visualize here.

127
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,060
But the general logic was, well,
to know how many ways to

128
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,520
get to any square, think about
the squares that lead to it,

129
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,090
and how many ways can I get
to those two squares?

130
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,240
And then sum them up.

131
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,810
And by the same logic-- so
there's two ways to get here.

132
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,020
That's that cell.

133
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,720
Three ways to get here, right?

134
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
Two plus one is three.

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,430
One plus two is three.

136
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,770
And three plus three is six.

137
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,930
So there were six ways to
get to this cube right

138
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,610
there, from that one.

139
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,690
So this isn't too different
from the two dimensional

140
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,520
problem so far.

141
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,610
But now it gets interesting.

142
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,245
So how many ways-- I did this
in yellow, but I should have

143
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:06,810
done it in the color
of that layer.

144
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,810
How many ways are there to get
to this cell right here?

145
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,170
This cell is that
one right there.

146
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,660
Well, I start here.

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,490
And I can just go
straight down.

148
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,560
There's only one way
to be there.

149
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,510
But I go straight down.

150
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,170
So there's only one
way to get there.

151
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,030
Actually let's extend.

152
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,740
There's only one way
to get here, if I'm

153
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,050
going straight down.

154
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,190
And so there's only one way
to get to this cell too.

155
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,100
I'd have to go straight
down again.

156
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,910
So there's only one
way to get there.

157
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,650
Hopefully you understand the
way we're visualizing it.

158
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,050
This is the bottom row.

159
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,220
And there's only one way.

160
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,010
You go from here, straight
down to there,

161
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,790
straight down to there.

162
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,710
And that's the only
way to get there.

163
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,750
Fair enough.

164
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,260
Now this is where it
gets interesting.

165
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,700
How many ways are there
to get to this cell?

166
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,460
Well in our old example, there
was only one way in two

167
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,900
dimensions to go
from this cell.

168
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,380
But now we can go from
this cell, and we

169
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,500
could come from above.

170
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,450
And where's above?

171
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,380
Above is right there.

172
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,490
So now we add this cell
to that cell.

173
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,090
So one plus one is, there are
two ways to get there.

174
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,120
How many ways to get to this?

175
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,803
You can't even see it.

176
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:12,760
This is kind of in the back
middle of this cube.

177
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,640
How many ways to get there?

178
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,690
Well, there's two ways to come
from this direction.

179
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,450
And I can also come from
above right there.

180
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,570
So two plus one is three.

181
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,730
How many ways to get here?

182
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,900
Well, one from behind.

183
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,470
And then one from above.

184
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,270
So that's two.

185
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,900
And you see a little
bit of symmetry.

186
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,520
And how many ways
to come here.

187
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,860
Well there's two here.

188
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,360
From going straight forward.

189
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
Two ways to go that way.

190
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,340
And then one way to
come from above.

191
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,650
This is two, and we're
on this cell.

192
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,380
So if we wanted to know how many
ways to get to this cell?

193
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,780
There's two ways to
go from there.

194
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,235
And then one way from above.

195
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,990
So that's three.

196
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,660
And now, right here, how many
ways to get to this cell?

197
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,370
There's three ways.

198
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,360
I could come from here, from
here, or from above.

199
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,870
So I have the two plus
two plus two is six.

200
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,290
Likewise, here, I can come from
six plus three is nine.

201
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,190
But I can also come
from above.

202
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,260
From here.

203
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,620
So there's 12 ways
to get there.

204
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,160
And you can do the same logic.

205
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,020
How many ways to get here?

206
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, within the same row
there are nine ways.

207
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,370
Six plus three is nine.

208
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,170
And then you could come
from above as well.

209
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,710
That's 12.

210
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,230
And finally, how many ways to
get to this cell right here,

211
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,210
which is this one right there?

212
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,260
Well, there's 12 ways
to get here.

213
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,740
So I could go all
of those ways.

214
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,159
12 ways to come from behind
it, so that's 24.

215
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,520
And then six ways to
come from above.

216
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,740
So 12 plus 12 is 24
plus six is 30.

217
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,690
I think you're seeing
the pattern.

218
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,530
So how many ways to get here?

219
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,830
Well it's one plus two,
which is three.

220
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,460
How many ways to get here?

221
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,410
Well it's three plus three,
which is six.

222
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,560
How many ways to get here?

223
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,920
It's one way here, and
two from above.

224
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,370
So it's three.

225
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,940
How many ways to get here?

226
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,010
Well, three from behind
and three from above.

227
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,380
That's six.

228
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,490
Here, it's three plus
three is six.

229
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,970
But you could also
come from above.

230
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,520
So six again.

231
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,670
So that is 12.

232
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,740
How many ways to get here?

233
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,280
12 plus six is 18.

234
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,940
But there's 12 ways to come
from above as well.

235
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,150
So 18 plus 12 is 30.

236
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,550
And by the same logic, there's
18 ways to get here

237
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,380
from these two cells.

238
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,830
But I could also come
from above.

239
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,890
So that is 30.

240
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,900
So how many ways to get
to this last cell?

241
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,040
Well there's 30 from
this direction.

242
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,690
30 ways from there.

243
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,000
30 ways from behind it.

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,820
That's 60.

245
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,810
And then there's another 30
ways to come from above.

246
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,040
So there are 90 ways.

247
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,490
I could write that there,
but you can't see it.

248
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,170
90 ways to get from that
cell over there to

249
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,530
this cell over here.

250
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,560
And then the last video, I
made the analogy to the

251
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,880
binomial theorem.

252
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,060
And I'll leave you to think
about what the three

253
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,240
dimensional analogy is.

254
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,910
And I'll throw out a word
which is never really

255
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,690
mentioned in math class, because
it's normally too

256
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,690
hairy to deal with.

257
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,540
Think about formulating a
trinomial theorem, to help you

258
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,110
multiply things like x plus
y plus z to nth power.

259
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,150
And think about how this cube,
or an extension of it.

260
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,460
This is a three by three
by three cube.

261
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,010
But imagine if it was, you know,
an n by n by n cube.

262
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,160
Then you can start taking things
to arbitrary powers.

263
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,520
So I'll leave you to
think about this.

264
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,250
But I just thought this was a
neat visualization problem,

265
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,870
which is really not any more
difficult than the last one.

266
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,680
Actually, before I leave you
I'll leave you with just a

267
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,560
general principle.

268
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,150
And this is actually really
useful for some standardized

269
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,500
tests, or just logic games.

270
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,125
If I'm trying to get
to this cell.

271
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,160
And let's say there's a bunch
of ways to get here.

272
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,240
And it has to have direction.

273
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,160
So I won't go into a whole
graph theory thing.

274
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,820
But it has to have direction.

275
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,330
And you can't have cycles.

276
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,090
Because then you can have
infinite ways to get to a

277
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,060
certain point.

278
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,020
And let's say that there are
x ways to get there.

279
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,640
Y ways to get there. z
ways to get there.

280
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,660
And a ways to get there.

281
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,880
I'll cycle through
the alphabet.

282
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,560
And this is just a subset
of the larger graph.

283
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,860
This graph could have a
bunch of connections.

284
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,850
This is just where we are.

285
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,950
These are all of the nodes
that connect to this.

286
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,040
The general rule that we've
learned in the last two brain

287
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,530
teasers is, you say, OK, how
can I get to this node?

288
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,700
Well I can go from here,
here, here, or here.

289
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,100
And I just have to add up.

290
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,240
So if I can get from here,
there's x ways to

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
come via this node.

292
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,590
Y ways to come via that note.

293
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,460
z ways to come via that node.

294
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,970
a ways to come via that node.

295
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,780
So the total ways to get
to that node is x plus

296
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,320
y plus z plus a.

297
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,580
And actually, you'll see
problems like this if you ever

298
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,430
plan on becoming a lawyer.

299
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,720
They actually do have problems
like this on the LSAT, that

300
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,790
aren't maybe as complicated
as what we did here.

301
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,610
But you need understand
this principle.

302
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,060
Anyway hope you enjoyed that.

303
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
HEY!

304
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Want to go play roblox?
