1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:05,090
What I want to do in this video is to think about why is so hard for a monopolistic

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:16,154
monopolistic competitor to make money in the long run. And this reminds us monopolistic competitors much closer to perfect competition that is to monopoly.

3
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:19,752
What it means is you have monopoly in your differentiate product,

4
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:27,421
but eventually other people are going to make substitute product so that they can make exactly your product, they won't, can’t reidentical and they might eat it into your mind.

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:34,467
And to understand that let us draw the demand curve for a marketing which,

6
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,088
in which monopolistic competition is going on,

7
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:50,355
I will draw it nice and big, this exercise right over here I’m gonna plot dollars, per dollars, per dollars per unit so prices revenue per unit and we’ll have costs per unit and things like that.

8
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:55,953
And in this exercise we are gonna have quantities produced till the given period of time and we are speaking fairly general term over here.

9
00:00:55,953 --> 00:01:04,287
Now let’s assume, let’s assume that our monopolistic competitors over here is Apple and its ipads.

10
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:12,074
Apple ipads. I wanna, I wanna emphasize I am not making any accusation that Apple is a monopolist here.

11
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:16,689
They just have differentiate products so they are monopolistic competitors here.

12
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:24,745
They have a monopoly in ipad. They don’t have monopoly in tablet computer or in computer in general. But only they can sell ipads.

13
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:30,489
So let’s draw a demand curve in the short run for ipads and I will make leaner to make it simple.

14
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:35,254
I will draw a little better that that so let’s say the demand curve looks something like that.

15
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:43,489
So that is our demand curve, and we know that if that’s demand curve, and remember we are talking about market for ipad,

16
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,990
not the market for all the tablet computers.

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,399
Apple is the monopolist in the market for ipads, so its marginal revenue will have twice the slope of this demand curve.

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,753
So we’ll look something like that, that’s is Apple’s marginal revenue curve.

19
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:05,555
And let us think about the short-run economic profits in the given period of time whatever this quality period of time is.

20
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:11,285
Let’s draw its costs. So first I will draw, let me draw it’s marginal cost.

21
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:17,486
So its marginal cost maybe look something like this. That’s their marginal cost.

22
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:21,087
And then to do average total costs.

23
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:26,284
Up here where you have very low quality, most of your cost are fixed cost, but you divide it by very small quality.

24
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:28,999
So you are going to have a very high average total cost .

25
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:34,683
It’s gonna get lower, lower and lower as long as the cost on each incremental unit is lower that the average.

26
00:02:34,683 --> 00:02:38,021
And the cost on the edging incremental unit marginal cost curve.

27
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:47,740
So as long as the average total cost is higher, then the marginal cost curve, then your, this’s gonna to be a down or sloping.

28
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,293
And at some point, they are gonna to be equal to each other.

29
00:02:50,293 --> 00:03:00,022
And now each incremental unit that you add on it is increasing average because it each incremental unit cost is more than the average so it gonna cost everything to average,

30
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:04,020
it gonna cost everything to average up.

31
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,922
And this actually right over here should be the minimum point on our average total cost curve.

32
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:12,219
So given the way I have drawn things, what is Apple’s short-run economic profits?

33
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,075
Well we just have to think about it

34
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:15,822
quantities to produce

35
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:24,219
so it’s defining a produced one, the marginal revenue much higher than the marginal cost is gonna make the economic profits on that unit is going to keep producing because it continues to be true,

36
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,553
continues to be true all the way to this point, right over here. It doesn’t wanna produce more than that because the cost,

37
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:35,564
the opportunity cost on each incremental unit is higher on the revenue on that.

38
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:39,939
You can take economic lost. So you gonna produce it here.

39
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,272
And that quantity, we call it Q star right over there.

40
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:48,794
And that quantity this is the price they can charge in the market going to the demand curve.

41
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,493
I just went straight up to the demand curve right over here.

42
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:54,397
This is the price they can charge in the market.

43
00:03:54,397 --> 00:04:04,211
And their average, or you can draw that here is the revenue per unit and we have our average cost per unit right over here, and average total cost.

44
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,013
So this is their average economic profit per unit.

45
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:26,090
And if we multiply that, times the total number of unit, if we multiply the total number of units, the area of this rectangle over here is going to give total economic profit, total, economic, economic, economic, profit.

46
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:35,688
Now in all things, if someone, if the rest of the world sees the economic profits, they will say “Wow, that’s good. You know, people are doing better in that market than their opportunity cost.

47
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:40,302
So their other competitors thought: “I can’t produce ipads, but I can start making competitive products. ”

48
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:49,952
So you will see players like Samsung, and we are seeing this, sitting here in 22, and this is a kind of a working progress for these competitors right over here.

49
00:04:49,952 --> 00:05:06,554
Samsung, HTC, HP, all the tablet manufacturers, all the computer manufacturers, they are pairing up with the operating system manufacturers, like Microsoft and Googles, Andriod.

50
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:10,556
They are making competitive products and on the top of it, they are marketing it.

51
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:17,020
They are marketing it heavily. They are marketing. They are trying to market the products as aggressively as possible.

52
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:25,088
So it’s their products to become more and more comperable.to an Ipad Maybe even better than certain inventions either cost or futures and they market heavily.

53
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:28,716
In the long-run what’s going to happen to Apple’s demand curve?

54
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:34,022
Well at any given price, less will be demanded and so demand curve will shift.

55
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,888
The demand curve will shift to the left.

56
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:55,204
So we could end up with the new demand curve, so there is a different shift of blue, that looks something, that looks something , that look something like that, so this is our new demand curve, or maybe we should say the long-run demand curve after these people have made their products better in having marketed heavily.

57
00:05:55,204 --> 00:06:11,978
If that's the new long-run demand curve, then our long-run marginal revenue curve was going to have twice the slope of that, so it's going to look something like this--the twice slope is gonna hit the line, is gonna hit the right about. is going to look, it can do a better job than that.

58
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:15,549
So our new marginal revenue, we did it in slightly different colour.

59
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:20,421
I will do it pink. Our new marginal revenue curve will look something like that.

60
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,802
So this is long-run marginal revenue, long-run marginal revenue curve.

61
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:30,820
So now what is the quantity for Apple to produce?

62
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:38,388
Well now it's gonna make, it's gonna make economic profits, economic profits, economic profits all the way until this point right over here.

63
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:44,630
So now we have this new-- I will call it long-run, long-run quantity. Maybe I will call it.

64
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:56,555
Let me do it in different colour. I'm using that pink too much. Long-run quantity right over there.

65
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,416
And to figure the revenue per unit or the price at that quantity we just go up to the demand curve, our new demand curve.

66
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,080
Remember our long-run demand curve, it's right over there.

67
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,955
It looks like at least the way I've drawn it at the price has change much.

68
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:07,751
We've got the same price. But now what's our economic average profit per unit?

69
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:14,355
Well the way I've drawn it, the average total cost right over there, are right about what that price is.

70
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:19,630
So our average economic profit per unit goes down to zero.

71
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,970
There is, over here we have this nice green high.

72
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:28,061
Now we have no high any more, even though we are selling a good number of unit, our average economic profit per unit is zero.

73
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:33,022
So in set of area over there, we are going to have the area of a line which is actually a zero.

74
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:42,210
So now, we have a zero, zero economic, economic, zero economic profits.

75
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,756
So the important thing to realize from monopolistic competitors-- this one happens overnight, I mean someone of you are arguing here in 22, earlier 22,

76
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,757
Apple is still generating economic profits.

77
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:55,210
It's always important to realize economic profits is different than accounting profits.

78
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,020
Accounting profits can be positive.

79
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,154
Economic profits can be zero when accounting profits is positive.

80
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:07,022
So if you can have a economic loss, then still have accounting profits.

81
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:19,079
But some people would argue right now that Apple's still making profits beyond even their opportunity cost and this is actually a working progress right now in 22 that demand curve was shifting to the left. But eventually.

82
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:26,888
all of the economic profit will be eaten up, and they will be less incentive for all of these players to be as aggressive.

83
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:37,555
So the important thing to realize with the monopolistic competitors is sure their curves look like a monopolist. But the competition doesn't happen in terms of supply of Ipads.

84
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:49,330
None of these players can supply Ipads. The competitive part happen to the all of these people producing substitutes and being aggressive about it and eating into the monopolistic competitors' demand.
