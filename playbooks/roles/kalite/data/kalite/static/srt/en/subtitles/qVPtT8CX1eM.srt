1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,950
We're on problem 129.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,430
If n is a positive integer,

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,790
is the value of b minus a at least-- OK, so let's see.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:16,430
So n is positive. n positive integer. And they're saying,

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,270
is the value of b minus a at least twice the value?

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,700
So that's greater than or equal to twice the value of 3

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,000
to the n minus 2 to the n. That's what we need to test.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Statement 1 tells us, a is equal to 2 to the n plus 1.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,140
And b-- this is still statement 1--

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,030
is equal to 3 to the n plus 1.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,190
So let's think about this a little bit.

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,470
So let's substitute this into this equation.

13
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:07,530
So you get 3 to the n plus 1 minus 2 to the n plus 1 is

14
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,970
greater than or equal to-- and let's multiply this out.

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:17,120
2 times 3 to the n minus 2 times 2 to the n.

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,180
So what's 2 times 2 to the n?

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,790
Well, that's just 2 to the n plus 1.

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,840
2 times 2 to the n is 2 to the n plus 1,

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,050
and there's a minus sign. That's where I got it from.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,970
So interesting. Just like that,

21
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,800
we have a minus 2 to the n plus 1 on both sides.

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,500
So we can just add 2 to the n plus 1 from both sides to

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,000
cancel them out. So we get rid of that, get rid of that.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,520
And then our statement boils down to, is 3 to the n plus 1

25
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,140
greater than or equal to 2 times 3 to the n?

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,050
We could rewrite 3 to the n plus 1 as 3 times 3 to the n.

27
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,690
And we're testing whether that's greater than 2

28
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,070
times 3 to the n.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,440
And they tell us that n is a positive number.

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,390
But that actually doesn't matter.

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,030
Because we have 3 to the n on both sides.

32
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,600
Even if you rose this to a negative exponent,

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,030
you would still have a positive number.

34
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,530
So you could divide both sides by 3 to the n and the

35
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,340
statement boils down to 3 is greater than 2,

36
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,000
which is absolutely correct.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,130
So statement 1 is enough information to say whether

38
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,000
this statement is true or not.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,370
And it actually proves that it's true.

40
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,030
Let's look at statement number two.

41
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,940
Statement number two tells us that n is equal to 3.

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,440
So let's see.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,440
If we look at the original statement, if n is equal to 3,

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,110
then we have to say-- This is what the statement reduces to.

45
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:51,010
It reduces to, b minus a is greater than or equal to 2

46
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,030
times 3 to the third power. So that's 27.

47
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,170
Minus 2 to the third power. Well, 2 to the third is 8.

48
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,730
So it reduces to, b minus a is greater than or equal to-- 27

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,100
minus 8 is 19. Times 2 is 38. Well, I don't know.

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,130
They don't tell us anything else about b, or a, or anything.

51
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,820
So this is a useless statement. And actually,

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,580
going through this was a little bit of a waste of time.

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,300
You could have just said, hey, they told me what n is.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,130
I can come up with a number here, but that still

55
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,630
doesn't give me any information over what b or a is.

56
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,000
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient to answer this question.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,900
And 2 is not.

58
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,070
Let me go to sky blue. Problem 130.

59
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,180
The inflation index for the year 1989,

60
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,820
relative to the year 1970, was 3.56. Indicating that,

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,630
on average, for each dollar spent in 1970 for goods,

62
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,000
3.56 had to be spent for the same goods in 1989.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,360
Let me write that down. 1970, $1.00.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,150
In 1989, that same thing would cost $3.59. Oh, $3.56.

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm getting my 6's and 9's confused. $3.56 had to be spent.

66
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,400
If the price of a model K mixer increased precisely

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,170
according to the inflation index,

68
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,740
what was the price of the mixer in 1970?

69
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,070
So we want to know the mixer K in 1970.

70
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,000
So statement number one. The price of the model K mixer

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,110
was $102.4 more in 1989 than 1970. So let's call this, K.

72
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,700
We're trying to figure out K 70.

73
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,040
That's what we're trying to figure out. Mixer K in 1970.

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,660
So they say the price of the model K mixer was

75
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,580
$102.40 more in 1989 than 1970.

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:02,150
So this, essentially, tells us that mixer K in 1989,

77
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:14,030
minus mixer K in 1970, is equal to $102.40.

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,940
But we also have other information.

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,670
We know that mixer K, it went exactly with inflation,

80
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,000
the increase in inflation price.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,050
So mixer K in 1989, is equal to 3.56 times mixer K in 1970.

82
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,830
Well, how do we know that?

83
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,170
Because they told us that mixer K, the price of it,

84
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,230
increased directly with this inflation.

85
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,190
Pretty much anything that went with inflation was worth 3.56

86
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,000
times more in 1989.

87
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,020
So mixer K in '89 is 3.56 times more than it was in 1970.

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,270
So now, we have this linear equation,

89
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,730
which was given in the problem statement.

90
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,540
And we have this linear equation.

91
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,560
So we have two equations and two unknowns.

92
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,000
So we actually have enough information just with

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,180
statement 1 to solve the problem.

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,430
And I'm actually not even going to go into it because it

95
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,490
would be a waste of time.

96
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,520
Hopefully, we're getting into the rhythm of this.

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Two linear equations, two unknowns, enough information.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,480
If they're quadratic or something, then you'd have to

99
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,020
dig a little bit deeper.

100
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,470
Or if they're somehow parallel equations, but I wouldn't

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,740
worry about that too much on the GMAT. Statement number two.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,100
The price of the model K mixer was $142.40 in 1989.

103
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:40,480
So they're telling us that K in 1989 was 142.40

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,170
Well, this is definitely enough information,

105
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,280
because we already have this equation. The '89 price,

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,010
which is 142.40, is equal to 3.56 times the 1970 price.

107
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,430
So you just divide this by 3.56 and you have your answer.

108
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,790
So each statement, independently,

109
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,710
is enough to solve this problem.

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,700
Problem 131. Is 5 to the k less than a thousand?

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,910
Statement number one tells us that 5 to the k plus 1 is

112
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,650
greater than 3,000.

113
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,150
I already have a sense this isn't going to help us,

114
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,830
because it's essentially setting a lower bound on 5.

115
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,640
So let me just explain it. So 5 to the k plus 1.

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,040
That's the same thing as 5 to the k times 5.

117
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,010
So that's equal to 5 times 5 to the k.

118
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,690
You could view this as 5 to the first power.

119
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,350
Then, you would add the exponents to get here.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And that, they say, is greater than 3,000.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,900
You divide both sides by 5 and you get 5 to the k--

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,000
that's a k-- is greater than 600. That doesn't help us.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,220
5 to the k could be 6,000. Well, 5 to the k could be 700,

124
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,550
in which case this would be true. 5 to the k could be 7,000.

125
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,710
In which case, this wouldn't be true.

126
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,090
So statement 1, by itself, isn't enough information.

127
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,970
Statement number two tells us,

128
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:25,340
5 to the k minus 1 is equal to 5 to the k minus 500.

129
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,690
This is interesting. Let's see what we can do here.

130
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,090
Let's get all the k's on one side.

131
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,020
So this is the same thing as 5 to the k minus 1 minus 5 to

132
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,830
the k is equal to minus 500.

133
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, this is the same thing as 1/5, or 5 to the negative 1.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,020
Let me write that. 5 to the negative 1 times 5 to the k.

135
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Then, minus 5 to the k is equal to minus 500.

136
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,010
Let's factor 5 to the k out of this.

137
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:10,570
So you get 5 to the k times--5 to the negative 1, that's 1/5.

138
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,390
Minus 1-- we factored a 5 to the k out there-- is

139
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,230
equal to minus 500.

140
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,040
And let's see what we can do. 5 to the k. 1/5 minus 1.

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,810
That's minus 4/5,right?Times minus 4/5 is equal to minus 500.

142
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,710
We can get rid of the minus sign on both sides.

143
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,140
Multiply both sides by negative 1.

144
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,870
And then, we can multiply both sides by 5/4.

145
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:43,670
So we get 5 to the k is equal to 500 times what? 5/4.

146
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:57,000
And that is what? That's 125. 2,500 divided by 4.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,760
2,500 divided by 4.I want to say it's 475. Is that-- 5/4. No.

148
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,210
So each fourth is 125 and you have another.

149
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,000
So it's equal to 625.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,030
Even if I just got my math wrong, that doesn't matter.

151
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,400
Because they just want to know whether 5 to the k is less

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,810
than a thousand. And it definitely is.

153
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,150
Even if my math-- 500 times 5/4-- 1/4 of 500 is 125.

154
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:33,200
125 times 5. So we'll have one more of those. 625.

155
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,550
So statement 2, alone, is sufficient to answer the question.

156
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,490
Statement 1 was kind of useless. I've run out of time.

157
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,030
