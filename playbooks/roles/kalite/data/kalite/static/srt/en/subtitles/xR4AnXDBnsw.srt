1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we've got the function f of x is equal

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to x squared, and what I am concerned with is finding

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the area under the curve y is equal to f of x

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's my y-axis, this is my

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my x-axis, they'll let me draw my function

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my function looks like this, at least in the

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first quadrant, that's why I'll graph it for now, I could also graph it on the

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the second quadrant, but what I care about is the area

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
under this curve and above the positive x-axis

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between x equals 1 and x

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
equals 4, and I'm tired of

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
approximating areas, I want to find the exact area under this curve

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
above the x-axis, and the way we didn't know

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the exact area under the curve, this little brown shaded area

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is using the definite integral, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of f(x) dx

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the way, i can conceptualise where this notification comes from

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is we imagine a bunch of infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we sumed up to find this area

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me draw one of these infinite thin rectangles, maybe its not so infinitely thin

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me draw like this

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that would be one of the rectangles, there would be another rectangle

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they should be run descent over Riemann sum, in facts thats where Riemann integer come from

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they know Riemann sum where you have an infinite numbers of these rectangles

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the width of each of these rectangles, this is how I conceptualise it,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the dx, and the height of this rectangles is function of valuated at x

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's within this interval right over here

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this part right over here is the area of one of those rectangles

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're summing them all up, this is kind of elongated S,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
replacement over Sigma for summing, we're summing up

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the infinite number of those infinitely thin rectangles

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the area of those infinitely thin rectangles between 1 and 4

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's what the notation of the definite integral comes from

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we still have undone anything, we just written some notation that says

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the exact area between 1 and 4 under the curve f(x) and above the x axes

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now we'll actually do really productive with this

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have to turn to the second fundamental theorem of calculus

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sometimes called part two of fundamental theorem of calculus

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which tell us that if f(x) has an entire derivative

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if we have an entire derivative of f

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so f(x) is diretive of some function F(x) on other way we can say

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
F(x) is entire derivatived of f(x)

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then I can evaluate this thing, we can do the whole video conceptually understanding why this make sence

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can evaluate this by evaluating the entire derivative of f

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or any entire derivative of f, at four, and from that subtracts the entire derivative valuated at one

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's do it for this particular case right over here

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we're taking, we rewrite this statement instead of x we have x squared

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x squared dx

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well we just gonna figure out what the entire derivative is

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if f(x)=x^2, what is capital F(x) equal to?

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the entire derivative?

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well you might remember from your power rule,

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that if you take the derivative with respect x of x to the third

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're going to get three x squared, which is pretty dare close to x squared

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
except of this factor of 3 so let's divide both sides by three

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's divide both sides by three and

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you get the derivative of x to the third divided by three is indeed x squared

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or you could say that this is the same thing as the derivated with respect of x of x to third over three

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take the derivate of this it'll be

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 times 1/3 and than you'll decrement your power just to be x squared

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this right of here once again is x squared, just equal to x squared

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in this case is the capital F(x), our entire derivative, is x to the third over three

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so we just start to evaluate that at 4 and at 1

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and sometimes, the way, we would for notational use is entire derivative
