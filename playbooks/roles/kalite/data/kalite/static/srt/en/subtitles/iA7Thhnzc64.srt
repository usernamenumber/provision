1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,750
I want to make a quick clarification to the last video and then think about

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,050
what friction up to when the block is actually moving

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,870
In the last video, we started off with a block being stationary

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,080
We knew that the parallel component

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,410
of the force of gravity on that block was 49 N downwards, down the slope

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,270
I went on the block was stationary so there must be an offsetting force

7
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,330
then we said, that's the force of friction and it must be 49 N upwards

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,770
and so they completely net out in that direction

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,700
Now what we said is keep applying a little bit more force until we can budge

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,320
this block to start accelerating downwards

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,120
I said I kept applying a little bit more force until I get to 1 N

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,660
and then the block started to budge

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,710
So at that point, when it started to budge, I am applying this 1 N right over here

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:00,030
There is already 49 N of force or the component of gravity in this direction

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,340
Combined, we're providing 50 N to just start budging it

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,040
to just overcome the force of friction

17
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,130
The one thing I want to clarify here is that

18
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,750
at the whole time the force of friction was not constant at 49 N

19
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,160
When I wasn't messing with this block and the parallel component of force was 49 N

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,610
then the force of friction was 49 N

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,680
When I started to press on it, apply a little bit force

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,050
maybe I applied 1/10 N on top of that

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,520
then the force of friction was 49.1 N

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,630
because it was still providing enough force so that this block was not moving

25
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,790
Then I applied maybe 1/2 N

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,860
and so the total force in the downward direction would have been 49.5 N

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,910
But if it still was not moving

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,870
then the force of friction was still completely overcoming it

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,910
So the force of fiction must be 49.5 N

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,240
All the way up to the combined force in the downward direction being 49.999999 N

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,050
and then the force of friction was still 49.999999 N

32
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,780
All the way until I hit 50 N and the block started to budge

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,810
which tells us that the force of friction, or at least the force of static friction

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,900
all of a sudden now couldn't keep up and it started to accelerate downwards

35
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,340
So in that static scenario, the force of friction

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,370
changed as I applied more or less force in this downward direction

37
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,400
With that out of the way, let's take a different scenario

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
Let me just redraw that same block

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,890
since all this is getting messy

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,720
So we have the same block

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,040
As we said in the last video, we're now assuming wood on wood

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,380
So this is the wedge

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,940
This is the block right over here

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:53,680
We know that the component of gravity that is parallel to the plane right there is 49 N

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,310
We know the component of gravity that's perpendicular to the plane--

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,520
we figured it out about 2 videos ago--

47
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,160
is 49 square root of 3 N

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,760
We know that this block is not accelerating in this normal direction

49
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,500
So there must be some force counteracting gravity in that direction

50
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,110
And that's the normal force of the wedge on the block

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,090
So that is going in that direction

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,830
at 49 square root of 3 N

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,320
And now instead of assuming that this block is stationary

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,910
let's assume that it's moving with a constant velocity

55
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:39,000
So now are dealing with a scenario where the block has a constant velocity

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,180
And for the sake of this video, we assume that constant velocity is downwards

57
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:59,390
The constant velocity v is equal to--let's say--5 m/s down the wedge or down the ramp

58
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,540
or in the direction that is parallel to the surface of the ramp, in this direction

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,920
right over here. So that's the constant velocity

60
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,830
So what are all the forces at play?

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,140
And be very careful here

62
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,550
There might be temptation to say, OK, you know there's a net force here. We're moving

63
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,020
So maybe that's the net force causing the movement, but member, this is super important

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,430
This is Newton's 1st law

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,800
If you have a net force, if you have an unbalanced force, it'll cause it to accelerate

66
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,190
And we are not accelerating here; we have a constant velocity

67
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,580
We are not accelerating here

68
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,660
So if you're not accelerating in that direction

69
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,730
then that means that the force in that direction must be balanced

70
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:50,740
So there must be some force acting in the exactly opposite direction

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,250
that keeps this thing from accelerating downwards

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,770
And so it must be exactly 49 N in the opposite direction

73
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,370
And as you can imagine, this is the force of friction

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,600
This right over here is the force of friction

75
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,170
And the difference between this video and the last video is last time friction was static

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,950
even at 49 N, the box was stationary

77
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,050
You keep nudging it until you get to 50 N, then it start moving

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,700
Here we're just jumping into this picture where

79
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,480
we just see a box that's moving down the slope at 5 m/s

80
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,800
So we don't know how much force it took to overcome static friction

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,030
But we do know

82
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,910
that there is some force of friction that is keeping this box from accelerating

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,280
keeping it at a constant velocity

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,590
that is completely negating the parallel component of the force of gravity

85
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,660
parallel to the surface of this plane

86
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,430
So given this, let's calculate another coefficient of friction

87
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,000
but this is going to be the coefficient of kinetic friction

88
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,390
because now we're moving down the block. I'll do a video on why

89
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,390
sometimes a coefficient of static friction can be different

90
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,590
than the coefficient of kinetic friction

91
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:05,500
So the coefficient of kinetic friction, we'll write it as the Greek letter mu

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,150
with a little k here for kinetic where it's a kind of moving friction

93
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:20,510
It's going to be equal to the magnitude of the force of friction

94
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:30,210
over the magnitude of the normal force

95
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,380
And you can derive this experimentally

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,670
You just observe this whole thing going on and you do the math with this block

97
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,840
You knew the a component of gravity that's going in this direction

98
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,080
you could figure out this coefficient of kinetic friction

99
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,870
What's cool about this is, this is in general going to be true

100
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,270
For any two materials that are like this. So you know, maybe this is

101
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,590
a certain type of wood on a certain type of wood

102
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,940
or a certain type of sandpaper on a certain type of sandpaper

103
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,840
whatever you're talking about, and then you can use that to make predictions

104
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,000
if the incline was different or the mass was different

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,630
or even if you are on a different planet

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,130
or someone was pressing down on this block would change the normal force

107
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,280
So given this right here, let's figure out for the sake of doing it

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,570
the coefficient of kinetic friction here

109
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,590
The force of friction here completely offsetting the force of gravity parallel to the surface

110
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,890
is 49 N

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,710
And the normal force here, the force of contact between these two things

112
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,670
this block and this wedge, is 49 sqrt of 3 N

113
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,470
So we get one over the square root of 3

114
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,280
Let's get the calculator out to get the accurate number here

115
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,300
So we have one divided by the square root of three

116
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,480
which gives us .58

117
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,350
0.58 and there's no units here, because the units cancel out. It's a unitless measurement

118
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,600
And the interesting thing here is that the coefficient the way I've set up this problem

119
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,120
the coefficient of kinetic friction is lower, if we assume the same materials

120
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,280
than the coefficient of static friction

121
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,230
And for some materials, they might not be that different

122
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:20,250
but for other materials, the kinetic friction can be lower than static friction

123
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,310
You never see a situation where the coefficient of static friction is lower than

124
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,010
the coefficient of kinetic friction

125
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,490
but you do see situations where the coefficient of kinetic friction is lower

126
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,670
than the coefficient of static friction that

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,130
once something is moving for some reason--

128
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,040
we'll theorize why that might be--for some reason

129
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,900
friction has a little less potent than when something is stationary

130
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,420
So we can say this generally

131
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:55,870
coefficient of kinetic friction is less than or equal to the coefficient of static friction

132
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,690
It's a little bit easier, or friction provides a little less, or less than

133
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,510
or equal to the force when something's moving than when something is stationary

134
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,320
I'll think about that a little bit deeper in the next video
