1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
Sal: We now know all
about strong acids.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:08,700
For example, hydrochloric acid
in an aqueous solution.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,500
It's strong because it
disassociate completely into

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,920
hydrogen ions or hydronium
molecules, depending on how

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,590
you want to view it.

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,890
And chloride anions.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:25,410
And it's an acid in the
Arrhenius definition, because

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,326
once again, this is an
aqueous solution.

10
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:32,159
In the Arrhenius definition
because it is increasing the

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,590
hydrogen concentration
in the water.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,490
It's an acid in the
Bronsted-Lowry definition

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,950
because this thing is donating
these hydrogen protons.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,810
And it's a Lewis acid because
you can kind of view it as

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,480
hydrochloric acid.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,180
By giving away this, it's taking
these-- the chloride,

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,970
as you can kind of say,
it's taking the

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,190
electrons for itself.

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,740
So it's an electron acceptor.

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,100
So that's another reason
why it's a Lewis acid.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,190
But in every case, it completely
disassociates.

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,150
So it's a strong acid.

23
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,980
Now, by implication, when I call
this a strong acid, that

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,600
must mean that there must be
things called weak acids.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,940
   

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,170
And you could probably
guess what they do.

27
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,850
They don't disassociate
completely.

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:27,620
So let's say you have
hydrofluoric acid in an

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,380
aqueous solution.

30
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,370
It does disassociate somewhat,
so you are going to have some

31
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,320
hydrogen break-off of the
fluorine molecules.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,360
So a hydrogen ion, and
that's of course

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,740
in an aqueous solution.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,830
I was doing aqueous in blue.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,315
And then that's going to
disassociate with the

36
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:56,170
fluoride, the fluorine cation.

37
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,780
But this is a weak
acid, so it's

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,490
not just in one direction.

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,210
It actually goes in both.

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,070
This is an equilibrium
reaction.

41
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,280
We know all about these now.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,670
Which means that some of this
goes in that direction, some

43
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,740
of that goes in that direction,
and both of these

44
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,720
species exist in the molecule.

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,010
And just as aside, you might
wonder hey, aren't fluorine

46
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,690
and chlorine-- they're
both halogens.

47
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,940
Why is this a weak acid while
this is a strong one?

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
And this is just an aside.

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,220
This is something I always
used to wonder about.

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,030
   

51
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,160
So in general, hydrogen
likes to form bonds.

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,390
Remember, alkali metals
we included

53
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,850
everything below hydrogen.

54
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,180
Right?

55
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,540
We included all of these guys.

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,470
All of these guys, they have
this 1 extra electron and

57
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,470
they're on a valence shell, so
they just want to give it up.

58
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,310
And they tend to be very
willing to give

59
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,320
it up to these guys.

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,500
So if you have any of these
period 2 and below with a

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,600
halogen, you normally form
this ionic salt.

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,730
Where this guy gives away an
electron, and one of these

63
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,110
guys takes it, and you have
an ionic compound.

64
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,540
Hydrogen's a little different.

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,630
Hydrogen does have exactly
1 electron in

66
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,270
it's outermost shell.

67
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,780
It just has one shell.

68
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,820
But the first shell is
interesting because it's

69
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,110
complete when it only
has 2 electrons.

70
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,340
These guys wouldn't
have been happy.

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,490
If you gave 1 electron
to these guys-- they

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,060
need to get to eight.

73
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,800
So they're not happy.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,790
But if you give 1 electron
to hydrogen,

75
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,590
hydrogen is pretty happy.

76
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,580
So when hydrogen forms bonds
with these guys here, it

77
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,140
doesn't just completely
give up the electron.

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:35,630
When hydrogen forms bonds with
our halogens over here, it

79
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,620
doesn't completely give
up the electron.

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,250
Because hydrogen says hey, if
you give me some of the

81
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,450
electron, then I get to 2.

82
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,540
And then if you share the
electron, you get to 8.

83
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,510
So it does definitely like the
bond with these guys, but

84
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,250
doesn't give it completely up.

85
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,280
Now.

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,440
Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic
acid, and hydroiodic-- I think

87
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,100
I think I'm seeing it right--
these are all strong acids.

88
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,620
When hydrogen bonds with
any of these guys.

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,690
Which means it disassociates
completely in water.

90
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,310
But when hydrogen bonds with
flourine, it doesn't

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,440
disassociate completely
in water.

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,670
And the reason why is flourine
is even more electronegative.

93
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,770
So this bond between hydrogen
and fluorine-- so if you

94
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:22,790
compare hydrogen fluorine or
hydrofluoric acid to hydrogen

95
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,410
chloride, hydrogen fluoride to
hydrogen chloride, this bond

96
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,660
is much stronger.

97
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,440
Not much stronger.

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,620
I mean, you can measure in the
energy of the bond, and we'll

99
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,270
do that eventually.

100
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,970
But this is a stronger bond
than this right here.

101
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,650
And hydrobromic is
even weaker.

102
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,280
Let me draw it.

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,660
So this one is a little bit
weaker than that one and then

104
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,980
hydrobromic-- I'll draw it
as one line right there.

105
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,350
It's like that.

106
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,850
So these are easier to break, so
when you put this in water,

107
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,700
hydrogen sees these water
molecules that have these

108
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,280
extra electron pairs
floating around.

109
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,290
And and it hogged electrons
from here.

110
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,220
So there's a partial negative
charge, it's tempting for it

111
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,930
to disassociate with the
water molecules.

112
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,630
Well, in this case, yeah, it's
tempting, but it still like to

113
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,480
be hanging around.

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,410
Oxygen is very

115
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,640
electronegative, but so is fluorine.

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,170
So it likes to hang
around with both.

117
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,530
So it kind of doesn't completely
disassociate.

118
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,240
So that's why this one is a
hydrofluoric acid, is a weak

119
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,220
acid, while all of the other
halogenic acids are strong.

120
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,500
Well, with that said, the point
of this isn't to just

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,720
look at the periodic table.

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,630
Let's figure out what the pH is
when I dissolve-- let's say

123
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:50,460
I have 1.5 molar of
hydrofluoric acid.

124
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,740
And obviously, by definition,
since I've given this as

125
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,605
molarity, I have it
in some solutions.

126
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,320
In this case, I have it in
an aqueous solution.

127
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,760
Now.

128
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,790
You could look it up.

129
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,950
Well actually, I'll
just write it.

130
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,285
So every equilibrium reaction
has some equilibrium constant.

131
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,380
So the equilibrium constant for
this reaction-- I'll do it

132
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,080
in green-- and since this is an
acidic reaction, we'll say

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,960
it's the equilibrium constant,
or an acid constant, however

134
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,230
you want to say it, for
hydrogen fluorine.

135
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,800
Hydrofluoric acid.

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,395
Hydrofluoric acid is equal
to the products.

137
00:06:27,395 --> 00:06:34,140
So it's the concentration of
your hydrogen ions times your

138
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,650
concentration of your fluorine
ions divided by your

139
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,230
concentration of your hydrogen
fluoride, or

140
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,380
hydrofluoric acid.

141
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,630
So HFl.

142
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,020
   

143
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,700
And if you look this up at 25
degrees Celsius at roughly

144
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,280
room temperature-- I believe
that is, but let's say it is--

145
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,250
you get a constant value here of
7 times 10 to the minus 4.

146
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,210
So if I have 1.5 molar of
hydrofluoric acid, can I

147
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,720
figure out what the pH is?

148
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,390
Remember, esssentially, I want
to solve for this right here.

149
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,370
If I solve for this, then
I know the hydrogen

150
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,110
concentration.

151
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,490
And then if I take the negative
log of that, then I

152
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,130
know its pH.

153
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,400
So let's see if we
can do that.

154
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,990
So.

155
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,990
I'm throwing 1.5 molar
onto this side of

156
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,880
the equation, right?

157
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,440
But some of it's going to go
and form that stuff, right?

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,180
So let's say x molar
gets disassociated.

159
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,440
So on this side-- let me
see if I can do this.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,250
So I'm throwing 1.5 molar
on this side.

161
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,290
Let's say x molar goes
to that side, right?

162
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,910
And so let's say I have 1.5
molar on this side.

163
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,460
Once I'm in equilibrium,
x goes to

164
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,640
that side of the equation.

165
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,700
Or x reacts to form this
stuff, right here.

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,230
Disassociates.

167
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,700
So once I'm in equilibrium, I'll
have my concentration of

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,860
hydrogen fluoride will
be 1.5 molar minus x.

169
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,610
And what's my concentration
of hydrogen?

170
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,990
Well, if x molar, or x moles of
this, the way you can view,

171
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,405
disassociate, then we have x
moles or x molar of that.

172
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,590
And we'll also have
x molar of that.

173
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,390
Right?

174
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,610
If one of the disassociates,
then you get one of that and

175
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,540
one of that.

176
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,250
So these will be the equilibrium
concentrations.

177
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,559
And I think you can smell some
algebra coming our way.

178
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,840
So these are the equilibrium
concentrations.

179
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,809
Let's see if we can
solve for x.

180
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,360
So we know what the equilibrium
constant is.

181
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,520
It's 7 times 10 to
the minus fourth.

182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,860
We know that the final
equilibrium concentration of

183
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,710
our hydrofluoric acid is the
original 1.5 molar we put in,

184
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,130
minus whatever disassociates
into the stuff up here.

185
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,550
And since x disassociated this
stuff here, I have x molar of

186
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,900
hydrogen, and I have
molar of fluoride.

187
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,400
This is just pure algebra now.

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,440
Let's see if we can
solve this.

189
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,260
So this is equal to--
I'm going to

190
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,090
need space to do this.

191
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,350
So we get 7 times 10
to the minus 4.

192
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,510
Let's multiply both sides
times 1.5 minus x.

193
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,310
Times 1.5 minus x.

194
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,850
Is equal to

195
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,450
x times x, is equal
to x squared.

196
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,290
And then if we multiply-- 7
times 10 to the minus fourth

197
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,330
times-- 7 times 1.5,
that's 10.5, right?

198
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,230
So we have 10.5 times 10
to the minus fourth.

199
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,700
That's that times that.

200
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,950
Minus 7 times 10 to
the minus fourth x

201
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,420
is equal to x squared.

202
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,740
This looks complicated, but
it's just a quadratic

203
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,240
equation, and there's
many videos on that.

204
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
So let's just throw all of
this stuff onto to the

205
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,850
right-hand side because
I like having a

206
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,530
positive coefficient here.

207
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,290
So if I subtract this from both
sides and add this to

208
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:21,590
both sides, I get 0 is equal
to x squared, plus this, so

209
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,010
plus 7 times 10 to the minus
fourth x, right?

210
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,370
I just add this to both sides,
so it shows up on this side of

211
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,120
the equation, which
is right here.

212
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,740
Minus this.

213
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,370
I'm subtracting this from both
sides of the equation.

214
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,850
So I get minus 10.5 times
10 to the minus 4.

215
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,540
Now, this is a quadratic
equation here.

216
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,170
And actually, I'll throw
you a little--

217
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,590
We can solve this quadratic
equation.

218
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,140
We'll get the answer.

219
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,870
In fact, I'm about
to solve it.

220
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,550
But there is an approximation
you can do.

221
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,400
Because if you look at this
quadratic equation, this term

222
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,330
here, x squared, dominates
this term right here.

223
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,460
Even when you have relatively
small values of x, it

224
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,890
dominates that term.

225
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,020
So if chemists look at
this and they say

226
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,270
hey, you know what?

227
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,510
   

228
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,450
If this term is so much smaller
than what's going on

229
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,810
here, in a lot of the cases,
you might be able

230
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,590
to just ignore it.

231
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,310
And then the problem becomes
very simple.

232
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,250
Because if you ignore this term,
it's still a quadratic,

233
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,850
but you don't have to use
a quadratic equation.

234
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,420
Actually I'll do it on
the side right here.

235
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,140
I'll just do it in a box.

236
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,020
Because this isn't the exact
answer, but it's going to get

237
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,640
it's pretty close to
the exact answer.

238
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,120
So in this-- I'll make a
nice little box here.

239
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
I'll make a box.

240
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,490
So if we just ignored this term,
then we'd have x squared

241
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,600
is equal to this.

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,820
Is equal to minus-- you would
add this to the other side, so

243
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,070
you would have plus 10.5 times
10 to the minus 4.

244
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,865
Or x would be equal do the
square root of this.

245
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:07,030
x would be equal to-- what?

246
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:13,420
See, 10.5-- I see you have to
put the exponent thing here.

247
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,120
So exponent for minus
all right.

248
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,460
And I want to take the square
root, so to the 0.5 power is

249
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,040
equal to 0.0324.

250
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,880
So this is 0.0324.

251
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
So if we make that simplifying
assumption, we've essentially

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,400
solved four our hydrogen
concentration, right?

253
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,980
That was x.

254
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,780
This is x.

255
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,380
So this is 0.0324.

256
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,880
And if we want to figure out
the pH, we just take the

257
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,930
negative log of this.

258
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,230
So let's do that.

259
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,460
So you take the log of it.

260
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,045
If you just press log,
that's base 10.

261
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:58,170
So you take the log.

262
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,550
And we want the negative of
that, so you just say minus

263
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,290
1.489, so about 1.49.

264
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,710
So it's a pH of 1.49.

265
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,400
But remember, I did that using
my little simplifying

266
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,725
assumption.

267
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,090
It does not solve the
quadratic equation.

268
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,670
Now let's solve it, just to kind
of confirm in our heads

269
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,240
that we get the right answer.

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,580
Because that's actually
the right way to

271
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,460
get the right answer.

272
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,150
So quadratic equation.

273
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,050
Minus b.

274
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,220
So x is going to be equal
to-- let me do it here.

275
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,230
x is equal to minus b.

276
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,610
So minus 7 times 10 to the
minus 4 plus or minus the

277
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,030
square root of b squared.

278
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:45,280
So b squared is 49 times 10
to the minus 8, right?

279
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
7 squared.

280
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,200
And then 10 to the
minus 4 squared.

281
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,040
Is minus 4 times 2 is minus 8.

282
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,810
Minus 4 times a, which
is 1, times c.

283
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,110
Well, c is a minus sign there--
we have this minus

284
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,550
sign, so it becomes plus.

285
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,360
So 4 times 10.5 times 10
to the negative 4.

286
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,860
That's what?

287
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,390
That's 42 times 10 to the
minus fourth power.

288
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,690
All of that over 2a.

289
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,730
a is just 1.

290
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,730
All of that over 2.

291
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,610
So let's see what we
can get in this

292
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,200
square root right here.

293
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,220
And notice, this is a very small
number compared to this.

294
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,390
This is really all we should
care about with the square

295
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,020
root, but let's just do it.

296
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:42,970
So 49 e 8 negative plus, so
that's that small number--

297
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:50,560
plus 42 times 10 to the
negative-- or to the 4

298
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,200
negative, is equal to that.

299
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,940
So that's this value
right here.

300
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,740
And now we want to take
the square root.

301
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,570
So to the 0.5 power
is equal to 0.06.

302
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,680
So so far, we get x is equal
to-- I will arbitrarily switch

303
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,050
colors-- minus 7 times
10 to the minus 4

304
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,940
plus or minus 0.0648.

305
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,250
All of that over 2.

306
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,750
And it should be clear.

307
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,950
If we subtract it right here,
we get a negative number.

308
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,640
This is already a negative, so
if we subrtact it, we get a

309
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,160
negative numbers.

310
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,150
So let's just worry about the
plus sign because we can't

311
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,180
have a negative concentration.

312
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,300
So if we add that to this right
there, so we have 0.06,

313
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,470
and then we have minus--

314
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,200
Actually let me make sure
that the minus is there.

315
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,170
So it's minus 7 times 10.

316
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,310
Right.

317
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,450
I just want to make sure I'm
not making a mistake by

318
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,700
putting a minus there.

319
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,040
   

320
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,210
No.

321
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,660
It looks right.

322
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,830
So let's see.

323
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,350
So we just do our math.

324
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,120
So we take this and
we subtract that.

325
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,650
   

326
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,620
So it's minus-- I want
to make sure you can

327
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,540
see what I'm doing.

328
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:30,370
So we have minus 7 e 4 negative
is equal to that and

329
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,900
then we have to divide by 2.

330
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,610
Divided by 2 is equal
to 0.032.

331
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,100
So 0.032.

332
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,170
And remember, this is our
hydrogen concentration.

333
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,540
It's also going to be our
concentration of, of course,

334
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,440
our fluorine ions.

335
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
We don't care about that.

336
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,230
We just want to figure
out the pH.

337
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,670
So this is 0.032, which
is very close to our

338
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,510
approximation before.

339
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,310
But now we have the
exact number.

340
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,180
So let's take the log
of it, and then take

341
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,970
the minus of that.

342
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,150
So the log of that.

343
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,990
And then you want to put a minus
in front of the log.

344
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,920
So the exact pH is
right there.

345
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:17,310
So our pH of hydrofluoric
acid is equal to 1.49.

346
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,869
So once again, pretty low pH.

347
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:28,020
But notice, this pH--
this is 1.5 molar of

348
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,850
hydrofluoric acid.

349
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:37,060
While 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid was even more acidic.

350
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,110
It had a pH of 0.

351
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,190
So even though we put more acid
here, we didn't get our

352
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,810
pH as low as when we used only
1 molar of hydrochloric acid.

353
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,160
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
