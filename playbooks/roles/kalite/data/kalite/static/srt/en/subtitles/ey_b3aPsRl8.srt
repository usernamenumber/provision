1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,770
Simplify the rational
expression

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,680
and state the domain.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,790
Let's see if we can start with
the domain part of the

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,410
question, if we can start
with stating the domain.

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,030
Now, the domain is the set of
all of the x values that you

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,690
can legitimately input into
this if you view this as a

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,210
function, if you said this is
f of x is equal to that.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,150
The domain is a set of all x
values that you could input

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,210
into this function and
get something that is

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,330
well-defined.

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,300
The one x value that would make
this undefined is the x

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,210
value that would make the
denominator equal 0-- the x

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,690
value that would make
that equal 0.

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,710
So when does that happen?

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,850
Six minus x is equal to 0.

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,860
Let's add x to both sides.

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:48,950
We get 6 is equal to x, so the
domain of this function is

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:01:02,200
equal to the set of all
real numbers except 6.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,570
So, x could be all real numbers
except 6, because if x

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,220
is 6 then you're dividing
by 0, and then this

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,290
expression is undefined.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,580
We've stated the domain, now
let's do the simplifying the

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,510
rational expression.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,000
Let me rewrite it over here.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,260
We have x squared minus
36 over 6 minus x.

27
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,120
Now, this might jump out at you
immediately, as it's that

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,650
special type of binomial.

29
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,830
It's of the form a squared minus
b squared, and we've

30
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,310
seen this multiple times.

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,160
This is equivalent to a plus
b times a minus b.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,390
And in this case, a
is x and b is 6.

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,400
This top expression right here
can be factored as x plus 6

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,120
times x minus 6, all of
that over 6 minus x.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Now, at first you might say,
I have a x minus 6

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,390
and a 6 minus x.

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,660
Those aren't quite equal, but
what maybe will jump out at

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,750
you is that these are the
negatives of each other.

39
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,710
Try it out.

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,130
Let's multiply by negative 1 and
then by negative 1 again.

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,000
Think of it that way.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,110
If I multiply by negative 1
times negative 1, obviously,

43
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,890
I'm just multiplying the
numerator by 1, so I'm not in

44
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,780
any way changing
the numerator.

45
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,390
What happens if we just multiply
the x minus 6 by that

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,490
first negative 1?

47
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,190
What happens to that
x minus 6?

48
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,850
Let me rewrite the
whole expression.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,300
We have x plus 6, and I'm
going to distribute this

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,740
negative 1.

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,400
If I distribute the negative 1,
I have negative 1 times x

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,050
is negative x.

53
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,020
Negative 1 times negative
6 is plus 6.

54
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,780
And then I have a negative
1 out here.

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,540
I have a negative 1 times
negative 1, and all of that is

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,960
over 6 minus x.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
Now, negative plus 6.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,600
This is the exact same thing
as 6 minus x if you just

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,080
rearrange the two terms.
Negative x plus 6 is the same

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,950
thing as 6 plus negative
x, or 6 minus x.

61
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,820
Now you could cancel them out.

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,650
6 minus x divided by 6 minus x,
and all you're left with is

63
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:18,450
a negative 1-- I'll write it
out front-- times x plus 6.

64
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,170
If you want, you can distribute
it and you would

65
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,900
get negative x minus 6.

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,290
That's the simplified
rational expression.

67
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,300
In general, you don't have to
go through this exercise,

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,120
multiplying by a negative
1 and a negative 1.

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,490
But you should always be able
recognize that if you have a

70
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,410
minus b over b minus a that that
is equal to negative 1.

71
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,510
Or think of it this way: a
minus b is equal to the

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,670
negative of b minus a.

73
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,240
If you distribute this negative
sign, you get

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,890
negative b plus a, which
is exactly what

75
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,720
this is over here.

76
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,450
We're all done.

77
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,733
