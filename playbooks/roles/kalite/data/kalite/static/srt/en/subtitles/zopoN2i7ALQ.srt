1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,370
What I want to do in this video
is try to understand how

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,960
two proteins can interact with
each other in conjunction with

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,210
ATP to actually produce
mechanical motion.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,320
And the reason why I want to
do this-- one, it occurs

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,570
outside of muscle cells as well,
but this is really going

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,025
to be the first video on really
how muscles work.

8
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:23,310
And then we'll talk about how
nerves actually stimulate

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,080
muscles to work.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,580
So it'll all build up
from this video.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,000
So what I've done here is I've
copy and pasted two images of

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,480
proteins from Wikipedia.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,470
This is myosin.

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,110
It's actually myosin II because
you actually have two

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,410
strands of the myosin protein.

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,150
They're interwound around each
other so you can see it's this

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,040
very complex looking protein or
enzyme, however you want to

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,696
talk about it.

19
00:00:46,696 --> 00:00:48,430
I'll tell you why it's called
an enzyme-- because it

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:53,030
actually helps react ATP into
ADP and phosphate groups.

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,460
So that's why it's
called an ATPase.

22
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,150
It's a subclass of the
ATPase enzymes.

23
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,530
This right here is actin.

24
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,850
What we're going to see in
this video is how myosin

25
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,920
essentially uses the ATP to
essentially crawl along.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,830
You can almost view it as an
actin rope and that's what

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,790
creates mechanical energy.

28
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,490
So let me draw it.

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,240
I'll actually draw it on
this actin right here.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,280
So let's say we have one
of these myosin heads.

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,740
So when I say a myosin head,
this is one of the myosin

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,140
heads right here and then it's
connected, it's interwound,

33
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,060
it's woven around.

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,630
This is the other one and it
winds around that way.

35
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,900
Now let's just say we're
just dealing with one

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,730
of the myosin heads.

37
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,050
Let's say it's in
this position.

38
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,450
Let me see how well
I can draw it.

39
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,370
Let's say it starts off in a
position that looks like that

40
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,650
and then this is kind of the
tail part that connects to

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,480
some other structural and we'll
talk about that in more

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,580
detail, but this is my myosin
head right there in its

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,490
starting position, not
doing anything.

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,990
Now, ATP can come along and bond
to this myosin head, this

45
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,940
enzyme, this protein,
this ATPase enzyme.

46
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,210
So let me draw some ATP.

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,820
So ATP comes along and bonds
to this guy right here.

48
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,850
Let's say that's the-- and it's
not going to be this big

49
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,940
relative to the protein,
but this is just to

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,240
give you the idea.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,120
So soon as the ATP binds to its
appropriate site on this

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,400
enzyme or protein, the enzyme,
it detaches from the actin.

53
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,520
So let me write this down.

54
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:44,560
So one, ATP binds to myosin
head and as soon as that

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:58,390
happens, that causes the myosin
to release actin.

56
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,720
So that's step one.

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,050
So I start it off with this guy
just touching the actin,

58
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,570
the ATP comes, and
it gets released.

59
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,570
So in the next step-- so after
that step, it's going to look

60
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,815
something like this--
and I want to draw

61
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,990
it in the same place.

62
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,300
After the next step,
it's going to look

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,810
something like this.

64
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,060
It will have released.

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,910
   

66
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:25,160
So now it looks something like
that and you have the ATP

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,870
attached to it still.

68
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,970
I know it might be a little
bit convoluted when I keep

69
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,450
writing over the same thing,
but you have the

70
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,610
ATP attached to it.

71
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,320
Now the next step-- the ATP
hydrolizes, the phosphate gets

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,430
pulled off of it.

73
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,330
This is an ATPase enzyme.

74
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,320
That's what it does.

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,570
Let me write that down.

76
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:54,250
   

77
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,670
And what that does, that
releases the energy to cock

78
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,030
this myosin protein into kind
of a high energy state.

79
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,370
So let me do step two.

80
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,310
This thing-- it gets
hydrolized.

81
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,250
It releases energy.

82
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,500
We know that ATP is the energy
currency of biological

83
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,290
systems. So it releases
energy.

84
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,579
I'm drawing it as a little spark
or explosion, but you

85
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,010
can really imagine it's changing
the confirmation of--

86
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,540
it kind of spring-loads this
protein right here to go into

87
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,750
a state so it's ready to
crawl along the myosin.

88
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,500
So in step two-- plus energy,
energy and then this-- you can

89
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,500
say it cocks the myosin
protein or

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,410
enzyme to high energy.

91
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,940
You can imagine it winds the
spring, or loads the spring.

92
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,650
   

93
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,820
And confirmation for proteins
just mean shape.

94
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,970
So step two-- what happens is
the phosphate group gets--

95
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,830
they're still attached, but
it gets detached from

96
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,950
the rest of the ATP.

97
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,770
So that becomes ADP and that
energy changes the

98
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,420
confirmation so that this
protein now goes into a

99
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,230
position that looks like this.

100
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,545
So this is where we end up
at the end of step two.

101
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:27,490
Let me make sure
I do it right.

102
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,130
So at the end of step
two, it might look

103
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,380
something like this.

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,860
   

105
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,930
So the end of step two,
the protein looks

106
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,560
something like this.

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,260
This is in its cocked
position.

108
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,670
It has a lot of energy
right now.

109
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,620
It's wound up in
this position.

110
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,500
You still have your ADP.

111
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,810
You still have your-- that's
your adenosine and let's say

112
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,780
you have your two phosphate
groups on the ADP and you

113
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,560
still have one phosphate
group right there.

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,490
Now, when that phosphate group
releases-- so let me write

115
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,040
this as step three.

116
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,380
Remember, when we started, we
were just sitting here.

117
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,190
The ATP binds on step one--
actually, it does definitely

118
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,440
bind, at the end of step one,
that causes the myosin protein

119
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,880
to get released.

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,060
Then after step one, we
naturally have step two.

121
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,470
The ATP hydrolyzes into
ADP phosphate.

122
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,850
That releases energy and that
allows the myosin protein to

123
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,230
get cocked into this high energy
position and kind of

124
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,620
attach, you can think of
it, to the next rung

125
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,480
of our actin filament.

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,965
Now we're in a high
energy state.

127
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:47,160
   

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,700
In step three, the phosphate
releases.

129
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:57,750
   

130
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,980
The phosphate is released from
myosin in step three.

131
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,170
That's step three right there.

132
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,260
That's a phosphate group
being released.

133
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,320
And what this does is, this
releases that energy of that

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,150
cocked position and it causes
this myosin protein

135
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,290
to push on the actin.

136
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,730
This is the power stroke, if
you imagine in an engine.

137
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,070
This is what's causing the
mechanical movement.

138
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,390
So when the phosphate group is
actually released-- remember,

139
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,470
the original release
is when you take

140
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,430
ATP to ADP in a phosphate.

141
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,030
That put it in this
spring-loaded position.

142
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,925
When the phosphate releases it,
this releases the spring.

143
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:41,090
   

144
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,430
And what that does is it pushes
on the actin filament.

145
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,930
   

146
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,720
So you could view this
as the power stroke.

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,750
We're actually creating
mechanical energy.

148
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,130
So depending on which one you
want to view as fixed-- if you

149
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,930
view the actin as fixed,
whatever myosin is attached to

150
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,360
it would move to the left.

151
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,530
If you imagine the myosin being
fixed, the actin and

152
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,190
whatever it's attached to
would move to the right,

153
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,900
either way.

154
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,540
But this is where
we fundamentally

155
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,950
get the muscle action.

156
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,295
And then step four-- you
have the ADP released.

157
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:21,170
   

158
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,960
And then we're exactly where
we were before we did step

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,260
one, except we're just one rung
further to the left on

160
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,890
the actin molecule.

161
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,530
So to me, this is
pretty amazing.

162
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,000
We actually are seeing how ATP
energy can be used to-- we're

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,570
going from chemical energy
or bond energy in ATP to

164
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,820
mechanical energy.

165
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,060
   

166
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,080
For me, that's amazing because
when I first learned about

167
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,640
ATP-- people say, you use ATP to
do everything in your cells

168
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,650
and contract muscles.

169
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,350
Well, gee, how do you go from
bond energy to actually

170
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,850
contracting things, to actually
doing what we see in

171
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,010
our everyday world as
mechanical energy?

172
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,390
And this is really where
it all occurs.

173
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,140
This is really the core issue
that's going on here.

174
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,110
And you have to say, well, gee,
how this thing change

175
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,290
shape and all that?

176
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,320
And you have to remember,
these proteins, based on

177
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
what's bonded to it and
what's not bonded to

178
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,260
it, they change shape.

179
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,810
And some of those shapes take
more energy to attain, and

180
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,610
then if you do the right things,
that energy can be

181
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,440
released and then it can
push another protein.

182
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,920
But I find this just
fascinating.

183
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,100
And now we can build up from
this actin and myosin

184
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,930
interactions to understand how
muscles actually work.
