1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,510
Problem 133.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,500
A certain country had a total annual expenditure

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,330
of 1.2 times 10 to the 12th power last year.

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,290
If the population of the country was 240 million last year,

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,000
what was the per capita expenditure?

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,320
So 240 million, what is that?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,150
A million is 10 to the sixth power.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,380
So this is 240 times 10 to the sixth.

9
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,600
And that's the same thing as 24 times 10 to the seventh.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,800
I just took 10 from here and multiply 10 there.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,710
And that is equal to 2.4 times 10 to the eighth power.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,740
Divide this by 10 and multiply this by 10.

13
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,060
You get the same number. So 2.4 times 10 to the eighth.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,630
So the per capita income is going to be equal to

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,550
the total annual expenditure,

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,680
so 1.2 times 10 to the 12th, divided by the population,

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,670
2.4 times 10 to the eighth.

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,270
1.2 divided by 2.4, that's equal to 0.5,

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,760
that's exactly half of that,

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,630
times 10 to the 12th divided by 10 to the eighth.

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,760
You just subtract the exponents, so that's 10 to the fourth.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,770
And that's not one of the answers,

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,870
so we can multiply this 10 and divide this by 10.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,500
So this becomes 5 times 10 to the third.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,770
Ten to the third is 1,000, so 5 times 1,000 is equal to

26
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,480
$5,000 in annual expenditure per capita.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:54,720
And that's choice E. Problem 134.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,160
A certain rectangular window is twice as long as it is wide.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,500
So if this is the width,its length is 2 times the width.

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,840
If its perimeter is 10 feet, and its dimensions are,

31
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,100
so its perimeter going to be w plus w plus the 2 lengths.

32
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,010
So its perimeter is going to be 2w plus 2w plus w plus w.

33
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,440
And that's going to be equal to 10.

34
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,030
If we add up all the w's,that's 2, 4, 5, 6.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,760
So we get 6w is equal to 10.

36
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:45,180
w is equal to 10/6, which is equal to 5/3 feet.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,810
And so its dimensions are 5/3 and then the 2w.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,730
So the length is 2 times that, which is 10/3.

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,230
So it's 10/3 by 5/3. And that's choice B.

40
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,070
They say 5/3 by 10/3,but same thing. So choice B.

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:14,190
Problem 135. This is interesting.

42
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's see if I can draw this diagram.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,720
So to start, this is x,

44
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,910
then it goes there and has a diamond like that,

45
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,480
and it goes like that.

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,880
And we have another diamond.

47
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,080
I don't know what this is all for yet,

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,930
but it looks interesting.

49
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,050
It goes like that, then goes like that.

50
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,340
There's a diamond there, looks like there.

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,300
There's a line that goes like that,

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,970
goes like that, like that, and like that.

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,790
And then finally, we're at y.

54
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,510
The diagram above shows of various paths along which

55
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,000
a mouse can travel from point x where does it lead to point y

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
where there's a reward with a food pellet.

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,400
How many different paths from x to y can the mouse take

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,940
if it goes directly from x to y

59
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,290
without retracing any point along the path?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,130
There's only one way. It has to go here.

61
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,040
So we're only at 1 path right now.

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,360
And it can either go this way to get here,

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,790
or it could go this way.

64
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,730
So to get here, there's how many different paths?

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,120
Like that, or like that.

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,570
So at this point there's 2 ways to get right there.

67
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,550
There's 1 way to get here,2 ways to get here.

68
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,630
Now, if there's 2 ways to get here,

69
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,480
that means that there's 2 ways to get here.

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,510
Now how many ways are there to get here?

71
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,190
There's each of the 2 ways to get there,

72
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,840
and now we each of those in combination with

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,680
each of these 2 ways, so there's 4 ways to get here.

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,210
You could think of it like this.

75
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,980
You could go to the top 1 and the top, that's 1.

76
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,770
Top and the bottom, 2. Bottom and the bottom, 3.

77
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,620
Bottom and the top, 4.

78
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,100
So you could just multiply how many ways it takes to get here,

79
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,820
and then how many more ways to get from here to here.

80
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,250
From here to here, there's 2 possible ways,

81
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,060
and there's already 2 ways to get here,

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,370
so you could multiply the 2.

83
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,030
So there's 4 ways to get here,4 ways to get here.

84
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,950
To get from here to here, there are 3 ways, 1, 2, and 3.

85
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,670
But since there are already 4 ways to get here,

86
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,630
with each of those 4 ways you can go in 3 different ways.

87
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,380
So we multiply by 4 times 3,

88
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,530
so there's 12 ways to get right here.

89
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,930
If there's 12 ways to get here, there's 12 ways to get to y.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,010
So the answer is C, 12. Problem 136.

91
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,150
If the operation circle with a dot in it

92
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,350
is defined by x circle with a dot y,

93
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,490
is equal to the square root of xy,

94
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,810
for all positive numbers x and y.

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,200
So they're saying x and y are greater than 0.

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,140
That's good, because that ensures

97
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,360
we have a positive under the square root sign.

98
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,190
Then they want to know what 5 circle with a dot

99
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,890
45 circle with a dot 60 is equal to.

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:32,560
5 circle 45, that's equal to the square root of 5 times 45.

101
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,240
That's that, and whatever that is we're circling with that.

102
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,650
So what you do when you have x circle y,

103
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,600
you multiply the 2 and then you take the square root.

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,690
So we would multiply 60 times this and

105
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,180
take the square root of the whole thing.

106
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,180
Let's just simplify this.

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,140
This right here is equal to the square root of 5 times 45,

108
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,400
which doesn't look simplifiable at face value.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,550
But if you think about,45 is 9 times 5.

110
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,030
You just want to take out any perfect squares you have there.

111
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,790
So that's equal to 5 times 9 times 5.

112
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,350
And that's equal to square root of 25 times 9.

113
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,920
And that is equal to the square root of 25

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,390
times the square root of 9,

115
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,570
and that's equal to 5 times 3, which is equal to 15.

116
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,740
So this simplifies to 15.

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,160
And 15 dot circle, whatever you want to call it, 60,

118
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,190
is equal to the square root of 15 times 60.

119
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,450
And let's see if we can

120
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,430
somehow turn this into some type of a perfect square.

121
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,020
Let's rewrite this as-- 60 is the same thing as 15 times 4.

122
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,180
So this is equal to the square root of

123
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,700
15 times 15 times the square root of 4.

124
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,290
The square root of 15 times 15 is going to be 15 times 2,

125
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,830
I'll do it in yellow.

126
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,260
A bar over a sequence of digits in a decimal indicates that

127
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,060
the sequence repeats indefinitely.

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,100
What is the value of 10 to the fourth minus 10

129
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:40,410
to the 12 times 0.0012,

130
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,080
and then this 12 will just keep repeating over and over again

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,040
So let's see what we can do.

132
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,480
What's 10 to the fourth?

133
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,660
Let's think about it this way.

134
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,480
Let's distribute this.

135
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,590
So what's 10 to the fourth? That's 10,000.

136
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:09,810
So what's 10,000 times this number, 0.0012?

137
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,170
This 12 keeps repeating,so we'll think about that in a second.

138
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:21,820
So what's 12 times 10,000?

139
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,940
It's 120,000.

140
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,280
It's 12 with four 0's,

141
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,910
And we have 4 numbers behind the decimal point,

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,760
so it gets us there.

143
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,860
You might say OK, we're done. It's 12.

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,170
But it's actually not 12, because it's actually 121212.

145
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,700
The 12's just keep going.

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,360
It would actually be 121212,

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,770
and then 12's keep repeating on like that.

148
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,370
I think you understand why, right?

149
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
This would be if we just had 1 12 times 10,000,

150
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,000
but if the 12's kept going, then these wouldn't be 0's,

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,270
these would be 12's.

152
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,760
Hopefully that make sense to you,

153
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,070
maybe there's an easy way to think about it.

154
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,000
So what's 100?

155
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,010
We'll use the same logic. What's 100 times 0.0012?

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,720
Actually, I probably could have done it a simpler way,

157
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,080
but let's just continue this way.

158
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,800
So 12 times 100 1,200,

159
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,710
and we have 4 numbers behind the decimal point, 1, 2, 3, 4.

160
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,470
And of course, it's not just 0.12, it'll just keep going.

161
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,420
0.1212 will just keep going.

162
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,890
So we have this times this,

163
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,020
which is this minus this times this.

164
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,910
I'm just distributing it.

165
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,460
So if I just subtract this from that, minus 0.12--

166
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,170
I wrote this right.

167
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,190
This was 12, because we said 12 times 10,000 is 120,000.

168
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,320
We had 1, 2, 3, 4 behind the decimal. So it's 12.

169
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,420
But since we had multiple 12's behind it, it becomes 12.12.

170
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,300
I don't know what I was doing with this right here.

171
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,180
So let me write that again.

172
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,790
Sorry I'm doing this a little bit messy.

173
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:27,880
So 0.0012 repeating times 10 to the fourth

174
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,790
is going to be equal to 12.12 repeating.

175
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,300
And then we're going to subtract 0.0012 repeating

176
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,770
times 10 squared, and that is equal to 0.12 repeating.

177
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,620
So if I subtract out the 0.12 repeating from 12.12 repeating,

178
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,300
I'm just going to be left with 12.

179
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,940
And hopefully that's one of the answers. It is. Choice E.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,130
