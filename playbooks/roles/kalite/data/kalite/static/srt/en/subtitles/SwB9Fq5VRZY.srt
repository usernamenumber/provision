1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,875
If you were to borrow money for different amounts of time, you could imagine the person lending you the money

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:13,267
might charge you a different annual interest rate depending on the perceived risk of having the money out there for that amount of time.

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:17,067
And the same thing is true when people lend money to the federal government.

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:21,000
So when you think about U.S. Treasuries and U.S. Treasuries that have different maturity

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,194
- and maturity just means: When is the government going to pay you back -

6
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:30,267
You could imagine that there are different interest rates or there are different yields to maturity on that debt.

7
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:37,872
So if we were to plot it. So let's say that - and I'm just going to simplify here - let's say that there is some Treasury debt that is maturing in one month.

8
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:49,800
And if you look at the price that you would have to pay for that debt versus the amount of money that the Treasury is going to pay you when it matures, you see that the yield there is, let's say it is 1%.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:59,838
Let's say for Treasuries that are maturing in 3 months, the yield is 1.5%.

10
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:10,240
Let's say the Treasuries that are maturing in - I'll just pick some maturity dates here - let's say in 1 year. In 1 year, the yield is 3%.

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:26,533
Let's do a couple more. Let's say in 10 years - so if you were to literally, you're essentially lending money to the Treasury for 10 years now - the annual interest rate on that, let's say it's 3.5%.

12
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,073
Let's throw one more up here.

13
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's say that if you were to lend money to the U.S. government for 30 years, the yield is running at 4%.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,659
So here we have different yields for different maturities.

15
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:45,067
And if we essentially plot this on a graph, we get ourselves a yield curve. And it's usually called "the" yield curve.

16
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:51,247
When people talk about "the" yield curve they're talking about plot for U.S. Treasury Bills and Bonds in dollars.

17
00:01:51,247 --> 00:02:01,185
You can have a yield curve really for any debt instrument - for any corporate bonds or even government securities or corporate securities of other countries.

18
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:05,133
But in general when they talk about "the" yield curve, they're talking about U.S. Treasuries.

19
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:09,730
So let me draw a yield curve right over here.

20
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:16,667
So on this axis I will put maturity. Scroll down a little bit. So, maturity.

21
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:27,533
And we have a bunch of different maturities. We have one month, we have three months - and this won't be completely to scale - then we have one year.

22
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:30,396
Actually, one month and three months, let's just put one month right at the beginning.

23
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,333
So one month, then three months is a little bit further out.

24
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,643
One year would be right over here.

25
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:40,667
Five years would be, like, there. Five years. Oh, I don't have a five years.

26
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:49,933
Let's do a ten years - so extend my line over. So one year, maybe 10 years is over here, and then you have 30 years.

27
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:54,133
I'll just draw 30 years as far as I can. It's not completely to scale, but it's my best shot.

28
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,678
And then we plot the yield for those different maturities.

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,400
So in one month, you have a 1% yield.

30
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,667
So let me do the percentages here. So this is 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%.

31
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:12,667
So on one month maturity, the yield is 1%.

32
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:17,718
On three month maturity, the yield is 1.5%, so maybe it'll be like right over there.

33
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:24,405
On one year maturity, the yield is 3%. So you plot 1 year, this is 3% right over here.

34
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:33,000
This is 1.5% right over there, the first one right over there was 1%.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,400
And then at 10 years it's 3.5%. So 3.5% is right over here. We want that to be 10 years, just plotting that point.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,067
And then at 30 years, it's 4%. So 4% is what we get at 30 years.

37
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:54,200
And if we connect the dots and draw a curve, we are giving ourselves the yield curve.

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:04,994
You have a curve that might look something like that.

39
00:04:04,994 --> 99:59:59,999
Just by looking at this yield curve, you see that when you lend money to the Treasury for a longer period of time, you get a higher rate of interest than you would for a shorter period of time.
