2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:07,809
We're standing here beside the Arch of Constantine.

3
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,839
This is Beth Harris and Steven Zucker and Valentina Follo.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,895
We're seeing it against the backdrop of the Colosseum.

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:18,595
Maybe we should start with "What's so important about the Arch of Constantine?"

6
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,369
There were many arches in Rome. Few remain today...

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:26,184
... so few are visible for tourists so far, and students walking through the streets of Rome.

8
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,846
And they were dedicated to victorious generals usually

9
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:33,302
to celebrate their victory over another country.

10
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:36,666
They're usually located in strategic areas of the city

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,002
because of course they needed to send a message

12
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,427
and therefore they were located in a specific point.

13
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:47,184
The arch was dedicated to Constantine for a victory over another Roman, actually.

14
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:51,020
There's a time in Roman history where the Empire is starting to have time of unrest

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,341
so there were different people fighting for the same seat... to become emperors.

16
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:59,518
And Constantine won so in reality it's very strange

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,234
because you see a monument celebrating a victory of a Roman over another Roman.

18
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:05,468
- Almost a kind of a civil war, in a sense...

19
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:07,207
Exactly... it was a civil war and actually,

20
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,267
usually triumphal arch was always dedicated to victories over other countries

21
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:15,811
to show the actual spread of Roman strength abroad.

22
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:18,997
- So that's interesting... this arch really then is an expression of

23
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,676
really a point of turmoil in Roman history

24
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:24,309
and in a sense it's really about the unification of Rome.

25
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:29,937
Yes, it's a moment when actually finally Constantine was able to take back all the power in his hands.

26
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:34,683
And it's actually very interesting because it's also located along the route of the Triupmhal way.

27
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:39,564
After a triumph the most important generals would be able to parade along the streets of Rome,

28
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:42,268
??? [showing] what they accomplished...

29
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,739
so they were able to show the animals that they captured, prisoners,

30
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,020
spoils - all the objects that had been taken, works of art...

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,066
- So the Arch functions then as a lasting reminder of that celebration and that pride.

32
00:01:54,066 --> 00:02:00,372
Exatcly. And usually the panels that are on the arch depict scenes about this triumph.

33
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,874
- So should we go take a look?

34
00:02:01,874 --> 00:02:05,164
Yes, we can take a look... Constantine decided to use some of the spoils...

35
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:10,185
... not directly from this war but from other monuments within the city of Rome.

36
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:15,064
He took pieces from pre-existing monuments to prove the point.

37
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:21,932
It wanted to show that he was really a good emperor and so he picked pieces from emperors who were considered as good emperors.

38
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:27,230
Becoming emperor after a civil was was never a good thing, right, so you need to prove yourself.

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,470
It was a difficult time - it was a time of unrest, we had a lot of wars... not just civil but also with other population.

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,925
It went back to what was considered the golden age of Rome.

41
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,807
Skipping a century and going back...

42
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:42,102
- Might be like president Obama saying 'I'm like John F. Kennedy.'

43
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:44,241
Exactly, it's like exactly this same point.

44
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:50,299
And he did it not just by saying it but visually by taking pieces from pre-existing monuments.

45
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,189
He had actually the portraits of these emperors and placed it on his own arch.

46
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:57,570
Of course, the portraits were recarved with the face of Constantine.

47
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,739
So the Arch is actually quite monumental in size.

48
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,408
You can read the message going usually from the bottom to the top...

49
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,309
and at the bottom we have the scenes of victories - sort of angels...

50
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,067
it's ??? [not that] the predecesors of the angels...

51
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,133
- Oh I see this is like a niche.

52
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,094
It's a niche, it's a ???

53
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,144
- A symbol of victory.

54
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,261
Yeah, exactly. So this ??? a female...

55
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:21,074
and then there are usually prisoners, defeated enemies ... ??? of these victories.

56
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:28,849
So, those are general enemies. Of course, they couldn't show Romans because, you know, you don't show your own people defeated in the same arch.

57
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,685
So, it's taken the usual elements of a triumphal arch.

58
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,351
- But it's a bit more generic here.

59
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:39,135
Exactly, they're kneeling down, you see entire families - the mother, the father, the child...

60
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:44,206
with these very sorrowful faces to show that they are being taken prisoners.

61
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:48,562
Because, of course, the end for prisoners was to become slaves for the city so it was not a happy ending.

62
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,518
Then we go on the second level and we start having these round circles

63
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:56,373
that are actually from a previous monument by Hadrian.

64
00:03:56,373 --> 00:04:00,306
Hadrian was a very important emperor, he was considered a philosopher-emperor...

65
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,184
You see he loved the Greek art, we know that he travelled, had a look at the provinces...

66
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:08,178
So he was this sort of philosopher-emperor that was for the good of the people.

67
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:13,729
They originally narrated scenes of hunting and sacrifice to the gods

68
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:19,183
so they have no connection with a military victory, they have no significance in themselves.

69
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:25,302
But placed within the arch, of course, that's a significant change because you can see the ability of the emperor in every field.

70
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:30,518
So in fact the emperor is a good emperor because he's able to also be a good hunter...

71
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:34,183
- If you think about the front of the American museum of natural history in New York,

72
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:39,684
there you have representations of Theodore Roosevelt represented as a hunter, as a scientist, as a philanthropist

73
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:42,475
and in a sense all of the facets of a...

74
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,241
- of a great leader.

75
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:48,341
So what we see Hadrian doing is the boar hunt, the bear hunt, the lion hunt...

76
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,963
and then again the hunt that is a sacrifice, of course, to thank the gods.

77
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:56,665
What is interesting is that the round panels had been inserted in red stone.

78
00:04:56,665 --> 00:05:00,241
That red stone is typical of the time of Constantine...

79
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:05,426
and it was a special stone called 'porphyry' coming from Egypt that only emperors could use...

80
00:05:05,426 --> 00:05:07,433
and is actually quite a difficult stone to carve.

81
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:13,708
??? ??? something that was 2nd century ??? made of porphyry made it different, because...

82
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,680
- So it's an honour?

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,569
Exactly.

84
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:16,602
- It gives it importance.

85
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:21,517
So it's really Constantine here who is placing Hadrian within the porphyry,

86
00:05:21,517 --> 00:05:26,928
paying real homage to the earlier emperor, showing his respect and in a sense,

87
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:30,100
therefore, taking some of Hadrian's grandeur for himself.

88
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,043
- Then if you go to the top layer, sort of to the top floor, the attic, we see two things:

89
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,932
There are free standing statues of prisoners

90
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:42,511
and they are represented with these strange pants, a short tunic, a mantel (?),

91
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:45,810
and a very weird cap - it's like a pointed soft hat.

92
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,638
These are called 'Phrygian hat' and used to represent foreign people.

93
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:53,933
Remember that pants were only used by barbarians, Romans would use a toga.

94
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:59,802
In this case those are a representation of the nations, the people that Trajan defeated.

95
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:03,427
And they'd been taken probably from the major forum...

96
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:07,180
the major square that Trajan built after the war to celebrate his victory.

97
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,512
- So another taking from another great emperor, the emperor Trajan in this case.

98
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:18,929
But I wonder if we can talk about the styles and all the different ways that things look on the arch.

99
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:24,762
The most important thing is if you go really in the front and we look at the only element

100
00:06:24,762 --> 00:06:29,426
that actually was carved for this arch at the time of Constantine...

101
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:34,131
it's a long frieze - it's actually a representation of the emperor seated on the throne,

102
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:38,962
distributing coins - distributing money to the population in a gesture of largesse.

103
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:44,973
That was a typical element of Roman iconography - the emperor was good, the emperor would distribute to the people,...

104
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,685
he was generous, He was able to redistribute the wealth of the war.

105
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:49,767
- And he's missing his head.

106
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,265
Exactly. He's the one with the missing head.

107
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:56,929
What is important about this panel, if you look at the people, the people are on a smaller scale

108
00:06:56,929 --> 00:07:02,599
with respect to the emperor who's actually on a higher level, the major figure at the frontal.

109
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,640
So it's an idea of something that was going to appear later in art -

110
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,676
the fact that the most important people are looking directly at you from the monument.

111
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:13,350
- So that might remind us of later developments in medieval art.

112
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,847
Exactly. That's actually the beginning of this type of style.

113
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:19,768
If you look at the other panels, you'll se that the emperor is not looking at you.

114
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,073
He's interacting with the other people within the panel.

115
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:25,684
What they wanted to send was a message that the emperor was the most important.

116
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,594
And therefore he was bigger and in a prominent position.

117
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:33,872
- But we're seeing that kind of ??? leading ??? that way of communicating in medieval art

118
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:40,897
where everything is very direct, the most important figure frontal, bigger, with hierarchic (?) scale

119
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:43,344
instead of something that looks very naturalistic.

120
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:48,342
So we're moving away from the kind of classicism of the 1st and 2nd century...

121
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,903
- It's simply a different development.

122
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:56,300
It's simply telling you something different about the society that produced art (because that's what art does),

123
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,106
this fact that the emperor starts detaching himself from the people that he's supposed to watch over.

124
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:05,538
- Interesting. Because I think many people would look at the frieze and see these forms...

125
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:10,761
not only as more hierarchic but also as, in a sense, more symbolically represented, right.

126
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,509
I mean, you mentioned before the greater naturalism of the medallions

127
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:19,195
and here the figures seem, I think, to many people's eyes less studied.

128
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:23,369
- This seems to be produced by somebody not really able to carve in certain cases.

129
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:33,376
The fact is that partially it is true that one reason that some of the scholars aduced to the fact that Constantine reused elements from the previous monuments is...

130
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:39,259
... the fact that when he let to built to arch there were not so many artists able to produce something as before.

131
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,766
Other scholars actually say that it's a sign of the influence of what is called 'popular art' -

132
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:48,287
the art that people, the regular people, had been using for centuries.

133
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:53,021
Because if you look at monuments like funerary monuments of the middle class,

134
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:56,972
even in the 1st and 2nd century, they are not so different.

135
00:08:56,972 --> 00:09:04,062
- So the suggestion is being made by some scholars that this more popular art is really ??? directly to the middle classes...

136
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:12,371
and in a sense you're ??? their style as opposed to a much more sort of elaborate and perhaps rarified kind of style.

137
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:13,924
So we're really having a political purpose.

138
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:17,873
??? these kinds of influences from the lower classes to the upper classes.

139
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:23,935
- When you think of much later, it is like in the 19th century when they are intentionally drawing on folk art...

140
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:32,564
or the art of untrained, or less trained, people than the official government trained or ??? trained style.

141
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:35,429
??? have a very different motivation and purpose.

142
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:39,831
- They're hard not to see as a decline or decadence as you said.

143
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:46,373
They stopped knowing how to make the human figure or they just were not able to be trained...

144
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,759
but instead it may be something that was very intentional.

145
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,179
- And of course the ancient Romans were credited with really perfecting the arch and using it for architechtural purposes and so.

146
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,865
We can see very clearly the keystone and the voussoirs and the impost.

147
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,269
- The arch has been used in the Roman architecture as a development...

148
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:09,434
And here it's just something beautiful that you can decorate so it's like ??? a form has been embellished.

149
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,905
??? ??? ??? still a passageway

150
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,321
but you know you don't need this type of passage within a city.

151
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:20,541
I mean, of course, it's the turning part of this procession, this triumphal procession so it was important.

152
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,037
You know, once upon a time, even we could walk underneath. Now thay fenced it off...

153
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:31,896
in a way detaching the monument from the city. It lost completely the connection from the streets and the people.

154
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:35,350
Now it's just a monument and it's not what it was before anymore.

155
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:43,642
- So ??? would have been connected to the street, and then through the street left, up and to the forum.

156
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:47,463
- The main square of the Romans, the civic core of the city.

157
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:51,768
- So really a gateway, a critical turning point as you said.
