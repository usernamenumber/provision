1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,190
This is the same problem that
we had in the last video.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,620
But instead of trying to figure
out whether the data

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,200
supplies sufficient evidence to
conclude that the engines

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,760
meet the actual emissions
requirement, and all of the

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,220
hypothesis testing, I thought I
would also use the same data

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,170
that we had in the last video to
actually come up with a 95%

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,460
confidence interval.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,620
So you could ignore the
question right here.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,080
You can ignore all of this.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,040
I'm just using that same data
to come up with a 95%

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,960
confidence interval for the
actual mean emission for this

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,310
new engine design.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:40,200
So we want to find a 95%
confidence interval.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,790
And as you could imagine,
because we only have 10

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,770
samples right here, we're
going to want to use a

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,960
T-distribution.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,450
And right down here
I have a T-table.

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,740
And we want a 95% confidence
interval.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,750
So we want to think about the
range of T-values that 95-- or

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,050
the range that 95% of T-values
will fall under.

22
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,190
So let's think about this way.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,180
So let me draw a

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,660
T-distribution right over here.

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,260
So a T-distribution looks
very similar to a normal

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,210
distribution but it
has fatter tails.

27
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,400
This end and this end will be
fatter than in a normal

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,630
distribution.

29
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,510
And then we want to find an
interval, so if this is a

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,150
normalized T-distribution the
mean is going to be 0.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,720
And we want to find interval
of T-values between some

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,740
negative value here and some
positive value here that

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,850
contains 95% of the
probability.

34
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,030
So this right here
has to be 95%.

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,330
And to figure what these
critical T-values are at this

36
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,930
end and this end, we can
just use a T-table.

37
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,280
And we're going to use the
two-sided version of this

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,470
because we're symmetric
around the center.

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,700
So you look at the two-sided,
we want a 95% confidence

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,260
interval, so we're going to
look right over here, 95%

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,340
confidence interval.

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,190
We have 10 data points,
which means we have

43
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,570
9 degrees of freedom.

44
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,330
So 9 degrees of freedom for
our 10 data points.

45
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,980
We just took 10 minus 1.

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,220
So if we look over here, so for
a T-distribution with 9

47
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,950
degrees of freedom, you're
going to have 95% of the

48
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,090
probability is going to be
contained within a T-value

49
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,320
of-- so the T-value is going
to be between negative, so

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,250
this value right here is 2.262,
and this value right

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,620
here is negative 2.262.

52
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,620
That's what this right
here tells us.

53
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,960
That if you contain all the
values that are less than

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,070
2.262 away from the center of
your T-distribution, you will

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,160
contain 95% of the
probability.

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,130
So that is our T-distribution
right there.

57
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,010
Let me make it very clear.

58
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,260
This is our T-distribution.

59
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,150
   

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,280
So if you randomly pick
a T-value from this

61
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,020
T-distribution, it has a 95%
chance of being within this

62
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,930
far from the mean.

63
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,100
Or maybe we should
write this way.

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,290
If I pick a random T-value, if
I take a random T-statistic--

65
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:23,970
let me write it this way--
there's a 95% chance that a

66
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:33,430
random T-statistic is going
to be less than 2.262, and

67
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,210
greater than negative 2.262.

68
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,850
95% percent chance.

69
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,420
Now when we took this sample, we
could also derive a random

70
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,960
T-statistic from this.

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,130
We have our sample mean and our
sample standard deviation,

72
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,690
our sample mean here is

73
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,060
17.17-- figured that out in the
last video, just add these

74
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,640
up, divide by 10-- and
our sample standard

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,950
deviation here is 2.98.

76
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,300
So the T-statistic that we can
derive from this information

77
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,080
right over here-- so let me
write it over here-- the

78
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,870
T-statistic that we could derive
from this, and you can

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,790
view this T-statistic as being
a random sample from a

80
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,769
T-distribution.

81
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,000
A T-distribution with 9
degrees of freedom.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,430
So the T-statistic that we
could derive from that is

83
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:34,810
going to be our mean, 17.17
minus the true mean of our

84
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,780
population.

85
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,190
Or actually you would say the
true mean of our sampling

86
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,640
distribution, which is also
going to be the same as the

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,190
true mean of our population,
because that's our population

88
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:52,080
mean over there, divided by s,
which is 2.98 over the square

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,790
root of our number of samples.

90
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,140
We've seen this multiple
times.

91
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,520
This right here is
the T-statistic.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,820
So by taking this sample you
can say that we've randomly

93
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,070
sampled a T-statistic from
this 9 degree of freedom

94
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,200
T-distribution.

95
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,130
So there's a 95% chance that
this thing right over here is

96
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,420
going to be between-- is going
to be less than 2.262 and

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,920
greater than negative 2.262.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:30,450
So the 95% probability still
applies to this right here.

99
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,840
Now we just have to do some
math, calculate these things.

100
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,300
So let me get my
calculator out.

101
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,690
   

102
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,470
And so let me just
calculate this

103
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,680
denominator right over here.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,130
So we have 2.98 divided by
the square root of 10.

105
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,160
So that's 0.9423.

106
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,100
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to multiply both sides

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,230
of this equation by this
expression right over here.

108
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,940
So if I do that-- so let me just
do that right over-- so

109
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,820
if I multiply this entire-- this
is really two equations

110
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,100
or two inequalities
I should say.

111
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,130
That this quantity is greater
than this quantity and that

112
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,750
this quantity's greater
than that quantity.

113
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,050
But we can operate on all of
them at the same time, this

114
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,730
entire inequality.

115
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,400
So what we want to do is
multiply this entire

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,710
inequality by this value
right over here.

117
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,410
And we just calculated it at
that value-- let me write it

118
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,010
over here-- that 2.98-- I'll
write it right over here--

119
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:39,500
2.98 over the square root
of 10 is equal to 0.942.

120
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,010
So if I multiplied this entire
inequality by 0.942 I get, on

121
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:53,490
this left-hand side over here
I have negative 2.262 times

122
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,160
0.942-- and it's a positive
number that we're multiplying

123
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,510
the whole inequality by, so the
inequality signs are still

124
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,770
going to be in the same
direction-- is less than--

125
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,990
we're multiplying this whole
expression by the same

126
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,780
expression in the denominator
so it'll cancel out.

127
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,090
So we're just going to be less
than 17.17 minus our

128
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,610
population mean, which is going
to be less than 2.262

129
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,740
times, once again, 0.942.

130
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,190
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

131
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,170
0.942.

132
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,260
Just be clear, I'm just
multiplying all three sides of

133
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,160
this inequality by this number
right over here.

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,650
In the middle this
cancels out.

135
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,940
So if I multiply-- I'll just
write it over here-- 0.942,

136
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,010
0.942, 0.942.

137
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,740
This and this is the same number
so that's why those

138
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,530
cancel out.

139
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,180
And now let's get the calculator
to figure out what

140
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,930
these numbers are.

141
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,560
So if we have the 0.942
times 2.262.

142
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,080
So we're going to say
times 2.262 is 2.13.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,800
So this number right
over here on the

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,100
right-hand side is 2.13.

145
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,130
This number on the left is just
the negative of that.

146
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,610
So it's negative 2.13.

147
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,320
And then we still have our
inequalities-- is going to be

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:39,090
less than 17.17 minus the mean,
which is less than 2.13.

149
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,549
Now what I want to do is
I actually want to

150
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,520
solve for this mean.

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,070
And I don't like that negative
sign in the mean.

152
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,580
I'd rather have this
swapped around.

153
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,810
I'd rather have the
mean minus 17.17.

154
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,660
So what I'm going to do is
multiply this entire

155
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,880
inequality by negative 1.

156
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,910
If you do that, if you multiply
the entire thing

157
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,620
times negative 1, this quantity
right here, this

158
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,550
negative 2.13 will become
a positive 2.13.

159
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,940
But since we are multiplying
an inequality by a negative

160
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,080
number you have to swap
the inequality sign.

161
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,660
So this less than will become
a greater than.

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,970
This negative mu will become
a positive mu.

163
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,300
This positive 17.17 will become
a negative 17.17.

164
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,890
We're going to have to swap this
inequality sign as well,

165
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:28,010
and this positive 2.13 will
become a negative 2.13.

166
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,640
And we're almost there.

167
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,120
We just want to solve for mu.

168
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,580
Have this inequality expressed
in terms of mu.

169
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,370
So what we can do is now just
add 17.17 to all three sides

170
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:44,990
of this inequality, and we are
left with 2.13 plus 17.17 is

171
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,810
greater than mu minus 17.17 plus
17.17 is just going to be

172
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,090
mu, which is greater than-- so
this is greater than mu, which

173
00:09:54,090 --> 00:10:00,950
is greater than negative
2.13 plus 17.17.

174
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,910
Or a more natural way to write
it since we actually have a

175
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,830
bunch of greater than signs,
that this is actually the

176
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,780
largest number and this-- oh
sorry, this is actually the

177
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,140
smallest number and this over
here is actually the largest

178
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,520
number, is actually flipped--
you can just re-write this

179
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,970
inequality the other way.

180
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,860
So now we can write-- actually
let's just figure out what

181
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,740
these values are.

182
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,900
So we have 2.13 plus 17.17.

183
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,010
So that is the high
end of our range.

184
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,280
So that is 19.3.

185
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,392
So this value right over here,
so this is 19-- let me do it

186
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:46,210
in that same color-- this value
right here is 19.3 is

187
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,010
going to be greater than mu,
which is going to be greater

188
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,910
than-- and this is negative
2.13 plus 17.17.

189
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:08,460
Or we could have 17.17 minus
2.13, which gives us 15.04.

190
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,810
And remember, the whole thing,
all of this, we started with,

191
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,530
there was a 95% chance that a
random T-statistic will fall

192
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,720
in this interval.

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
We had a random T-statistic,
and all we did

194
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,060
is a bunch of math.

195
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,160
So there's a 95% chance that any
of these steps are true.

196
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,830
So there's a 95% chance
that this is true.

197
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,990
There's a 95% chance that the
true population mean, which is

198
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,850
the same thing as the mean of
the sampling distribution of

199
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,180
the sample mean, there's a 95%
chance, or that we are

200
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,780
confident that there's a 95%
chance, that it will fall in

201
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,750
this interval.

202
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,280
And we're done.

203
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,334
