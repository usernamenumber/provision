1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:02,175
For those of you who are just starting

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:04,750
to learn about the history of China

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,010
in the first half of the 20th century,

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,669
it can be a little bit confusing.

5
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:11,476
So the goal of this video is really

6
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,171
to give you an overview –

7
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:16,336
to give you a scaffold – of the history of

8
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:19,880
the first half of the 20th century in China.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,936
So as we go into the early 1900s,

10
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:27,269
you have the end of imperial dynastic rule in China.

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,466
This is a big deal.

12
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:31,536
China has been ruled by various dynasties

13
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:34,749
for multiple thousands of years.

14
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,205
But as you get into the 1900s, it was getting –

15
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:41,840
the dynastic rule – in particular, the Qing Dynasty –

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,335
was getting weaker and weaker.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,667
It had suffered at the hands of the Japanese

18
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,417
during the first Sino-Japanese War,

19
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,414
at the end of the 1800s.

20
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:53,423
There was growing discontent amongst the opposition

21
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,584
that the dynasty, that the emperors,

22
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,536
were not modernizing China enough.

23
00:00:57,536 --> 00:00:59,337
Remember, this was the early 1900s.

24
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:00,533
The rest of the world was becoming

25
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,209
a very, very modern place.

26
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:05,269
China, in the 1800s, had suffered at the hands of

27
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,535
western powers who were essentially exerting

28
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,604
their own imperial influence in China.

29
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,553
Many people felt that this was because

30
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:16,551
China was not as modernized –

31
00:01:16,551 --> 00:01:18,969
economically, politically and technologically –

32
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:20,470
as it needed to be.

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,937
And so you fast-forward to 1911.

34
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,972
You have what is known as the Wuchang Uprising,

35
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:30,470
which led to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty.

36
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,671
By 1912, the Republic of China was established in Nanjing.

37
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,471
So Nanjing, right over here, was where it was established.

38
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:43,736
Beijing was, of course, the seat of dynastic rule in China.

39
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,883
And the first provisional president

40
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:50,471
of the Republic of China was Doctor Sun Yat-sen,

41
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:51,607
right over here.

42
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,946
And he actually did not directly participate

43
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,298
in this final uprising that finally led

44
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:59,603
to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty.

45
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,468
He was actually in Denver at the time –

46
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:02,744
Denver Colorado (in the USA).

47
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:04,598
But he was a leading – or one of the leading –

48
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:06,921
figures in the run-up to this uprising –

49
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,599
one of the leading figures who was providing opposition,

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,933
and had tried multiple times to overthrow the dynasty.

51
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,254
Now Sun Yat-sen was essentially in cahoots with

52
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:21,926
Yuan Shikai, who was a general in the old dynasty.

53
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:24,324
And he has his own fascinating history.

54
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:27,923
And Sun Yat-sen struck a deal with Yuan Shikai,

55
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,318
who was very politically ambitious.

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,812
Yuan Shikai said, “Hey if I can get the Emperor Puyi,”

57
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,884
(who was the last emperor of China)

58
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:38,221
“if I can get him to officially abdicate,

59
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,716
I want to become the president.”

60
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,215
So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.

61
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,483
So Yuan Shikai becomes the official

62
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:50,928
president of the Republic of China.

63
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:52,557
But that wasn't enough for him.

64
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:56,147
He declares himself emperor in 1915,

65
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:58,482
which, you could imagine, did not make many people happy,

66
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,480
because they were tired of having emperors.

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,988
By 1916, he abdicates – (and he passes away, actually).

68
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:09,454
And this actually begins a period

69
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:13,517
of extremely fragmented rule for China.

70
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,390
Even under imperial rule,

71
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,312
the Chinese military was not one consolidated body.

72
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:21,594
The military was controlled by various warlords

73
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:25,488
in various regions that all had allegiance to the Emperor.

74
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,862
Once you have Yuan Shikai abdicating,

75
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:31,736
and then dying in 1916 – and even prior that,

76
00:03:31,736 --> 00:03:33,731
when he declared himself emperor –

77
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:37,186
people did not want to pledge allegiance to Yuan Shikai.

78
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:38,921
And so you had what is known as

79
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,153
the beginning of the ‘Warlord Era’ in China.

80
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,401
This is a fragmented period where

81
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,739
China did not have any centralized leadership.

82
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,323
And each of these regions here –

83
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:49,718
(This map over here shows kind of

84
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,335
the rough picture of what China looked

85
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:53,062
like during the Warlord Era.) –

86
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:55,213
– each of these regions was controlled by

87
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:59,999
different warlords who were in charge of a different military.

88
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,377
When this was going on during the Warlord era –

89
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,800
especially as we go back into the early 1920s –

90
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,058
in 1921 in particular – Sun Yat-sen hasn't given up.

91
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:13,210
He goes to the south, in Guangzhou, and sets up,

92
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,750
essentially, a revolutionary government out of a desire,

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,501
from there, to consolidate power in China again,

94
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:25,916
and to re-establish the Republic of China.

95
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,183
So he goes there.

96
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:32,264
But unfortunately, he passes away in 1925 from cancer.

97
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:38,736
And the power of the movement that he started –

98
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,593
which is now being referred to as the ‘Kuomintang’ –

99
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,428
(Let me write that down.)

100
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:53,595
WRITING: Kuomintang.’

101
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,599
Essentially, the power then passes on

102
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,134
to Generalissimo Chang Kai Shek.

103
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,733
And Chang Kai Shek – the reason why we say

104
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,091
the power essentially goes to him is because

105
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,663
he was in control of the major part of

106
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,595
the military forces of the Kuomintang.

107
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,942
And these are, essentially, the very nascent, early stages

108
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,871
of what would essentially be the Chinese Civil War –

109
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:22,953
because in the period from 1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death,

110
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,263
you actually had a lot of collaboration between

111
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:29,289
the Chinese Nationalists (the Kuomintang), the Soviet Union,

112
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,614
and the Chinese Communist Party.

113
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:33,369
They were trying to collaborate in order

114
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,922
to think about how China would unify.

115
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,729
But then, once Sun Yat-sen dies,

116
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,534
the power of the Kuomintang goes into the hands

117
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,121
of Generalissimo Chang Kai-shek.

118
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,119
He starts to consolidate power.

119
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,516
He doesn't, right from the get-go,

120
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,789
antagonize the Communists.

121
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,958
But by 1927, he's starting to bring together

122
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,945
these various factions in the rest of China.

123
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,859
So he's able to consolidate power.

124
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:08,722
But he also starts to go after the Communists.

125
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:11,460
So, Chang Kai-shek, by 1927,

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,191
also starts to go after the Communists.

127
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,005
And the Communists were saying,

128
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:16,664
"Hey, we are the ones who really represent

129
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:19,567
the spirit of what Sun Yat-sen represented –

130
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:22,333
while the Kuomintang, under the leadership

131
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,334
of Chang Kai-shek, said,

132
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:27,237
"No no no! We represent what Sun Yat-sen represented

133
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:31,474
when he first established the Republic of China."

134
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,401
And so in 1927, you have the beginning of

135
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:37,000
the Chinese Civil War.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,476
This is when the Kuomintang, as part of its efforts

137
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:42,493
to consolidate power, not only tries to consolidate power

138
00:06:42,493 --> 00:06:46,667
with the warlords, but also goes after the Communist Party.

139
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,002
Now, while all of this is happening,

140
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,667
as we get into the early 1930s,

141
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,065
Japan, once again, is trying to exert

142
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:58,853
its imperial military might on the Chinese mainland.

143
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,852
Japan had already captured Formosa

144
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,726
(which is now known as Taiwan)

145
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,584
and Korea during the first Sino-Japanese War

146
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,329
at the end of the 1800s.

147
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,068
And then in 1931,

148
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:16,203
the Japanese start to encroach on Manchuria.

149
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,812
And this would, essentially, become a multi-year

150
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:23,808
occupation and infiltration of Japan into China.

151
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:26,809
And this continues all the way until 1937

152
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,459
when it becomes an official all-out war

153
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,000
between the Japanese and the Chinese.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,403
And I have a map here that shows kind of

155
00:07:35,403 --> 00:07:40,135
the apex of Japanese control during this period.

156
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,583
And so in East Asia,

157
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,338
between the Chinese and the Japanese,

158
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:49,440
World War II was really just part of the Sino-Japanese War.

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,667
The Japanese had already encroached

160
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,898
on the mainland of China well before

161
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:58,485
World War II had officially begun.

162
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,590
Now, while all of this is happening –

163
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,717
(Japan is encroaching into Manchuria)

164
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:06,259
– In 1934 – you have to remember – the Kuomintang –

165
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,388
the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek –

166
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:11,220
is going after the Communists.

167
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,811
And in 1934, he has them virtually surrounded,

168
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:20,135
The Communists are nearly defeated.

169
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,852
They're surrounded by the Nationalist Party.

170
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:25,518
And this results in what is a fairly famous event

171
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,621
in Chinese history – the famous 'Long March' –

172
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,254
where the Chinese Communist Party – their military –

173
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:34,786
is marched through extremely tough terrain,

174
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:38,343
all the way to the northwest of China.

175
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,186
So this right over here is a map of the Long March.

176
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:45,176
So truly, the Chinese Communist Party seemed to be

177
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:48,418
on the ropes here in 1934.

178
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:50,849
And it was during this Long March that

179
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:54,931
Mao Zedong really started to exert and show leadership.

180
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:57,519
And this is what the leadership during this Long March –

181
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,134
during this retreat to the northwest of China –

182
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:02,668
is really what allowed Mao Zedong to eventually

183
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,286
take control of the Chinese Communist Party.

184
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:08,218
Now as we fast-forward,

185
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:10,059
we know that the Sino-Japanese war –

186
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,727
(Which we can view, eventually,

187
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:14,533
as one theater of operations in World War II.)

188
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:17,269
Eventually, the US goes in on the side of the Allies

189
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:19,327
against Japan after it attacked the US at Pearl Harbor.

190
00:09:19,327 --> 00:09:25,125
And then in 1945, you have the attacks on Japan in the cities of

191
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,692
Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons –

192
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,870
which essentially ends World War II in the Pacific Theater.

193
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,330
It’s a defeat for Japan. Japan lost World War II.

194
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,860
And at this point, full-scale civil war between

195
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,594
the two main parties in China breaks out again.

196
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:43,528
The Chinese Civil War had started in 1927.

197
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:45,594
And it kept continuing.

198
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,912
But then, once there was a common enemy – Japan –

199
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:50,789
that was very aggressively trying to take over

200
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,413
more and more of China's, well, people and resources –

201
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,733
trying to exert its imperial influence –

202
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,268
then you had the two parties kind of

203
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,332
[scale back their hostilities towards each other]

204
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,394
and say, "Hey, we need to focus on fighting the Japanese!”

205
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:04,936
But once World War II ended in 1945 –

206
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:06,486
once the Japanese were defeated,

207
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,897
then we saw a reigniting of full-scale civil war

208
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:12,262
between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang.

209
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,204
And this is probably one of

210
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,797
the biggest comebacks in history.

211
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:16,290
This was the Chinese Communist Party that,

212
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,295
in 1934 and 1935, looked like they were on the ropes –

213
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:24,620
they were, essentially, forced to retreat.

214
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,214
They were able to come back.

215
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:27,068
And in 1949 –

216
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:28,520
(And there are a lot of theories as to

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,390
why they were able to pull this off –

218
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,645
they were able to get much more support

219
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,969
from the rural population – they were more savvy

220
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,393
about getting support generally than the Kuomintang.

221
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:41,062
(We could talk about that in a future video.)

222
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:45,509
But by 1949, they were able to defeat Chang Kai-shek

223
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,462
and the Kuomintang, and force the Kuomintang to flee

224
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:53,869
from the mainland and retreat to Taiwan

225
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:56,664
where they established themselves as a country.

226
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,747
And ever since 1949, on the mainland, we have had –

227
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,745
with its establishment by the leadership of

228
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,973
the Chinese Communist Party –

229
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:05,463
the People's Republic of China.
