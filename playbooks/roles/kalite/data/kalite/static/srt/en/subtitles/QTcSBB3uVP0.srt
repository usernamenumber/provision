1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,090
Let's say I've got some subspace
V, which tends to be

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,750
our favorite letter for
subspaces, and it's equal to

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,170
the span of two vectors in R4.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:17,840
Let's say that the first vector
is 1 0 0 1, and the

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:26,350
second vector is 0 1 0 1.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,210
That is my subspace V.

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,220
And you can see that these
are going to be a basis.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,810
That these are linearly
independent.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,150
Two vectors that are linear-- or
any set of vectors that are

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,380
linearly independent and that
span a subspace are a basis

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,960
for that subspace.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,020
You can see they are linearly
independent.

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,040
This guy's has a 1 here.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,250
There's no way you can take some
combination of this guy

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,820
to somehow get a 1 there.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,960
And this guy has a 1 here.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,730
There's no way you can get some
linear combination of

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,440
these zeroes here
to a 1 there, so

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,050
they're linearly dependent.

21
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,500
You can also call this
a basis for V.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,920
Now, given that, let's see
if we can find out the

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,730
transformation matrix for the
projection of any arbitrary

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,360
vector onto this subspace.

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,440
So let's say that X-- we're
dealing in R4 here, right?

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:21,030
Let's say that x is a member
of R4, and I want to figure

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,170
out a transformation
matrix for the

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,320
projection onto V of x.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,040
Now, in the last video, we came
up with a general way to

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,850
figure this out.

31
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,400
We said if A is a transformation
matrix-- sorry.

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,900
If A is a matrix who's columns
are the basis for the

33
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,350
subspace, so let's say A is
equal to 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,197
So A is a matrix whose columns
are the basis for our

35
00:01:55,197 --> 00:02:00,130
subspace, then the projection
of x onto V would be equal

36
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,350
to-- and this is kind of hard.

37
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,600
The first time you look at, it
gives you a headache, but

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,030
there's a certain pattern or
symmetry or a way of-- you

39
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,140
could say it's A times, you're
gonna have something in the

40
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:17,790
middle, and then you have A
transpose times your vector x.

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,100
And the way I remember it is in
the middle, you have these

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,760
two guys switched around.

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,790
So then you have A transpose
A, and you take

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,040
the inverse of it.

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,820
   

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,940
You probably won't be using
this in your everyday life

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,500
five or ten years from now, so
it's OK if you don't memorize

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,390
it, but temporarily, put this
in your medium-term memory

49
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,110
because it's a good thing
to know for doing these

50
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,490
projection problems.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,640
So if we want to find the
general matrix for this

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,790
transformation, we just have to
determine what this matrix

53
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,000
is equal to, and that's just a
bunch of matrix operations.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,980
So that's A.

55
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,840
What is A transpose?

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:05,450
A transpose is going to be equal
to just all the rows

57
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,020
turn into columns.

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,960
So the first column becomes
the first row.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,165
So it becomes 1 0 0 1.

60
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:17,740
The second column becomes
the second row 0 1 0 1.

61
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,290
That's what A transpose is.

62
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,270
Now, what's A transpose A?

63
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,100
To figure out that, I want to
figure out what A transpose

64
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,680
times A is.

65
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,210
So let me multiply A
transpose times A.

66
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,370
So I'll rewrite A right here.

67
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,120
1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,290
This is giving us some
good practice on

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,890
matrix-matrix products.

70
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,590
This is going to be
equal to what?

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,660
Well, first of all, this is
a 2-by-4 matrix, and I'm

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,400
multiplying it by a 4-by-2
matrix, so it's going to be a

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,150
2-by-2 matrix.

74
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,410
So the first entry is
essentially the dot product of

75
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,870
that row with that column.

76
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:06,100
So it's 1 times 1 plus 0
times 0 plus 0 times 0

77
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,840
plus 1 times 1.

78
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,250
So it's just going to be 2 for
that first entry right there.

79
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,710
And then you take the dot
product of this guy with this

80
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,760
guy right here.

81
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,860
So it's 1 times 0, which is 0,
plus 0 times 1, which is 0,

82
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,090
plus 0 time 0, which is 0, plus
1 times 1, which is 1.

83
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,970
Now, we do this guy dotted with
this column right there.

84
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,170
0 times 1 is 0 plus 1 time 0 is
0 plus 0 times 0 is 0 plus

85
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,525
1 times 1 is 1.

86
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:44,200
   

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,740
And then finally,
this row dotted

88
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,640
with this second column.

89
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,430
Second row, second column.

90
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,660
0 times 0 is 0, 1 times 1
is 1, 0 times 0 is 0,

91
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,580
1 times 1 is 1.

92
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,530
So we have 1 times
1 plus 1 times 1.

93
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,450
It's going to be 2.

94
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,800
It's going to be equal to 2.

95
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,590
So this right here
is A transpose A.

96
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,520
But that's not good enough.

97
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,680
We need to figure out what the
inverse of A transpose A is.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,710
This is A transpose A.

99
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,720
But we need to figure out
A transpose A inverse.

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,300
So what's the inverse of this?

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,420
So let me write it here.

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:26,050
The inverse A transpose
A inverse is going

103
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:26,970
to be equal to what?

104
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,060
It's 1 over the determinant
of this guy.

105
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,185
What's the determinant here?

106
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:32,920
It's going to be 1 over the
determinant of this.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,510
The determinant is 2 times 2,
which is 4, minus 1 times 1.

108
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,910
So it's 4 minus 1, which is 3.

109
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:47,090
So 1 over the determinant times
this guy, where if I

110
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,170
swap these two, so I swap the
1's-- sorry, I swap the 2's.

111
00:05:53,170 --> 00:06:01,210
So this 2 goes here, and then
this orange 2 goes over here.

112
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,570
And then I make these
1's negative.

113
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,730
This becomes a minus 1 and
this becomes a minus 1.

114
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,010
We learned that this is a
general solution for the

115
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,510
inverse of a 2-by-2 matrix.

116
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,350
I think it was 10 or 11 videos
ago, and you probably learned

117
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,420
this in your Algebra II class,
frankly, but there you go.

118
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,420
We have A transpose A inverse.

119
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
So we have this guy.

120
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,020
We have this whole guy here
is just this matrix.

121
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,850
I could multiply the 1/3 into
it, but I don't have to do

122
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,930
that just yet.

123
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,670
But let's figure out the
whole matrix now.

124
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,700
The whole A times this
guy, A transpose A

125
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,340
inverse times A transpose.

126
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,350
Let me write it this way.

127
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:49,630
So the projection onto the
subspace V of x is going to be

128
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,880
equal to A.

129
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,020
   

130
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:02,270
1 0 0 1-- let me write a little
bit bigger like this.

131
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:11,680
So 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1 times A
transpose A inverse, right?

132
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,810
A times A transpose A inverse,
which is this guy right here.

133
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,370
Let's just put the 1/3 out
front just because

134
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,780
that's just a scalar.

135
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,570
I'll put the 1/3 out front
times this guy.

136
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,700
This A transpose A inverse
is 1/3 times 2

137
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,690
minus 1, minus 1, 2.

138
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,860
And then I'm going to multiply
it times A transpose.

139
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,200
   

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,180
And all that times
our vector x.

141
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,880
So A transpose is right there.

142
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,440
   

143
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,340
It is 1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

144
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,440
And then all of that's going
to be times your vector x.

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,070
So we still have some
nice matrix-matrix

146
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,070
products ahead of us.

147
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,290
Let see if we can do these.

148
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,160
So the first one, let's just
multiply these two guys.

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,680
   

150
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,210
I don't think there's any
simple way to do it.

151
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,370
This is a 2-by-2 matrix and this
is a 2-by-4 matrix, so

152
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,740
when I multiply them,
I'm going to end up

153
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,230
with a 2-by-4 matrix.

154
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,430
Let me write that 2-by-4
matrix right here.

155
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,080
And then I can write this
guy right here.

156
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,450
1 0 0 1, 0 1 0 1.

157
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,070
And then I have the 1/3 that
was from A transpose A

158
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,760
inverse, but I put the scaling
factor out there.

159
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,039
And all of this is equal to the
projection of x onto V.

160
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,040
So let's do this product.

161
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,690
So this first entry is going to
be 2 times 1 plus minus 1

162
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,930
times 0, so that is just 2.

163
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,250
Then you're going to have 2
times 0 plus minus 1 times 1.

164
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,895
Well, that's minus 1.

165
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:02,040
Then you have 2 times 0
plus minus 1 times 0.

166
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,110
Well, that's just 0.

167
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,010
And then you're going to
have 2 times 1 plus

168
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,420
minus 1 times 1.

169
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,350
That's 2 minus 1.

170
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,640
That's just 1, right?

171
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,790
2 times 1 plus minus
1 times 1.

172
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,430
Fair enough.

173
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,930
Now, let's do the second row.

174
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,730
Minus 1 times 1 plus 2 times
0, so that's just minus 1.

175
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,460
Minus 1 times 0 plus
2 times 1.

176
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,170
Well, that's just 2.

177
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,150
Minus 1 times 0 plus
2 times 0.

178
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,750
That's just 0.

179
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,640
Minus 1 times 1 plus
2 times 1.

180
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,020
Well, that's minus 1 plus
2, so that is 1.

181
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,560
Almost there, and, of course, we
have to multiply it times x

182
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,950
at the end.

183
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,350
That's what the transformation
is.

184
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,050
But this right here is our
transformation matrix.

185
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,390
One more left to do.

186
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,620
Let's hope I haven't made any
careless mistakes and that I

187
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,685
won't make any when doing
this product.

188
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,480
This is going to be a little
more complicated because this

189
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,350
is a 4 by 2 times a 2 by 4.

190
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,550
I'm going to end up with
a 4-by-4 matrix.

191
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,890
Let me give myself some
breathing room here because

192
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,260
I'm going to generate a 4-by-4
matrix right there.

193
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,820
And so what am I going to get?

194
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,690
So this first entry is going
to be 1 times 2 plus

195
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,060
0 times minus 1.

196
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,840
So it's just going
to be equal to 2.

197
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:29,100
The next entry: 1 times-- this
row times any column here is

198
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,560
just going to be the first entry
in the column because it

199
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,090
gets zeroed out.

200
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,600
So 1 times 2 plus 0 times
minus 1 is just 2.

201
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,500
1 times minus 1 plus 0 times
2 is just minus 1.

202
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,570
1 times 0 plus 0 times 0 is 0.

203
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,690
1 times 1 plus 0 times
1 is just 1.

204
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,920
When you take this row and you
multiply it times these

205
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,710
columns, you literally just
got your first row there.

206
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:58,100
Now, let's do this row
times these columns.

207
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,340
Now, you've got a 0 here, so
you're going to have a 0 times

208
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,010
the first entry of all
of these and a 1

209
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,820
times the second one.

210
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,800
So 0 times 2 plus 1 times
minus 1 is minus 1.

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,450
0 times minus 1 plus
1 times 2 is 2.

212
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,450
You're just going to get
the second row here.

213
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,110
2 0 1.

214
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,140
That actually makes sense,
because if you just look at

215
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,990
this part of the matrix, it's
the 2-by-2 identity matrix.

216
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,500
So, anyway, that's a little hint
why this looks very much

217
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,060
like that, but we're just
going to go through this

218
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,340
matrix product.

219
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,280
Now, you multiply this-- let me
do it in a different color.

220
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,530
You multiply this guy times
each of these columns.

221
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,440
That guy dotted with that is
just going to 0 because this

222
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,475
guy's essentially the 0 row
vector, so you're just going

223
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,330
to get a bunch of zeroes.

224
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,540
And then, finally, this last
row, it's 1 times the first

225
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,810
entry plus 1 times
the second entry.

226
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,920
So this guy's going to be 2
plus minus 1, which is 1.

227
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Minus 1 plus 2, which is 1.

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,160
0 plus 0, which is 0.

229
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,240
And then 1 plus 1, which is 2.

230
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,090
And all that times x.

231
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,710
And there you have it.

232
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,500
This is exciting!

233
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,220
The projection onto V of x
is equal to this whole

234
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,060
matrix times x.

235
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,770
So this thing right here, I
could multiply the 1/3 into

236
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,820
it, but we don't have
to do that.

237
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,870
That'll just make it a little
bit more messy.

238
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,720
This thing right here is the
transformation matrix.

239
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,270
   

240
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,760
As you can see, since we're
transforming-- remember, this

241
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,560
projection onto V,
this is a linear

242
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,540
transformation from R4 to R4.

243
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,610
You give me some member of R4,
and I'll give you another

244
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,600
member of R4 that's in my
subspace that is the

245
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
projection.

246
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,740
So this is going to be
a 4-by-4 You can

247
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,830
see it right there.

248
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,610
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that useful to actually see a

249
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,880
tangible result.

250
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,430
R4 is very abstract, so this
would even be beyond our

251
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,730
three-dimensional programming
example.

252
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,900
We're dealing with a more
abstract data set where we're

253
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,220
interested in finding
a projection.

254
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,066
