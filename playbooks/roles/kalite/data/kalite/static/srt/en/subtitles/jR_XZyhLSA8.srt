1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:02,433
At a very high level,

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:05,700
the period between 1915 and 1918

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,680
on the western front

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,300
is usually considered

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,967
to be a stalemate because

6
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,100
you did not have a major movement

7
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,259
on the front.

8
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,833
There were -some- movements

9
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:17,100
but the front pretty much looked the way

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,767
it looks in this diagram over here.

11
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:20,700
That's not to say

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,767
that it was not incredibly bloody;

13
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:23,833
in fact it was so bloody

14
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,358
that some of the most famous battles

15
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,773
not just in World War I history

16
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:28,934
but in -world- history

17
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,633
occurred during this period.

18
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:34,380
In particular they occurred in 1916.

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,309
The first of these happened in February

20
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,920
where you have the battle of Verdun.

21
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,567
You have the Germans

22
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,996
who want to do an offensive

23
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:50,033
on the French.

24
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:52,339
Most historians believe

25
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,500
it was not intended not necessarily

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,194
to gain this territory,

27
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:57,448
but to try to make the French

28
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,033
put so many troops here;

29
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,100
and they planned to inflict so many casualties

30
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,310
on the French that they might not be able

31
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,299
to overcome that

32
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,433
and that might throw the French out of the war.

33
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,036
They especially thought

34
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:09,367
this part of the front was vulnerable

35
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:10,869
because the French could be attacked

36
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,367
from multiple sides

37
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,980
at this little bulge over here.

38
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,380
And so in February 1916 they attacked,

39
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,690
primarily with artillery.

40
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,190
So they're shelling the French

41
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,900
in this whole area over here.

42
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,405
The French keep bringing troops into the mix

43
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:27,990
and to get a sense of how ugly

44
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,500
and how scary this whole scene was,

45
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,417
this is a quote from the journal

46
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,233
of a French soldier who's serving

47
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:37,340
in the battle of Verdun.

48
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,300
He was unfortunately later killed

49
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,767
due to artillery fire.

50
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:43,580
He wrote: "Humanity is mad."

51
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,210
"It must be mad to do what it is doing."

52
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,519
"What a massacre!"

53
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,196
"What scenes of horror and carnage!"

54
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,767
"I cannot find words..."

55
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,872
"... to translate my impressions."

56
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:56,700
"Hell can not be so terrible."

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,287
"Men are mad."

58
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,167
This battle would continue

59
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,700
through most of the year.

60
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,300
As you go into the summer,

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,597
that's the maximum of the German offensive.

62
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:07,980
This is some of the territory

63
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,160
that they are able to capture.

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,030
But as you get to the late summer,

65
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,410
in July of 1916,

66
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,233
the British and the French decide

67
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,410
to do an offensive on another part

68
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,562
of the front, near the Somme river.

69
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:21,930
So this right over here

70
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,014
is the Somme river.

71
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,449
And so you have --

72
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,759
This over here [Verdun] is a German offensive

73
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,589
and in July you have the battle of the Somme;

74
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,673
sometimes referred to as the Somme Offensive.

75
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:42,833
Named after the Somme river

76
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,964
as it occured where the Somme river

77
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,016
intersected with the front.

78
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,127
And this was a British and French

79
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,709
- Anglo-French -

80
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:53,892
offensive

81
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:55,426
And it's also famous --

82
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,825
Both of these were incredibly bloody,

83
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,439
that's what really made them noteworthy.

84
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,694
But this was also famous

85
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:01,040
for the first use of the tanks.

86
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,868
This is a picture of a British tank at the time.

87
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:05,849
But both of these were incredibly bloody.

88
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,749
It was lucky for the French at Verdun

89
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:13,080
that the offensive at the Somme happened

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,559
because this forced the Germans

91
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,295
to go off of the offensive

92
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,431
as we get into the late summer of 1916.

93
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,426
They had to bring troops back over here

94
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,374
to help support it.

95
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,960
But the end result of both of these

96
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,626
is that you do not have

97
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,892
a major movement of the front.

98
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,459
In fact, by the end of 1916,

99
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,759
because the Germans had to

100
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,390
go fight at the battle of the Somme,

101
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,380
the French were able to recapture

102
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,682
much of this territory.

103
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,121
So the real end result

104
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:40,700
of both of these offensives

105
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,954
- one on the German side

106
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,225
and one on the British side -

107
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:44,462
was just a massive, massive,

108
00:03:44,462 --> 00:03:46,649
massive loss of human life.

109
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:48,455
Each of them it's estimated had

110
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,453
on the order of a million casualties,

111
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,730
roughly half on each side.

112
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,378
At Verdun it was slightly more

113
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,825
on the French side than the German

114
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:57,465
but it was roughly 55/45%.

115
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:59,559
So a million casualties in Verdun

116
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,290
a million casualties on both sides at the Somme.

117
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,540
I've seen estimates on the death toll

118
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,938
being 1/3 of a million, 1/2 of a million

119
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,611
for each of these battles.

120
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,426
So both of these were incredibly

121
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,929
ugly battles for both sides.

122
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,559
The end result for the Germans though

123
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,226
was even more interesting

124
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,366
because you have to remember

125
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,037
what was happening at the Eastern Front.

126
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,058
On the eastern front

127
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,056
1916 was the year that the Russians

128
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:24,982
finally were building up their war machine;

129
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,561
they were finally able to equip

130
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,761
the munitions necessary.

131
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,027
It was also the year

132
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,369
that the Romanians joined

133
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,948
on the side of the Entente

134
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,945
along with the Russians on the eastern front.

135
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:37,240
The Austro-Hungarian were suffering huge losses

136
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,635
So in 1916 the Germans

137
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:40,400
were a very tough situation:

138
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,304
huge losses at Verdun,

139
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:44,719
huge losses at the battle of the Somme,

140
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,161
the Russians are starting to get

141
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,062
more aggressive on the eastern front,

142
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,384
the Austro-Hungarian are starting to have trouble,

143
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:54,260
so they decide to essentially re-trench.

144
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,492
They're going to start bringing more troops

145
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,025
back to the eastern front

146
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:02,020
but in order to not lose too much ground

147
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,009
at the western front

148
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,159
they try to hold a smaller front.

149
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:08,349
So they back up to this line;

150
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,424
they start preparing --

151
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,395
This is the line at the end

152
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,839
of the battle of the Somme.

153
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,760
The Germans recognize that they can't

154
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,625
protect this entire front;

155
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,092
they want to protect a shorter front

156
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:24,770
so they began preparing to move back over here

157
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,710
- and this line is named after the field marshal

158
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,109
of the German army

159
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:34,440
it's called the Hindenburg line.

160
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,486
Hindenburg.

161
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:39,516
It's no coincidence it's the same name

162
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:42,694
of the Zeppelin that blew up in the late 30's;

163
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:43,819
it was actually named after

164
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,892
field marshal Hindenburg

165
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,349
for whom this line is named. -

166
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,039
The Germans do this so they can take

167
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:53,425
more troops to the eastern front

168
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:55,292
and hold a shorter line;

169
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:56,931
so by the end of 1916 they start

170
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,360
making preparations for the Hindenburg line

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,550
and in February of 1917

172
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,359
they actually move there.

173
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,935
So this is 1917,

174
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,595
February,

175
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:16,669
the Germans moved to the Hindenburg line.

176
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,650
So: 1916, incredibly incredibly ugly year,

177
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,570
2 million casualties,

178
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,849
not a lot of movement of the actual front.
