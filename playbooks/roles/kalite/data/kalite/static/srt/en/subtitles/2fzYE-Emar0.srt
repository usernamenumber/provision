1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,100
We're now on problem number 4
from the Normal Distribution

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,710
chapter from ck12.org's
FlexBook on AP Statistics.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,380
You can go to their
site to download it.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,550
It's all for free.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,780
So problem number 4, and
it's, at least in my mind,

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,630
pretty good practice.

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,570
For normal or a standard normal
distribution, for a standard

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,000
normal distribution, place
the following in order from

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,420
the smallest to largest.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,840
So let's see, percentage of
data below 1, negative 1.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,165
OK, let's draw our standard
normal distribution.

13
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:34,370
So a standard normal
distribution is one where the

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,970
mean is-- sorry, I drew the
standard deviation-- is one

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,560
where the mean, mu for mean,
is where the mean is equal

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,640
to 0, and the standard
deviation is equal to 1.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,800
So let me draw that standard
normal distribution.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,440
So let me draw the
axis right like that.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,260
Let me see if I can draw a
nice-looking bell curve.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,920
There's a bell
curve right there.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,170
You get the idea.

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,520
And this is a standard normal
distribution, so the mean,

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,190
or you can kind of do the
center point right here.

24
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,380
It's not skewed.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,010
The mean is going to be
0 right there, and the

26
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,450
standard deviation is 1.

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,090
So if we go one standard
deviation to the right,

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,940
that is going to be 1.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,760
If you go two standard
deviations, it's going to be

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,680
2, three standard deviations
3, just like that.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,490
One standard deviation to the
left is going to be minus 1.

32
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,020
Two standard deviations to
the left will be minus 2,

33
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,260
and so on and so forth.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,690
Minus 3 will be three standard
deviations to the left because

35
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,660
the standard deviation is 1.

36
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,760
So let's see if we can
answer this question.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,410
So what's the percentage
of data below 1?

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,350
So the percentage-- Part a,
that's this stuff right here,

39
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,900
so everything below 1.

40
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,460
So it's all of-- well, not just
that little center portion.

41
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,500
It keeps going.

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,980
Everything below 1, right?

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,460
Percentage data below 1.

44
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,310
So this is another situation
where we should use

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,080
the empirical rule.

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,670
   

47
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,900
It never hurts to
get more practice.

48
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,730
Empirical rule.

49
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,360
Or maybe the better way to
remember the empirical rule is

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,240
just the 68, 95, 99.7 rule.

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,580
And I call that a better
way because it essentially

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,230
gives you the rule.

53
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,760
These are just the
numbers that you have to

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,080
essentially memorize.

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,930
If you have a calculator or a
normal distribution table,

56
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,800
you don't have to do this.

57
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
But sometimes in class,
people want you to estimate

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
percentages, and so
it's good to do.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,710
You know, you can impress
people if you can do

60
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,750
this in your head.

61
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,390
So let's see if we can use
the empirical rule to

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,420
answer this question.

63
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,980
The area under the bell curve
all the way up to 1, or

64
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,620
everything to the left of 1.

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,910
So the empirical rule tells us
that this middle area between

66
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,040
one standard deviation to
the left and one standard

67
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,190
deviation to the right,
that right there is 68%.

68
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,880
We saw that in the
previous video as well.

69
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
That's what the empirical
rule tells us.

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,420
Now of that 68%, we saw in the
last video that everything else

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,960
combined, it all has that up to
1 or to 100%, that this

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,210
left-hand tail-- let me draw it
a little bit-- this part right

73
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,450
here, plus this part right
here, has to add up-- when

74
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,110
you add it to 68-- has to
add up to 1 or to 100%.

75
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,100
So those two combined are 32%.

76
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,140
32 plus 68 is 100.

77
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,610
Now, this is symmetrical.

78
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,020
These two things are the exact
same, so if they add up to 32,

79
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,820
this right here is 16% and
this right here is 16%.

80
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,810
Now the question, they want us
to know the area of

81
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,380
everything-- let me do it in a
new color-- everything

82
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,780
less than 1, right?

83
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,240
The percentage of data below
1, so everything to the

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,530
left of this point.

85
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,440
So it's the 68%, it's right
there, so it's 68%, which is

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,780
this middle area within one
standard deviation, plus this

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,950
left branch right there.

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,800
So it's 68 plus 16%,
which is what?

89
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,480
That's equal to 84%.

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,810
So this Part a is 84%.

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,040
They're going to want us to
put this in order eventually,

92
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,220
but it's good to just solve
essentially the hard part.

93
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,900
Once we know the numbers,
ordering is pretty easy.

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,960
Part b.

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,050
The percentage of
data below minus 1.

96
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,360
So minus 1 is right there.

97
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,950
So they really just want us to
figure out this area right

98
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,980
here, the percentage of
data below minus 1.

99
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,280
Well, that's going to be 16%.

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,470
We just figured that out.

101
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,990
And you could have already
known, just without even

102
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,300
knowing the empirical, just
looking at a normal

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,920
distribution, that this entire
area, that Part b is a subset

104
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,850
of Part a, so it's going to
be a smaller number.

105
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,580
So if you just have to order
things, you could have made

106
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,840
that intuition, but it's good
to do practice with

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,330
the empirical rule.

108
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,040
Now, Part c, they want to
know what's the mean?

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,960
Well, that's the easiest thing.

110
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,590
The mean of a standard normal
distribution, by definition,

111
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,080
is 0, so number c is 0.

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,000
d, the standard deviation.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,700
Well, by definition, the
standard deviation for

114
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,410
the standard normal
distribution is 1.

115
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,860
So this is 1 right here.

116
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,710
This is easier than I
thought it would be.

117
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,470
Part e.

118
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,260
The percentage of data above 2.

119
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,010
So they want the percentage
of data above 2.

120
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,930
So we know from the 68, 95,
99.7 rule that if we want to

121
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,340
know how much data is within
two standard deviations-- so

122
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,490
let me do it in and new color.

123
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,595
So if we're looking from
this-- let me do it in

124
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,910
a more vibrant color.

125
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,480
Oh, green.

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,710
If we're looking from this
point to this point, so

127
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,430
it's within two standard
deviations, right?

128
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,650
The standard
deviation here is 1.

129
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,090
If we're looking within two
standard deviations, that whole

130
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,750
area right there by the
empirical rule is 95% within

131
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,430
two standard deviations.

132
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,590
This is 95%, which tells us
that everything else combined--

133
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,470
so if you take this yellow
portion right here and this

134
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,100
yellow portion right here, so
everything beyond two standard

135
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,310
deviations in either direction,
that has to be the remainder.

136
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,620
So, you know, everything in
the middle is 95 within two

137
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,680
standard deviations, so that
has to be 5% If you add that

138
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,010
tail and that tail together,
everything to the left and

139
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,990
right of two standard
deviations.

140
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,910
Well, I've made the
argument before.

141
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,060
Everything is symmetrical.

142
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,070
This and this are equal, so
this right here is 2 and a half

143
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,490
percent, and this right here
is also 2 and a half percent.

144
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,190
So they're asking us the
percentage of data above 2.

145
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,630
That's this tail, just
this tail right here.

146
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,900
The percentage of data more
than two standard deviations

147
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,515
away from the mean, so that's
2 and a half percent.

148
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:40,380
I'll do it in a darker colors
2 and a half percent.

149
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,000
Now, they're asking us, place
the following in order

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,070
from smallest to largest.

151
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,240
So there's a little bit of
ambiguity here, because if

152
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,180
they're saying the percentage
of data below 1, do they want

153
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,250
us to say, well, it's 84%.

154
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,950
So should we consider the
answer to Part a 84, or should

155
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,530
we consider-- if they said the
fraction of data below

156
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,550
1, I would say 0.84.

157
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,480
So it depends on how they
want to interpret it.

158
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,990
Same way here.

159
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,920
The percentage of data
below minus 1, I could

160
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,390
say the answer is 16.

161
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,320
16 is the percentage below
minus 1, but the actual number,

162
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,640
if I said the fraction of data
below minus 1, I would say

163
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,070
0.16, so this actually would be
very different in

164
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,990
how we order it.

165
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,670
Similarly, if someone asked me
the percentage, I would say,

166
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,520
oh, that's 2.5, but the
actual number is 0.025.

167
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,100
That's the actual fraction
or the actual decimal.

168
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,430
So, I mean, this is just
ordering numbers so I shouldn't

169
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,120
fixate on this too much.

170
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,730
But let's just say that they're
going with the decimal.

171
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,460
So if we wanted to do it that
way, if they wanted to do it

172
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,300
from smallest to largest, the
smallest number we have

173
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,190
here is c, right?

174
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,470
That's 0.

175
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,880
And then the next smallest
is e, which is 0.025.

176
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,370
Then the next smallest
is b, which is 0.16.

177
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,270
And then the next one after
that is a, which is 0.84, and

178
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,820
then the largest would be
the standard deviation d.

179
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,780
So the answers is cbad.

180
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,630
And obviously, the order would
be different if the answer to

181
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,870
this, instead of saying it is
0.084, you said it was 84,

182
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,950
because they're asking
for the percentage.

183
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,845
So a little bit of ambiguity.

184
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:11,880
If you had a question like this
on the exam, I would clarify

185
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,650
that with the teacher.

186
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,950
But hopefully, you
found this useful.

187
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,161
