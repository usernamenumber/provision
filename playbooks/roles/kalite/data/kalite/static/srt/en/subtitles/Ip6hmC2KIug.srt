1
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:07,462
We're in the British Museum and we are looking

2
00:00:07,462 --> 00:00:09,756
at some of the most famous sculptures

3
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:10,960
from all of the history,

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,085
in fact, perhaps the most famous sculptures.

5
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,979
This is the Pediment 's sculptures

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,521
from the East end of the Parthenon

7
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,201
on the Acropolis in Athens.

8
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:22,102
Created in the 5th century B.C. ,

9
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:26,239
which was the Classical period of Ancient Greece

10
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,614
The period when Athens is a Democracy

11
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,305
the "Golden Age".

12
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:35,572
And the Parthenon was its most important monument.

13
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,151
It was a treasury, in fact,

14
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:40,628
for the new Confederations, in Greece itself,

15
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:41,919
and so it was a symbol

16
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:44,180
of wealth, of power, of wisdom.

17
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,301
And, dedicated to the goddess Athena

18
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:51,872
who was the goddess of this city-state of Athens.

19
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:54,308
And the goddess of wisdom, and also war

20
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,223
- a warrior goddess -

21
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,358
The sculptures that we are looking at

22
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,394
from the East pediment

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,049
and, pediment is that triangular shape

24
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,714
on either end of an ancient greek temple.

25
00:01:05,714 --> 00:01:07,104
Yeah, really a gable

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,213
The figures had to be arranged -

27
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,074
it must had been a difficult composition

28
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,081
to fill an elongated triangle.

29
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,777
In fact the figures rise

30
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:16,396
and you can still see the triangle.

31
00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:17,751
The fact is, though, that

32
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,431
the middle figures are completely missing.

33
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:21,470
Let's give a quick overview of the narrative

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,918
Athena would be born

35
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:25,604
from the head of her father, Zeus, in the middle.

36
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,931
Then we have series of gods

37
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:28,943
and goddesses reacting to that.

38
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,614
The 3 figures that survived, on the right side

39
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:32,949
of the East Pediment

40
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,311
we think it might be Hestia

41
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,677
who would be closest to the middle,

42
00:01:36,677 --> 00:01:40,874
Aphrodite who is reclining on the lap of her mother.

43
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,210
And then to the right of Aphrodite,

44
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,181
we think that that would have been

45
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,022
the goddess of the Moon

46
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,234
leading a chariot to the Moon's setting

47
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,151
On the left side of the pediment

48
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,598
we have the opposite of that.

49
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:55,242
We have the Sun actually rising

50
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,677
and the god of the Sun actually bringing the Sun

51
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:00,673
on his chariot into the new day

52
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,095
representing, of course, the birth of Athena.

53
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,842
The thing that is most remarkable to me

54
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,809
is how life like, these are

55
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,983
and how filled with movement

56
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:12,208
Even though we don't have any heads

57
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,310
except for the one male reclining nude

58
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,912
- which is a severely damaged -

59
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:18,147
and is thought to probably be Dionysus.

60
00:02:18,147 --> 00:02:21,000
Even without the head, even without the hands

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,516
which are often the most expressive part of the body

62
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,413
And despite the fact the bodies themselves

63
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,520
are largely clothed,

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,406
the bodies are still incredibly expressive,

65
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:30,947
in terms of their energy,

66
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,619
in terms of their responsiveness

67
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,482
and in terms of their relationship to each other.

68
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:37,482
There is a kind of integration of the figures,

69
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:40,236
that's very complicated compositionally.

70
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,320
So the figure to the left of center

71
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,934
moves away but turns back,

72
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,461
and is interrelated to the figure next to her

73
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,533
who is seated, who is also reacting to her

74
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:53,070
and to the event in the center.

75
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,005
But then it is kind if more stabilized

76
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,940
by that frontal seated figure

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,326
just to the left.

78
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,623
And then the reclining nude

79
00:03:00,654 --> 00:03:02,101
who looks over to left.

80
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,824
So there is a real integration of the whole here,

81
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:06,767
that's very complex.

82
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,540
The thing that I find so interesting is

83
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,367
this psychological understanding

84
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:12,840
as well as this anatomical understanding

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,549
and simultaneously this respect for,

86
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:19,201
and love of the beauty of the body.

87
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:21,217
Now the women are clothed, but

88
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:23,802
the way that the artist is handling the drapery

89
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,071
in some ways actually defines

90
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:28,322
the turn of the muscles of the body.

91
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:30,468
In a sense of revealing more about the body

92
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:33,117
than the body would itself if it was nude

93
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,520
It is important to remember, I think,

94
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,162
something that we often forget

95
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,893
because we think about sculptures as white

96
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:42,050
which is that all of this would have been painted

97
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,572
in very bright colors

98
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,259
which would have seemed very strange,

99
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,975
almost garish to us today.

100
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,027
And probably really important

101
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:50,045
because, of course these would've been much higher

102
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:53,058
and much further away from the viewer than they are now.

103
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,664
But that paint would have helped viewers far below

104
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:57,398
to see details in the sculptures.

105
00:03:57,398 --> 00:03:58,933
But there is a kind of nobility

106
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,668
that is very much emblematic of

107
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,419
this high classical moment in Ancient Greece.

108
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,721
And if you look for instance at the figure

109
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,002
that we think is Dionysus.

110
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,902
I mean here is the god of wine, right?

111
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:09,483
who completely relaxed

112
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,614
and yet there is still this kind of nobility.

113
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:13,814
Yeah. There is still this kind of balance.

114
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:15,379
He's a god. Absolutely.

115
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,513
And we know it,

116
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,604
there is no doubt about it when we look at him.

117
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:21,527
He's divine. We're, we're on mount Olympus.

118
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:25,435
It's so easy to see why later cultures

119
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:28,308
later ages would look back to this kind of sculpture

120
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,011
and see this as kind of apex

121
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:33,075
as a kind of high point of human achievement.

122
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:35,939
You imagine an entire culture that is somehow

123
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,037
about perfection and transcendence, and beauty

124
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:42,276
and the heroic, and the noble.

125
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:45,807
It's like, the art so much embodies those values,

126
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,220
that one imagines them

127
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,207
in the ancient Athanians themselves.
