1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,881
Let's think a little bit about why credit default swaps are

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:12,597
famously referred to by Warren Buffet as FInancial Weapons of mass destruction

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,870
At the center of it, and there is not one Credit Default Swap writer

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,386
but I will put one in the middle because each of them are writing many many

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:24,113
Credit default swaps, AIG is the most famous, but you have some writer here

6
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,381
they are given some good credit rating.

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:31,299
May be in the past the credit rating was actually earned in the past by a credit rating agency.

8
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:34,207
And then frankly the credit rating agency got a litlte sloppy and really didn't

9
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:40,583
wasn't willing to downgrade them given all of them Credit default swaps all of the obligations they are taking on.

10
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:45,636
Credit Rating Agencies, as you could tell, I kind of view these guys and these guys as a main culprits

11
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:52,884
and may be a little bit of the regulatory agencies saying, Hey look these guys are writing insurance, may be we should actually regulate them.

12
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:58,638
But with that said, you have companies over here, I will do the companies in this pink color,

13
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:02,992
and they want to borrow money from the other parties.

14
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:08,135
Lets say investors, I will do the investors in this orange color, so the investors are lending them money

15
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:10,340
The companies gives them interest.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,563
So investors lending money, giving interest.

17
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,269
lending money, giving interest, lending money, giving interest.

18
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:21,039
And then these investors, and seems pretty reasonable, says hey look, there's this guy over here with a

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,402
double AA rating, the people we're lending to don't have a AA rating.

20
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:31,044
This guy has a B, may be this guy has a BB, may be this guy only has a singe A,

21
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:34,919
and so he says hey look, I want to be completely safe here so I am gonna pay a little bit of premium

22
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:39,205
to AIG, or to the writer, whoever the writer is

23
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:46,694
and in exchange I will get insurance. I will get insurance on, on this debt

24
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:50,768
I will get insurance

25
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:54,125
insurance. And it seems pretty reasonable

26
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,649
except for the fact that this player right over here

27
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:02,172
did not put out any money aside or did not put an appropriate amount of money aside

28
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:07,729
to properly account for all of these liabilities, all of these risks that is taking on

29
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,986
and also all of these risks are correlated.

30
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:13,656
You can imagine a situation where the economy goes bad. Now all of a sudden

31
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:19,669
this company defaults on its debt and this company defaults on its debt

32
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:24,739
In fact when the economy is good is likely that very few of these companies is going to default and when the economy goes bad

33
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,661
is likely that many of them will default.

34
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:33,035
But the real problem is that as soon as these defaults start happening then the credit default swap writer

35
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,784
is going to have to actually start paying for the defaults.

36
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,416
They will get the bad debt and in exchange they will make

37
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:44,874
the other side of the Credit default swap that the holder of it they will pay to make them hold.

38
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,629
And so this could take them out of business. And all of a sudden the people are over here

39
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:53,130
who are, who thought they had insurance no longer do and they might

40
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:00,516
actually say wait I can only hold AA debt and they might actually have to dump this debt on to the market.

41
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:05,397
Even worst you have all of the people, all of the people over here

42
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:08,614
who didn't lend any money over to any body but they really just wanted to make side bets

43
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:11,757
either the side bets might have been pure directional bets

44
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:15,178
on the state of the economy saying hey i think a bunch of companies or I think this company in particular

45
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:21,812
is going to default on its debt and they too could get credit default swaps really as just side bets.

46
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:26,132
So just for may be may be this right here is 1 billion dollars is in debt, may be

47
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:30,101
these all of these parties took side bets on this guy

48
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,920
So even though there is only a billion dollars of debt here, there might be

49
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,386
four or five or ten billion dollars worth of insurance on that 1 billion dollar bet.

50
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:45,056
So if all of a sudden this one company, can't pay it's 1 billion dollars, now AIG is on the line not for 1 billion

51
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:49,276
but for 4 or 5 or 6 billion, how ever much it insureded for

52
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:54,787
So it allows people to insure for things that they dont have the offsetting liability for.

53
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:59,647
And so you can imagine these guys, some of these people if these guy fails will just kind of take a loss

54
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:05,328
and that's bad and all of the rest they were expecting that they wouldn't. But some of these players might have had

55
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,121
offsetting hedges. The only reason that they might have felt comfortable

56
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:16,613
taking on some other liabilities is they said look If the economy goes really bad I have, I have this insurance over here

57
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,986
and they did that transaction with another third party.

58
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:24,525
Now all of a sudden if the economy goes bad and these guys said,

59
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,967
Hey look I am in a lot of trouble good thing I have this Credit default swap but then it

60
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:33,489
turns out that they don't because the counterparty here fails, the credit default swap writer and now all of sudden this guys becomes insolvent

61
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,904
but this guy was dependent on this guy paying and he thought

62
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:41,106
he was good because he was even looked into his books and thought that this guy had offsetting hedges

63
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:45,106
and now this guy might fail and so you can have this entire cascade through the entire financial system.
