1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,980
You hopefully have a little
intuition now on what a double

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,920
integral is or how we go about
figuring out the volume

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,490
under a surface.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,910
So let's actually compute it
and I think it'll all become

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,910
a lot more concrete.

7
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,220
So let's say I have the
surface, z, and it's a

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,530
function of x and y.

9
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,670
And it equals xy squared.

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,850
It's a surface in
three-dimensional space.

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,020
And I want to know the
volume between this

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,660
surface and the xy-plane.

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,320
And the domain in the xy-plane
that I care about is x is

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,380
greater than or equal to 0,
and less than or equal to 2.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,450
And y is greater than or
equal to 0, and less

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,740
than or equal to 1.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,370
Let's see what that looks
like just so we have a

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,960
good visualization of it.

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,260
So I graphed it here and
we can rotate it around.

20
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,750
This is z equals xy squared.

21
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,240
This is the bounding box,
right? x goes from 0 to

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,300
2; y goes from 0 to 1.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,720
We literally want this-- you
could almost view it the

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,710
volume-- well, not almost.

25
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,590
Exactly view it as the
volume under this surface.

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,530
Between this surface, the top
surface, and the xy-plane.

27
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,580
And I'll rotate it around so
you can get a little bit better

28
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,210
sense of the actual volume.

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,250
Let me rotate.

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,330
Now I should use the
mouse for this.

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,380
So it's this space,
underneath here.

32
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,975
It's like a makeshift
shelter or something.

33
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:27,060
I could rotate it a little bit.

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,340
Whatever's under this,
between the two surfaces--

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,920
that's the volume.

36
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,550
Whoops, I've flipped it.

37
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,500
There you go.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,690
So that's the volume
that we care about.

39
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,490
Let's figure out how to do and
we'll try to gather a little

40
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,480
bit of the intuition
as we go along.

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,850
So I'm going to draw a not as
impressive version of that

42
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,026
graph, but I think it'll
do the job for now.

43
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,185
Let me draw my axes.

44
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,710
   

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,030
That's my x-axis, that's my
y-axis, and that's my z-axis.

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,552
   

47
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:08,814
x, y, z.

48
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:10,870
x is going from 0 to 2.

49
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,300
Let's say that's 2.

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,160
y is going from 0 to 1.

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,796
So we're taking the volume
above this rectangle

52
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:23,570
in the xy-plane.

53
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,740
And then the surface, I'm going
to try my best to draw it.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,660
I'll draw it in a
different color.

55
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,680
I'm looking at the picture.

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,600
At this end it looks
something like this.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,300
   

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,743
And then it has a
straight line.

59
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:43,580
Let's see if I can draw this
surface going down like that.

60
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,176
And then if I was really
good I could shade it.

61
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:50,695
It looks something like this.

62
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:55,740
If I were to shade it,
the surface looks

63
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,020
something like that.

64
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,780
And this right here
is above this.

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,380
This is the bottom left corner,
you can almost view it.

66
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,700
So let me just say the yellow
is the top of the surface.

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,830
That's the top of the surface.

68
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,830
And then this is
under the surface.

69
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,260
So we care about this
volume underneath here.

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,840
Let me show you the
actual surface.

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,280
So this volume underneath here.

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,060
I think you get the idea.

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,560
So how do we do that?

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,590
Well, in the last example we
said, well, let's pick an

75
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,920
arbitrary y and for that
y, let's figure out the

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,250
area under the curve.

77
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,280
So if we fix some y-- when you
actually do the problem, you

78
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,550
don't have to think about it in
this much detail, but I want

79
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,410
to give you the intuition.

80
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,810
So if we pick just an
arbitrary y here.

81
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,250
So on that y, we could think of
it-- if we have a fixed y, then

82
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,480
the function of x and y you can
almost view it as a function

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,620
of just x for that given y.

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,610
And so, we're kind of figuring
out the value of this, of

85
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,470
the area under this curve.

86
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,430
   

87
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,820
You should view this as kind of
an up down curve for a given y.

88
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,870
So if we know a y we can figure
out then-- for example, if y

89
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,200
was 5, this function would
become z equals 25x.

90
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,570
And then that's easy to
figure out the value

91
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,350
of the curve under.

92
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,070
So we'll make the value under
the curve as a function of y.

93
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,500
We'll pretend like
it's just a constant.

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,770
So let's do that.

95
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,680
So if we have a dx
that's our change in x.

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,710
And then our height of each of
our rectangles is going to be a

97
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,010
function-- it's going to be z.

98
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,660
The height is z, which is
a function of x and y.

99
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,190
So we can take the integral.

100
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,020
So the area of each of these is
going to be our function, xy

101
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,760
squared-- I'll do it here
because I'll run out of space.

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,015
xy squared times the
width, which is dx.

103
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:05,710
And if we want the area of this
slice for a given y, we just

104
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,030
integrate along the x-axis.

105
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,095
We're going to integrate
from x is equal to 0

106
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:12,230
to x is equal to 2.

107
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,210
From x is equal to 0 to 2.

108
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,790
Fair enough.

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,050
Now, but we just don't want to
figure out the area under the

110
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,600
curve at one slice, for one
particular y, we want to

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,830
figure out the entire
area of the curve.

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,570
So what we do is
we say, OK, fine.

113
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,370
The area under the curve, not
the surface-- under this curve

114
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,050
for a particular y,
is this expression.

115
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,550
Well, what if I gave it
a little bit of depth?

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,540
If I multiplied this area times
dy then it would give me a

117
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,850
little bit of depth, right?

118
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,140
We'd kind of have a
three-dimensional slice of the

119
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,240
volume that we care about.

120
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,870
I know it's hard to imagine.

121
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,350
Let me bring that here.

122
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,560
So if I had a slice here, we
just figured out the area of a

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,400
slice and then I'm multiplying
it by dy to give it a

124
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,200
little bit of depth.

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,000
So you multiply it by dy to
give it a little bit of depth,

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,550
and then if we want the entire
volume under the curve we add

127
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,070
all the dy's together, take the
infinite sum of these

128
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,300
infinitely small
volumes really now.

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,450
And so we will integrate
from y is equal to 0

130
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,570
to y is equal to 1.

131
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,290
I know this graph is a little
hard to understand, but you

132
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,180
might want to re-watch
the first video.

133
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,540
I had a slightly easier
to understand surface.

134
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,590
So now, how do we
evaluate this?

135
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,510
Well, like we said,
you evaluate from the

136
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,500
inside and go outward.

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,480
   

138
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,510
It's taking a partial
derivative in reverse.

139
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,540
So we're integrating here with
respect to x, so we can treat

140
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,420
y just like a constant.

141
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,670
Like it's like the number
5 or something like that.

142
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,620
So it really doesn't
change the integral.

143
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,060
So what's the antiderivative
of xy squared?

144
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,160
Well, the antiderivative of
xy squared-- I want to make

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
sure I'm color consistent.

146
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,720
Well, the antiderivative
of x is x to the 1/2--

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,080
sorry. x squared over 2.

148
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,180
And then y squared is
just a constant, right?

149
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,580
And then we don't have to
worry about plus c since

150
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,960
this is a definite integral.

151
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,990
And we're going to
evaluate that at 2 and 0.

152
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,190
And then we still have
the outside integral

153
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,650
with respect to y.

154
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,190
So once we figure that out
we're going to integrate it

155
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,800
from 0 to 1 with respect to dy.

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,470
Now what does this evaluate?

157
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,912
We put a 2 in here.

158
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:36,276
If you put a 2 in there
you get 2 squared over 2.

159
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:39,230
   

160
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,740
That's just 4 over 2.

161
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,565
So it's 2 y squared.

162
00:07:43,565 --> 00:07:47,670
   

163
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,210
Minus 0 squared over
2 times y squared.

164
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,080
Well, that's just
going to be 0.

165
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,950
So it's minus 0.

166
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,220
I won't write that down because
hopefully that's a little

167
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,190
bit of second nature to you.

168
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,510
We just evaluated this
at the 2 endpoints and

169
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,660
I'm short for space.

170
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,710
So this evaluated at 2y
squared and now we evaluate

171
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,580
the outside integral.

172
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,910
0, 1 dy.

173
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,230
And this is an important
thing to realize.

174
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,120
When we evaluated this
inside integral, remember

175
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,820
what we were doing?

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,950
We were trying to figure out
for a given y, what the

177
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,180
area of this surface was.

178
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,070
Well, not this surface, the
area under the surface

179
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,380
for a given y.

180
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,190
For a given y that surface
kind of turns into a curve.

181
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,110
And we tried to figure out
the area under that curve

182
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,540
in the traditional sense.

183
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,870
This ended up being
a function of y.

184
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,500
And that makes sense because
depending on which y we pick

185
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,390
we're going to get a
different area here.

186
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,810
Obviously, depending on which y
we pick, the area-- kind of a

187
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,620
wall dropped straight down--
that area's going to change.

188
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,760
So we got a function of y when
we evaluated this and now we

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,330
just integrate with respect to
y and this is just plain old

190
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,810
vanilla definite integration.

191
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,350
What's the antiderivative
of 2y squared?

192
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:08,140
Well, that equals 2 times
y to the third over 3,

193
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,510
or 2/3 y to the third.

194
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,740
We're going to evaluate
that at 1 and 0, which

195
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,100
is equal to-- let's see.

196
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,480
1 to the third times 2/3.

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,870
That's 2/3.

198
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,460
Minus 0 to the third times 2/3.

199
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,580
Well, that's just 0.

200
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,270
So it equals 2/3.

201
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,620
If our units were meters
these would be 2/3 meters

202
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,230
cubed or cubic meters.

203
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,280
But there you go.

204
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,890
That's how you evaluate
a double integral.

205
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,450
There really isn't
a new skill here.

206
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,650
You just have to make sure to
keep track of the variables.

207
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,760
Treat them constant.

208
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,620
They need to be treated
constant, and then treat them

209
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,710
as a variable of integration
when it's appropriate.

210
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,090
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.

211
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,900
