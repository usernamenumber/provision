1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,735
What I wanna do in this video is kinda give a back-of-the-envelope way

2
00:00:05,735 --> 00:00:09,585
for thinking about a conundrum that the Khan academy is facing right now

3
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:12,866
and you could do a little bit more of a precise way with present valuing and all that

4
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:16,085
but this will give you a pretty good sense of how to make these decisions

5
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:18,182
so we're seriously looking at office space

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:20,248
I've changed these numbers to simplify things a little bit

7
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:26,262
but there's a nice office, and it's going for 2 thousand dollars per month

8
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:27,695
and then there's this dingy office

9
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,071
it's really too dingy to convert it into a night club

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,297
and it's really too dingy to be a respectable place to work

11
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,774
but it's going for 1000 dollars a month

12
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:38,754
and I talked to a contractor

13
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:40,645
and once again I'm simplifying these numbers

14
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:41,728
these numbers aren't the exact numbers

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,454
but it makes the math a little bit simpler

16
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:48,762
the contractor says it would cost us about ten thousand dollars

17
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:53,359
to get this dingy office to the condition of the nice office

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:00,674
and in either situation we are thinking about a 24 month lease

19
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:01,556
so 2 year lease

20
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,435
24 month lease

21
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:09,358
and the contractor said it would take 1 month of work

22
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,866
to get the dingy office space up to speed

23
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:15,838
so the nice office space landlord says

24
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:19,761
look, it'll be 24 month lease, you can just occupy it, it's ready to go

25
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:25,867
the dingy office space, I talked him about this idea of us investing money and repairing it

26
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,679
he's like, ok, if you need to repair it

27
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,767
you know, is not the easiest person to deal with

28
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,158
he says I'm going to charge you an extra month of rent

29
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:35,504
so even while I'm repairing it I have to pay rent

30
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:38,685
so then he'll say I'm willing to do a 25 month contract

31
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,146
a 25 month lease with you

32
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,888
so 25 months

33
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:44,559
so you could still, once you repair it

34
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:49,018
you still get 2 years of service from the dingy office

35
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,155
so which one should I do?

36
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,733
and I'll tell you, my emotions, I want to do the nice one

37
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,521
because I don't want to spend ten thousand dollars

38
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,914
and make this all nice

39
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:59,234
and then 2 years later the landlord could raise the rent

40
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,440
but let's just think about it rationally

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,857
which one makes sense?

42
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,552
and the easiest way to think about that is

43
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:06,804
what is the effective amount of rent

44
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:08,685
in a very back-of-the-envelope way

45
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,543
that we're paying for the dingy office?

46
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:14,165
so if you think about it over the course of the 24 months

47
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,581
that we're going to

48
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:18,019
well, if you think about it over the entire lease

49
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,874
we're gonna have 25 months, we're going to pay a thousand dollars per month

50
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:24,707
so it's gonna be 25 thousand dollars

51
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,865
plus 10 thousand dollars to repair it

52
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:30,117
so, plus 10 thousand dollars

53
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,555
I should write 10k like a did before

54
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:33,972
plus 10k

55
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,945
and in terms of the useful life

56
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,478
because over here when we say per month

57
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,010
every month here is useful

58
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,775
so how many useful months are here?

59
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:42,656
so we're gonna spend 1 month to repair

60
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:44,676
we only get 24 useful months

61
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:48,461
so we only get 24 useful months

62
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,061
so if you view it this way

63
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm not doing any fancy present valuing

64
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,080
just back-of-the-envelope

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:03,020
it is 35 thousand dollars over 24 months

66
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,109
so let's get our calculator out

67
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,199
I guess it's not pure back-of-the-envelope

68
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,961
but pretty close to pure back-of-the-envelope

69
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:18,832
35 thousand divided by 24 is equal to 1458

70
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:26,727
so this is equal to approximately 1458 dollars per month

71
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,024
so even though I don't wanna invest in this property

72
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,138
and I'm only going to be able to use it 2 years

73
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:34,901
and this person is gonna be able to raise the rent after that

74
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,571
it actually still makes a lot of sense

75
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,031
it still makes - actually almost 500 dollars a month of sense

76
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,772
or more than 500 dollars a month of sense

77
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,491
in this back-of-the-envelope way

78
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,813
to get the dingy office

79
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,136
and repair it
