1
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,133
We're going to look at some radiographs of the cervical spine of the neck and try to determine whether they're adequate or not.

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:20,733
What does it mean to be adequate? When you have an adequate view, you can see from the first

3
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:26,067
vertebrae all the way down to the junction of the seventh cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebrae.

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:30,667
I see. We call it adequate because it's adequate to make a diagnosis. That's right.

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:35,467
You want to see the entire cervical spine so that you can make sure that there is not an injury there.

6
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:44,333
So what are we looking at? What are we directly staring at here? We are looking at the lateral which shows

7
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:50,667
essentially part of the cervical spine. It shows cervical vertebra one through five. I see.

8
00:00:50,667 --> 00:01:00,267
Just to make myself clear, these are both lateral x-rays--meaning x-rays from the side of a person. That's right.

9
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:06,133
If I know my anatomy, this person is facing this way. They're actually facing the other way.

10
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, I can see, and there's a little jaw. Okay, I was just testing you. Good job.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,800
Alright, so the person is facing that way. This way is the front. And you were counting the different bones.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:28,000
Exactly. You were saying this is one, two, three, four, five. That's why you hear people with back

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,867
injuries saying they have problems in what do they call it? L5. Yes, exactly. Actually we count even

14
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:41,867
further forward from there, and we look at exactly at those things that kind of look like squares.

15
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:49,667
Those are the actual vertebra. Exactly, right there. Exactly. Although we're interested in the entire spine,

16
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:57,600
we kind of go down. You can see if you look at the fifth square there; below that it's really hard to

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,067
see the squares of six and seven. Right, we can't see anything below that. It looks like this person's

18
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:07,867
shoulder is blocking it. Exactly. You can see that that big white thing there is the person's shoulder

19
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:15,467
has gotten in the way. They shouldn't have worn those lead shoulder pads. (laughter). It's making

20
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:22,733
it hard to see if there's something going on down there. So how do you solve that? If you look over

21
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:32,267
at the other film, it's what we call a swimmer's view. We ask the patient to raise one arm and lower the other.

22
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:39,267
In doing so, you clear that lower cervical spine and allow better visualization of the entire

23
00:02:39,267 --> 00:02:44,933
spine. I see. And you're taking it from the direction of the raised arm. You take from the side.

24
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:52,733
And you can see . . . this is the raised arm here, and the other arm on the further side of the patient

25
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:59,867
is down. That allows us to get the should in position so that it doesn't block like this one does over here.

26
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:07,400
It's also clearer that this person is facing in this direction. (laughter) So let me see if

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,600
we can count. So this is number one. Yes, that's one. One, two, three, four, five, six, and there

28
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,133
we already got to six. We didn't see six over here, and then we've got seven. So you would call this

29
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,600
an adequate view of the neck because now we can look all the way through seven.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,733
Absolutely, we can get all the way down to seven. And ideally you want to see the top of one.

31
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:34,067
Actually, in this counting system we go one through seven. And then we start back at one again

32
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:40,267
because we're starting with the thoracic vertebra. Oh, it's like those streets where they start numbering

33
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:48,533
where it comes one again. Did I number that right? You did. Again, we're looking more to the

34
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:55,867
front. You've got your numbers perfectly on every spinous process. The little bump that you can feel

35
00:03:55,867 --> 00:04:00,800
when you press on the back of the neck. But we're really more interested in the alignment of the front

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,267
of the vertebral body. Okay, so this is one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. You want to look

37
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:11,867
at the top of one. If you just continue down right there, sometimes it's difficult to see.

38
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:17,667
But exactly you want to see if there's an alignment right in front. There's something right here that I cannot really see,

39
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:23,667
but you're an expert, so maybe you see things that I don't. (laughter) What do we so with

40
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:32,067
this. We've shown you that you can get a swimmer's view, and it can show you all the way down to c7 and t1.

41
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:36,400
But on the orginal view as you've shown, you can't see that. So what we did for this patient

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,333
was get a swimmer's view. I see, so it's adequate. We have this other slide right over here.

43
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:52,133
Why is this one interesting? This is the same patient, and now we've taken that same view that we talked about before.

44
00:04:52,133 --> 00:05:00,667
I mean the swimmer's view. This is the same patient as this patient right here, not this patient over on the right. That one looked pretty healthy. Exactly.

45
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:07,133
But here's an abnormal swimmer's view. The same person as this one, not the other one.

46
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:15,067
Facing in the same direction in case you want to test me. (chuckle) Okay, good. If you count again, starting with the first vertebra

47
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:30,133
One, two, three. Three's this one here. I see this whole things three right here. Four, five, six,

48
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:38,467
and then seven if I see that properly. (It's a little dark there.) Absolutely, the key important

49
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:45,067
finding there is that as you draw a line along the anterior (or the front) of all those vertebral bodies

50
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:54,800
if you were to connect them. Right. Just like that. I'll draw a dotted line. Fantastic. And as you

51
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,333
go down. Oh, look at that--seven as it looks like there's a little of a disruption there. Exactly,

52
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,267
and it's pushed back. And the problem is right behind those bones is your spinal cord. So, any kind

53
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:12,400
of injury like this can potentially injure your spinal cord and lead to permanent paralysis or weakness.

54
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,733
So this is the main thing. So there's two big takeaways from this short little segement: one is that you have

55
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:23,600
to make sure you have the information to make a diagnosis. For example, this over here you couldn't even

56
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,133
do something useful because you're not able to see the number six and number seven. Exactly, we'd call

57
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:32,733
it inadequate as you cannot draw any conclusions from that. That's why you would want them to get in

58
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:38,667
that swimmer's position, raise the arm from the direction you're looking at from the direction you're

59
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:43,667
looking at and lower the other arm. Correct. And then you can see something like this.

60
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:48,000
This right over here is cause for trouble because now you can go all the way to seven, and you can actually see

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,067
that they are not aligned. Absolutely, this is someone that you wouldn't let get out of your emergency

62
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:55,467
department without seeing a spine specialist whereas if you didn't have that view, you might falsely be

63
00:06:55,467 --> 99:59:59,999
reassured that everything was okay when in fact there's a serious problem. Wow, very cool. Very good. Thanks a bunch. Thank you.
