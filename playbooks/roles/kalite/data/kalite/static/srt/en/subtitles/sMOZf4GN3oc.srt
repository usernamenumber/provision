00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:08,348
The first well-known cipher – a substitution cipher –

2
00:00:08,348 --> 00:00:11,761
was used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC.

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,865
It is now referred to as the 'Caesar cipher.'

4
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:17,601
Caesar shifted each letter in his military commands

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,937
in order to make them appear meaningless

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,463
should the enemy intercept it.

7
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,180
Imagine Alice and Bob decided to communicate

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,819
using the Caesar cipher.

9
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,371
First, they would need to agree in advance

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,893
on a shift to use – say 3.

11
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:32,968
So to encrypt her message,

12
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:35,705
Alice would need to apply a shift of 3

13
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:38,272
to each letter in her original message,

14
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:41,090
So A becomes D – B becomes E –

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,224
C becomes F – and so on.

16
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:45,879
This unreadable – or 'encrypted' – message

17
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,225
is then sent to Bob openly.

18
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:54,676
Then Bob simply subtracts the shift of 3 from each letter,

19
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:58,497
in order to read the original message.

20
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:01,863
Incredibly, this basic cipher was used by military leaders

21
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,932
for hundreds of years after Caesar.

22
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:07,241
MOVIE DEPICTION OF CAESAR: "I have fought and won.

23
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:10,380
But I haven't conquered over man's spirit –

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,011
which is indomitable."

25
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,660
However, a lock is only as strong as its weakest point.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,954
A lock breaker may look for mechanical flaws –

27
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,415
or failing that, extract information –

28
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:25,143
in order to narrow down the correct combination.

29
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:26,870
The processes of lock breaking

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,446
and code breaking are very similar.

31
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,123
The weakness of the Caesar cipher

32
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,201
was published 800 years later

33
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,188
by an Arab mathematician named 'Al-Kindi.'

34
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,565
He broke the Caesar cipher by using a clue

35
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,372
based on an important property of

36
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:43,278
the language a message is written in.

37
00:01:43,278 --> 00:01:45,477
If you scan text from any book,

38
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,220
and count the frequency of each letter,

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,903
you will find a fairly consistent pattern.

40
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:53,626
For example, these are the letter frequencies of English.

41
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:56,908
This can be thought of as a fingerprint of English.

42
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,286
We leave this fingerprint when we communicate,

43
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,921
without realizing it.

44
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,109
This clue is one of the most valuable tools

45
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,481
for a code breaker.

46
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,993
To break this cipher, they count up the frequencies

47
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:11,288
of each letter in the encrypted text,

48
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,967
and check how far the fingerprint has shifted.

49
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,183
For example, if H is the most numerous letter

50
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:19,306
in the encrypted message, instead of E,

51
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,421
then the shift was likely 3.

52
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,949
So they reverse the shift

53
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,264
in order to reveal the original message.

54
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,014
This is called 'frequency analysis.'

55
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:33,223
And it was a blow to the security of the Caesar cipher.
