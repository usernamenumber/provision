1
00:00:00,744 --> 00:00:03,600
So I'm curious about how much acceleration

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
does a pilot, or the pilot and the plane,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,336
experience when they need to take off

4
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,854
from an aircraft carrier?

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:11,400
So I looked up a few statistics

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,166
on the Internet, this right here is

7
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:16,417
a picture of an F/A-18 Hornet right over here.

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:21,400
It has a take-off speed of 260 kilometers per hour.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,067
If we want that to be a velocity, 260 km/hour

10
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:27,330
in this direction, if it's taking off from

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,667
this Nimitz class carrier right over here.

12
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,867
And I also looked it up, and I found

13
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:34,867
the runway length, or I should say

14
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:36,467
the catapult length, because these planes

15
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,824
don't take off just with their own power.

16
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:40,658
They have their own thrusters going,

17
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,400
but they also are catapulted off,

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,164
so they can be really accelerated quickly

19
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,467
off of the flight deck of this carrier.

20
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,000
And the runway length of a Nimitz class carrier

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,084
is about 80 meters. So this is where

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,933
they take off from. This right over here

23
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,533
is where they take off from.

24
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,587
And then they come in and they land over here.

25
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,421
But I'm curious about the take-off.

26
00:00:58,421 --> 00:01:01,667
So to do this, let's figure out, well let's just

27
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,333
figure out the acceleration, and from that

28
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,933
we can also figure out how long it takes

29
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,400
them to be catapulted off the flight deck.

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,067
So, let me get the numbers in one place,

31
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,933
so the take-off velocity, I could say,

32
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:16,733
is 260 km/hour, so let me write this down.

33
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,414
So that has to be your final velocity

34
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,200
when you're getting off, of the plane,

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,757
if you want to be flying.

36
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:24,867
So your initial velocity is going to be 0,

37
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,667
and once again I'm going to use the convention

38
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:30,800
that the direction of the vector is implicit.

39
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,200
Positive means going in the direction of take-off,

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,749
negative would mean going the other way.

41
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:39,933
My initial velocity is 0, I'll denote it as a vector

42
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,886
right here. My final velocity over here

43
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:48,739
has to be 260 km/hour.

44
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:50,667
And I want to convert everything to meters

45
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,000
and seconds, just so that I can get my,

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,333
at least for meters, so that I can use my runway length

47
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,200
in meters. So let's just do it in meters per second,

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,000
I have a feeling it'll be a little bit easier

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,137
to understand when we talk about acceleration

50
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:04,067
in those units as well.

51
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,090
So if we want to convert this into seconds,

52
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,639
we have, we'll put hours in the numerator,

53
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,728
1 hour, so it cancels out with this hour,

54
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:14,857
is equal to 3600 seconds.

55
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:17,323
I'll just write 3600 s. And then

56
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:20,200
if we want to convert it to meters,

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,400
we have 1000 meters is equal to 1 km,

58
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,133
and this 1 km will cancel out with those kms

59
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,667
right over there.

60
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,000
And whenever you're doing any type of

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,667
this dimensional analysis, you really should see

62
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,318
whether it makes sense.

63
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:37,067
If I'm going 260 km in an hour,

64
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,078
I should go much fewer km in a second

65
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,402
because a second is so much shorter

66
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:43,074
amount of time, and that's why we're dividing

67
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:45,233
by 3600. If I can go a certain

68
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,400
number of km in an hour a second,

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,333
I should be able to go a lot,

70
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,867
many many more meters in that same amount

71
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,547
of time, and that's why we're multiplying

72
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,600
by 1000. When you multiply these out,

73
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,400
the hours cancel out, you have km canceling out,

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,800
and you have 260 times 1000

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,295
divided by 3600 meters per second.

76
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,733
So let me get my trusty TI-85 out,

77
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:12,052
and actually calculate that.

78
00:03:12,052 --> 00:03:26,754
So I have 260 times 1000 divided by 3600

79
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:29,467
gets me, I'll just round it to 72, because

80
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,133
that's about how many significant digits

81
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:34,645
I can assume here. 72 meters per second.

82
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:37,641
So all I did here is I converted the take-off velocity,

83
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:41,667
so this is 72 m/s, this has to be the final velocity

84
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,560
after accelerating. So let's think about

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,867
what that acceleration could be, given that we know

86
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,267
the length of the runway, and we're going to assume

87
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,667
constant acceleration here, just to simplify things

88
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,933
a little bit. But what does that

89
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,667
constant acceleration have to be?

90
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,890
So let's think a little bit about it.

91
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,630
The total displacement, I'll do that in purple,

92
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,467
the total displacement is going to be

93
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:07,966
equal to our average velocity while we're accelerating,

94
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:13,800
times the difference in time, or the amount of time

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,046
it takes us to accelerate.

96
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:19,467
Now, what is the average velocity here?

97
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,600
It's going to be our final velocity, plus our initial velocity,

98
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,144
over 2. It's just the average of the initial and final.

99
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:28,608
And we can only do that because we are dealing

100
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,733
with a constant acceleration.

101
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,133
And what is our change in time over here?

102
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,067
What is our change in time?

103
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,800
Well our change in time is how long does it take

104
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,133
us to get to that velocity? Or another way to think about it is:

105
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:45,884
it is our change in velocity divided by our acceleration.

106
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:50,505
If we're trying to get to 10 m/s, or we're trying to get

107
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:54,267
10 m/s faster, and we're accelerating at 2 m/s squared,

108
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,467
it'll take us 5 seconds.

109
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,610
Or if you want to see that explicitly written in a formula,

110
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,467
we know that acceleration is equal to

111
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,760
change in velocity over change in time.

112
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,267
You multiply both sides by change in time,

113
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,000
and you divide both sides by acceleration,

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
so let's do that, multiply both sides by change in time

115
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,259
and divide by acceleration.

116
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,200
Multiply by change in time and divide by acceleration.

117
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,267
And you get, that cancels out, and then you have

118
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,499
that cancels out, and you have change in time

119
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:29,667
is equal to change in velocity divided by acceleration.

120
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,800
Change in velocity divided by acceleration.

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,507
So what's the change in velocity?

122
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,733
Change in velocity, so this is going to be

123
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:41,357
change in velocity divided by acceleration.

124
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:42,867
Change in velocity is the same thing as your

125
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,133
final velocity minus your initial velocity,

126
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,467
all of that divided by acceleration.

127
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:52,267
So this delta t part we can re-write as

128
00:05:52,267 --> 00:06:00,867
our final velocity minus our initial velocity, over acceleration.

129
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:03,400
And just doing this simple little derivation here

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,459
actually gives us a pretty cool result!

131
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,872
If we just work through this math, and I'll try to

132
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:11,667
write a little bigger, I see my writing is getting smaller,

133
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,733
our displacement can be expressed as

134
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,954
the product of these two things.

135
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,626
And what's cool about this, well let me just

136
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:21,620
write it this way: so this is our final velocity

137
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:29,027
plus our initial velocity, times our final velocity

138
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:32,067
minus our initial velocity,

139
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:36,783
all of that over 2 times our acceleration.

140
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:40,733
Our assumed constant acceleration.

141
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,133
And you probably remember from algebra class

142
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,200
this takes the form: a plus b times a minus b.

143
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,800
And so this equal to -- and you can multiply it out

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,667
and you can review in our algebra playlist

145
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,801
how to multiply out two binomials like this,

146
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,933
but this numerator right over here,

147
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,027
I'll write it in blue, is going to be equal to

148
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:03,867
our final velocity squared minus our initial velocity squared.

149
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,272
This is a difference of squares, you can factor it out

150
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:10,267
into the sum of the two terms times the difference

151
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:13,067
of the two terms, so that when you multiply these two out

152
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:21,452
you just get that over there, over 2 times the acceleration.

153
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:24,667
Now what's really cool here is we were able to derive

154
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:27,267
a formula that just deals with the displacement,

155
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:31,600
our final velocity, our initial velocity, and the acceleration.

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,067
And we know all of those things except for the acceleration.

157
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:38,176
We know that our displacement is 80 meters.

158
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:40,521
We know that this is 80 meters.

159
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,774
We know that our final velocity, just before

160
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,267
we square it, we know that our final velocity is

161
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:50,133
72 meters per second. And we know that

162
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:53,362
our initial velocity is 0 meters per second.

163
00:07:53,362 --> 00:07:55,133
And so we can use all of this information

164
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,267
to solve for our acceleration.

165
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:02,267
And you might see this formula, displacement,

166
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,933
sometimes called distance, if you're just using

167
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:07,271
the scalar version, and really we are thinking only

168
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:08,757
in the scalar, we're thinking about the magnitudes

169
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,684
of all of these things for the sake of this video.

170
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,200
We're only dealing in one dimension.

171
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
But sometimes you'll see it written like this,

172
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,022
sometimes you'll multiply both sides times the 2 a,

173
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,800
and you'll get something like this, where you have

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,400
2 times, really the magnitude of the acceleration,

175
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,067
times the magnitude of the displacement,

176
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,133
which is the same thing as the distance,

177
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:31,600
is equal to the final velocity, the magnitude of

178
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:41,845
the final velocity, squared, minus the initial velocity squared.

179
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,733
Or sometimes, in some books, it'll be written as 2 a d

180
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,933
is equal to v f squared minus v i squared.

181
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,602
And it seems like a super mysterious thing,

182
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,600
but it's not that mysterious. We just very simply

183
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,268
derived it from displacement, or if you want to say distance,

184
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,847
if you're just thinking about the scalar quantity,

185
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:59,533
is equal to average velocity times the change in time.

186
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,023
So, so far we've just derived ourselves a kind of a

187
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:05,274
neat formula that is often not derived in

188
00:09:05,274 --> 00:09:07,267
physics class, but let's use it to actually

189
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,127
figure out the acceleration that a pilot experiences

190
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:14,267
when they're taking off of a Nimitz class carrier.

191
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:18,867
So we have 2 times the acceleration

192
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,467
times the distance, that's 80 meters,

193
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:25,267
times 80 meters, is going to be equal to

194
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:27,400
our final velocity squared.

195
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,421
What's our final velocity? 72 meters per second.

196
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:35,667
So 72 meters per second, squared,

197
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,867
minus our initial velocity.

198
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,467
So our initial velocity in this situation is just 0.

199
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,200
So it's just going to be minus 0 squared,

200
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,933
which is just going to be 0, so we don't even have to

201
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,838
write it down. And so to solve for acceleration,

202
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,578
to solve for acceleration, you just divide,

203
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:52,086
so this is the same thing as 160 meters,

204
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:55,667
well, let's just divide both sides by 2 times 80,

205
00:09:55,667 --> 00:10:03,708
so we get acceleration is equal to 72 m/s squared

206
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:11,361
over 2 times 80 meters.

207
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,267
And what we're gonna get is,

208
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,733
I'll just write this in one color,

209
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,867
it's going to be 72 divided by 160,

210
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,832
times, we have in the numerator,

211
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,400
meters squared over seconds squared,

212
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,173
we're squaring the units, and then we're

213
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,680
going to be dividing by meters.

214
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,533
So times, I'll do this in blue,

215
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,733
times one over meters. Right?

216
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,000
Because we have a meters in the denominator.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,341
And so what we're going to get is this

218
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,431
meters squared divided by meters,

219
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,940
that's going to cancel out, we're going to get

220
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,267
meters per second squared. Which is cool

221
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,841
because that's what acceleration should be in.

222
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,933
And so let's just get the calculator out,

223
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,766
to calculate this exact acceleration.

224
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:53,267
So we have to take, oh sorry, this is 72 squared,

225
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:57,600
let me write that down. So this is, this is going to be

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
72 squared, don't want to forget about this part

227
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,001
right over here. 72 squared divided by 160.

228
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:06,267
So we have, and we can just use the original number

229
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,867
right over here that we calculated,

230
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,845
so let's just square that, and then divide that by 160,

231
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:17,140
divided by 160. And if we go to 2 significant digits,

232
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:22,551
we get 33, we get our acceleration is, our acceleration

233
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:28,286
is equal to 33 meters per second squared.

234
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:31,800
And just to give you an idea of how much acceleration

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,467
that is, is if you are in free fall over Earth,

236
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:40,709
the force of gravity will be accelerating you,

237
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:46,630
so g is going to be equal to 9.8 meters per second squared.

238
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,400
So this is accelerating you 3 times more than what

239
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,667
Earth is making you accelerate if you were to

240
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,034
jump off of a cliff or something.

241
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:59,470
So another way to think about this is that the force,

242
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,800
and we haven't done a lot on force yet,

243
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,048
we'll talk about this in more depth,

244
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:05,533
is that this pilot would be experiencing

245
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,400
more than 3 times the force of gravity,

246
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,800
more than 3 g's. 3 g's would be about

247
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,533
30 meters per second squared, this is more than that.

248
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:19,625
So an analogy for how the pilot would feel

249
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,867
is when he's, you know, if this is the chair right here,

250
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,707
his pilot's chair, that he's in, so this is the chair,

251
00:12:26,707 --> 00:12:29,133
and he's sitting on the chair, let me do my best

252
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:32,733
to draw him sitting on the chair, so this is him

253
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:37,133
sitting on the chair, flying the plane, and this is the pilot,

254
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:41,000
the force he would feel, or while this thing is accelerating

255
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,401
him forward at 33 meters per second squared,

256
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:48,067
it would feel very much to him like if he was lying down

257
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:52,467
on the surface of the planet, but he was 3 times heavier,

258
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:56,475
or more than 3 times heavier. Or if he was lying down,

259
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,958
or if you were lying down, like this, let's say this is you,

260
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,667
this is your feet, and this is your face, this is your hands,

261
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,040
let me draw your hands right here, and if you had

262
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,475
essentially two more people stacked above you,

263
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:14,067
roughly, I'm just giving you the general sense of it,

264
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,467
that's how it would feel, a little bit more than two people,

265
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,733
that squeezing sensation. So his entire body

266
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,876
is going to feel 3 times heavier than it would

267
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,600
if he was just laying down on the beach or something

268
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,518
like that. So it's very very very interesting, I guess,

269
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,733
idea, at least to me. Now the other question

270
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:34,486
that we can ask ourselves is how long will it take

271
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:39,067
to get catapulted off of this carrier? And if he's

272
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:45,930
accelerating at 33 meters per second squared,

273
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,675
how long would it take him to get from 0

274
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,133
to 72 meters per second?

275
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,067
So after 1 second, he'll be going 33 meters per second,

276
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,533
after 2 seconds, he'll be going 66 meters per second,

277
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:58,800
so it's going to take, and so it's a little bit more

278
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,067
than 2 seconds. So it's going to take him

279
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,533
a little bit more than 2 seconds.

280
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,161
And we can calculate it exactly if you take

281
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:07,733
72 meters per second, and you divide it by 33,

282
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:13,600
it'll take him 2.18 seconds, roughly, to be catapulted

283
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,267
off of that carrier.
