1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,550
So, we have a parallelogram right over here

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,660
So, what we wanna prove is that it's diagonals bisect each other

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,040
So, the first thing we can think about; these aren't just diagonals,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,460
these are lines that are intersecting parallel lines

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,560
So, you can also view them as transversals

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,540
And if we focus on DB right over here, we see that it intersects DC

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,890
and AB and it sits there

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,640
Those we know are parallelograms

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,960
We know that they are parallel

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:25,990
This is a parallelogram

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,640
Alternate interior angles must be congruent

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,360
So, that angle must be equal to that angle there

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,670
Let me make a label here

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,030
Let me call that middle point E

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:42,630
So, we know that angle ABE must be congruent to angle CDE

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,130
by alternate interior angles of

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,130
a transversal intersecting parallel line

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,680
Alternate interior angles

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,840
If we look at diagonal AC or we should call it transversal AC

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,520
we can make the same argument

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,470
It intersects here and here

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,220
These two lines are parallel

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,360
So, alternate interior angles must congruent

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,740
So, angle DEC must be --- let me write this down ---

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,050
angle DEC must be congruent to angle BAE

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,150
by for the exact same reason

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,680
Now we have something interesting

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,580
If we look this top triangle over here and this bottom triangle,

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,820
we have one set of corresponding angles that are congruent

30
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,610
We have a side in between that's going to be congruent

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,220
Actually, let me write that down explicitly

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,380
We know and we've proved this to ourselves in the previous video

33
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,380
that parallelograms not only are opposite sides are parallel they're

34
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,540
also congruent

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,310
So, we know from the previous video that that side is equal

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,230
to that side

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,840
So, let me go back to what I was saying

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,760
We have two sets of corresponding angles that are congruent

39
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,710
We have a side in between that's congruent

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,740
And then we have another set of corresponding angles

41
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,770
that are congruent

42
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,150
So, we know that this triangle is congruent to that triangle

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,320
by angle-side-angle

44
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,960
So, we know that triangle --- I'm gonna go from the blue

45
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,460
to the orange to the last one

46
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,120
Triangle ABE is congruent to triangle blue, orange

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,970
and the last one, CDE by angle-side-angle congruency

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,940
Now what is that do for us

49
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,860
What we know if two triangles are congruent, all of their

50
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,370
corresponding features especially all of the corresponding

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,620
sides are congruent

52
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,740
So, we know that side EC corresponds to EA

53
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,920
Or I could say side AE, we could say side AE,

54
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,470
corresponds to side CE

55
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,830
They're corresponding sides of congruent triangle

56
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
So, their measures or their lengths must be the same

57
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,850
So, AE must be equal to CE

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,320
Let me put two slashes since I already used one slash over here

59
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:24,320
let me focus on this -- we know that BE must be equal to DE

60
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,450
Once again they're corresponding sides of two congruent triangles

61
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,870
so they must have the same length

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,320
So, this is corresponding sides of congruent triangles

63
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,000
So, BE is equal to DE

64
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,080
And we've done our proof

65
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,780
We've showed that, look, diagonal DB is splitting AC into two

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,230
segments of equal length and vice versa

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,780
AC is splitting DB into two segments of equal lengths

68
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,070
So, they are bisecting each other

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,640
Now, let's go the other way around

70
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,920
Let's prove to ourselves that if we have two diagonals

71
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,980
of a quadrilateral that are bisecting each other that we're

72
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,810
dealing with a parallelogram

73
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,020
So, let me see

74
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,010
So, we're gonna assume that the two diagonals

75
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,150
are bisecting each other

76
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,980
So, we're assuming that that is equal to that

77
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,360
And that that, right over there, is equal to that

78
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,290
Given that we wanna prove that this is a parallelogram

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,160
And to do that we just have to remind ourselves

80
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,000
We just have to remind ourselves that this angle is going

81
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,040
to be equal to that angle

82
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,730
One of the first things we learn because they're vertical angles

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,640
So, let me write this down

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:43,580
C -- label this point -- angle CED is going to be equal to

85
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:52,390
or is congruent to angle, so I started is BEA, angle BEA

86
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
And that, what is that, well that shows us that these

87
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,810
two triangles are congruent 'cause we have a corresponding sides

88
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,310
of a congruent and angle in between and on the other side

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,810
So, we now know that the triangle, I'll keep this in yellow,

90
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:20,300
triangle AEB is congruent to triangle DEC by side-angle-side

91
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:28,170
congruency, by SAS congruent triangles

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,160
Fair enough

93
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,760
Now, if we know that two triangles congruent we know that all

94
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,220
corresponding sides and angles are congruent

95
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:44,580
So, for example, we know that angle CDE is going to be congruent

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,360
to angle BAE

97
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:05,790
And this is just corresponding angles of congruent triangles

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,430
And now we have this kind of transversal of these two lines that

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,570
could be parallel if the alternate interior angles are congruent

100
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,990
And we see that they are

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,470
These two are kind of candidate alternate interior angles and

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,910
they are congruent

103
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,870
So, AB must be parallel to CD

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,780
So, AB, let's just draw one arrow, AB must be parallel to CD

105
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:42,620
by alternate interior angles congruent of parallel lines

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,110
I'm just writing in some short hand, forgive the cryptic nature

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,670
of it although I'm saying it out

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,300
And so we can then do the exact same -- while we just shown

109
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,230
that these two sides are parallel -- we can do that exact same

110
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,640
logic to show that these two sides are parallel

111
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,090
I won't necessarily write it all out

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,970
It's exact same proof to show that these two

113
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,680
So, first of all, we know that this angle is congruent to that angle

114
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,630
right over there

115
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,930
And then we know, actually let me write it out, we know

116
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:18,670
that angle AEC is congruent to angle DEB, I should say

117
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,360
They are vertical angles

118
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,060
And that is the reason up here as well

119
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,920
Vertical angles

120
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,260
And then we see that triangle AEC must be congruent

121
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,270
to triangle DEB by side-angle-side

122
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,010
So, then we have triangle AEC must be congruent to triangle

123
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,890
DEB by SAScongruency

124
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,730
Now, we know that corresponding angles must be congruent

125
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,680
So, that we know that angle, so, for example angle CAE

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:10,970
must be congruent to angle BDE and this is the corresponding

127
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,510
angles of congruent triangles

128
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,950
So, CAE, let me use a new color

129
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:25,940
CAE must be congruent to BDE

130
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,100
And now we have a transversal

131
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,100
The alternate interior angles are congruent

132
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,690
So, the two lines that the transversals are intersecting

133
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,130
must be parallel

134
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,230
So, this must be parallel to that

135
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,440
So, then we have AC must be parallel to BD

136
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,970
by alternate interior angles

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
And we're done

138
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,970
We've just proven that if the diagonals bisect each other,

139
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,910
if we start that as a given then we end at a point where we say,

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,860
"Hey, the opposite sides of this quadrilateral must be parallel

141
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,690
or that ABCD is a parallelogram "
