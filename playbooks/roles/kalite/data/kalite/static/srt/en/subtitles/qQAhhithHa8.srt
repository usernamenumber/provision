1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,140
Where we left off in the last
video, we were finding the

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,580
surface area of a torus,
or a doughnut shape.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,210
And we were doing it by
taking a surface integral.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,920
And in order to take a surface
integral, we had to find the

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,310
partial of our parameterization
with respect to s, and the

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,920
partial with respect to t, and
now we're ready to take

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,910
the cross product.

9
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,940
And then we can take the
magnitude of the cross product.

10
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,810
And then we can actually take
this double integral and

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,820
figure out the surface area.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,670
So let's just do
it step by step.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,360
Here we could take the cross
product, which is not

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,330
a non-hairy operation.

15
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,150
This is why you don't see many
surface integrals actually get

16
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,400
done, or many examples done.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,220
Let's take the cross product
of these two fellows.

18
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,560
So the partial of r with
respect to s, crossed with--

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,720
in magenta-- the partial
of r with respect to t.

20
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,610
This will be a little
bit of review of cross

21
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,390
products for you.

22
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,070
You might remember this
is going to be equal

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,660
to the determinant.

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,360
I'm going to write the
unit vectors up here.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,240
The first row is i, j, and k.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,630
And then the next 2 rows are
going to be-- let me do that in

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,760
that yellow color-- the next 2
rows are going to be the

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,460
components of these guys.

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,670
So let me copy and paste them.

30
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,740
You have that right there.

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,620
Copy and paste.

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,050
Put that guy right there.

33
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,930
Then you have this
fellow right there.

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,140
Copy and paste.

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,510
Put him right there.

36
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,130
And then you got this
guy right here.

37
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,350
This'll save us some time.

38
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,160
Copy and paste.

39
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,900
Put him right there.

40
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,440
Then the last row is going to
be this guy's components.

41
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,260
Copy and paste.

42
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,720
Put him right here.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,680
Almost done.

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,740
This guy-- copy and paste.

45
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,870
Put him right there.

46
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,890
Make sure we know that
these are separate terms.

47
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,280
And finally, we don't have to
copy and paste it, but just

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,430
since we did for all of the
other terms, I'll do it

49
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,490
for that 0, as well.

50
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,010
So the cross product of these
is literally the determinant

51
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,275
of this matrix right here.

52
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:11,350
   

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,600
And so, just as a bit of
a refresher of taking

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,490
determinants, this is going to
be i times the subdeterminant

55
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,700
right here, if you cross out
this column and that row.

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,350
So it's going to be equal to
i-- you're not used to seeing

57
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,770
the unit vector written first,
but we can switch the order

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,330
later-- times i times the
submatrix right here.

59
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,290
If you cross out this
column and that row.

60
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,370
So it's going to be this term
times 0-- which is just

61
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,490
0-- minus this term
times that term.

62
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,930
So minus this term times this
term- the negative signs are

63
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,520
going to cancel out, so
this'll be positive.

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,510
So it's just going to be i
times this term times this

65
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,240
term, without a negative
sign right there.

66
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,850
So i times this term,
which is a cosine of s.

67
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,630
It's really that term times
that term, minus that term

68
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,230
times that term, but the
negatives cancel out.

69
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,370
That times that is 0.

70
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,100
So that's how we can do this.

71
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:14,230
It's a cosine of s times b plus
a cosine of s-- I'll just all

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,140
switch to the same
color-- sine of t.

73
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,700
So we've got our i term
for the cross product.

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,190
Now it's going to be minus j--
remember when you take the

75
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,590
determinant, you actually have
this, kind of, you have to

76
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,060
checker board of
switching sines.

77
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,370
So now it's going to be minus j
times-- and you cross out that

78
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,390
row and that column-- and it's
going to be this term times

79
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,000
this term-- which is just
0-- minus this term

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160
times this term.

81
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,770
And once again, when
you have-- oh, sorry.

82
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,020
When you cross out this
column and that row.

83
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,750
So it's going to be that
guy times that guy, minus

84
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,230
this guy times this guy.

85
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,690
So it's going to be minus this
guy times this guy-- so it's

86
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,440
going to be-- let me
do it in yellow.

87
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,980
So the negative times negative
that guy, b plus a cosine of s

88
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,680
cosine of t times this
guy, a cosine of s.

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,210
   

90
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,574
We'll clean it up
in a little bit.

91
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:24,420
Well, we'll clean this up, and
you see this negative and that

92
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,500
negative will cancel out.

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,520
We're just multiplying
everything.

94
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,800
And then finally, the k term.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,470
So plus-- I'll go to the next
line-- plus k times-- cross out

96
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,800
that row, that column-- it's
going to be that times that,

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,340
minus that times that.

98
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,990
So that looks like a kind
of a beastly thing.

99
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,520
But I think if we take
it step by step, it

100
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,390
shouldn't be too bad.

101
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,300
So that times that.

102
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,255
The negatives are
going to cancel out.

103
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:56,270
So this term right here
is going to be a sine

104
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,770
of t, sine of s.

105
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,960
And then this term
right here is b plus a

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,375
cosine of s sine of t.

107
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,210
   

108
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,490
So that's that times that-- and
the negatives canceled out,

109
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,890
that's why I didn't put any
negatives here-- minus

110
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,370
this times this.

111
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,000
So this times this is going
to be a negative number.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,660
But if you take the negative
of it, it's going to

113
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,480
be a positive value.

114
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,470
So it's going to be plus
that a cosine of t

115
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,780
sine of s times that.

116
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,710
Times b plus a cosine
of s cosine of t.

117
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,850
Now you see why you don't see
many examples of surface

118
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,420
integrals being done.

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,070
Let's see if we can clean this
up a little bit, especially if

120
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,930
we can clean up this
last term a bit.

121
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,660
So let's see what we
can do to simplify it.

122
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,985
So our first term.

123
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:58,040
So let's just multiply
it out, I guess is the

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,510
easiest way to do it.

125
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,770
Actually, the easiest first
step would just be factor out

126
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,960
the b plus a cosine of s.

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
Because that's in every
term. b plus a cosine of s.

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,530
b plus a cosine of s.

129
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,480
b plus a cosine of s.
b plus a cosine of s.

130
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,710
So let's just factor that out.

131
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:20,310
So this whole crazy thing can
be written as b plus a cosine

132
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,370
of s-- so we factored
it out-- times--.

133
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,140
I'll put in some brackets
here, so you don't multiply

134
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,790
times every component.

135
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,125
So the i component, when you
factor this guy out, is going

136
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,310
to be a cosine of s sine of t.

137
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,480
Let me write it in green.

138
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:46,770
So it's going to be a cosine of
s sine of t times i-- you're

139
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,700
not used to seeing the i
before, so I'm going to write

140
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,290
the i here-- and then plus--.

141
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,170
We're factoring this guy out,
so you're just going to be

142
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,750
left with cosine of
t, a cosine of s.

143
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:06,350
Or we can write it as a cosine
of s cosine of t-- that's that

144
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,050
right there, just putting it in
the same order as that--

145
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,110
times the unit vector j.

146
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,590
And then when we factored this
guy out-- so we're not going

147
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,290
to see that or that anymore.

148
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,360
When you factor that out,
we can multiply this

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,990
out, and what do we get?

150
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,140
So in green, I'll write again.

151
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,220
So if you multiply sine of t
times this thing over here--

152
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,500
because that's all that we have
left after we factor out this

153
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:44,550
thing-- we get a sine of s,
sine squared of t, right?

154
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,360
We have sine of t
times sine of t.

155
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,250
   

156
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,910
So that's that over there.

157
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,460
Plus-- what do we
have over here?

158
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,520
We have a sine of s times
cosine squared of t.

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,000
   

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,450
And all of that times
the k unit vector.

161
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,510
   

162
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,310
And so things are looking a
little bit more simplified,

163
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,580
but you might see
something jump out at you.

164
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,700
You have a sine squared
and a cosine squared.

165
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,160
So somehow, if I can just make
that just sine squared plus

166
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
cosine squared of t, those
will simplify to 1.

167
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,580
And we can.

168
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,280
And this term right here, we
can-- if we just focus on that

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,220
term-- and this is all kind
of algebraic manipulation.

170
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,120
If we just focus on that term,
this term right here can be

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,170
rewritten as a sine of s-- if
we factor that out-- times sine

172
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:47,400
squared of t plus cosine
squared of t times

173
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,360
our unit vector, k.

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,590
Right?

175
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,480
I just factored out an a sine
of s from both of these terms.

176
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,360
And this is our most
fundamental trig identity

177
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,330
from the unit circle.

178
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,950
This is equal to 1.

179
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,110
So this last term simplifies
to a sine of s times k.

180
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,920
So, so far we've
gotten pretty far.

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,840
We were able to figure out the
cross product of these 2, I

182
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,445
guess, partial derivatives of
the vector valued,

183
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:16,710
or our original
parameterization there.

184
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,820
We were able to figure out what
this thing right here, before

185
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,070
we take the magnitude of it, it
translates to this

186
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,370
thing right here.

187
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,270
Let me rewrite it-- well, I
don't need to rewrite it.

188
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,780
You know it.

189
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,820
Well, I'll rewrite it.

190
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,393
So that's equal to-- I'll
rewrite it neatly and we'll use

191
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:38,000
this in the next video-- b plus
a cosine of s times open

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,810
bracket a cosine of s sine of t
times i plus-- switch back to

193
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:56,840
the blue-- plus a cosine of s
cosine of t times j plus--

194
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,900
switch back to the blue-- this
thing-- plus-- this simplified

195
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,870
nicely-- a sine of s times k.

196
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,315
Times the unit vector k.

197
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,000
   

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,020
This right here is this
expression right there.

199
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,740
And I'll finish this
video, since I'm already

200
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,970
over 10 minutes.

201
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,900
And in the next video,
we're going to take

202
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,180
the magnitude of it.

203
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,540
And then, if we have
time, actually take

204
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,470
this double integral.

205
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,470
And we'll all be done.

206
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,390
We'll figure out the surface
area of this torus.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,800
