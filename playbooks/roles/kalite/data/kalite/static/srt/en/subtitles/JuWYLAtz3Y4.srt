1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:01,938
In the last video

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:05,638
I talked about how bitcoin transactions are really incorporated

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:09,438
into a global and a publicly accessible ledger of sorts

4
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:12,281
that we call the transaction block chain.

5
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,380
This work is actually carried out by nodes in the Bitcoin network

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,410
that are known as bitcoin miners.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,234
There is a reward for all that effort,

8
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:26,577
especially since some of the computational heavy lifting is done by these bitcoin miners.

9
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:31,430
They are basically awarded a certain numer of bitcoins for their efforts.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,741
This happens by the miners effectively constructing

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,815
what is called a coinbase transaction.

12
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:41,303
They basically assign themselves bitcoins within that transaction.

13
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:48,487
In a sense, bitcoins are effectively generated almost out of thin air during this process.

14
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:52,278
Of course, if you see something like that, that may raise in your mind the question

15
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:56,470
of whether there is ever an upper limit to the Bitcoin money supply.

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,065
And fortunately the answer...

17
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,883
Maybe not so fortunately, depending on your viewpoint.

18
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:03,414
...the answer to that question is actually yes.

19
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:13,162
The Bitcoin system is actually designed so that there can be at most 21 mln bitcoins ever generated.

20
00:01:13,162 --> 00:01:18,951
That's the maximum numer of bitcoins that can ever come up in the system.

21
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:24,246
Beyond that point, no more new bitcoins will ever be accepted or generated or allowed to be generated.

22
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:28,565
As a result, nodes from that point onward,

23
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,935
once 21 mln bitcoins have been generated,

24
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:36,440
will no longer get a reward for complementing the transaction block chain.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,464
The bitcoin miners who do all this effort

26
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:42,735
are not gonna get guaranteed award for doing that effort.

27
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,477
And keep in mind, that because every transaction in the Bitcoin system is public

28
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:51,402
and the nodes in the system actually know how many coins have been generated

29
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,742
it's possible to really enforce this limits

30
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:57,342
on the total numer of bitcoins created.

31
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:00,422
There are two points I wanna make regarding this particular limit.

32
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:03,223
First of all, even after it is reached

33
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:07,675
we will still gonna need to do what bitcoin mining does today.

34
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:12,011
That involves things like incorporating transactions into transaction blocks

35
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:17,306
and incorporating these transaction blocks into transaction block chains and so on.

36
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:21,706
If you think about it, once the 21 mln coin limit is reached

37
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:25,642
these nodes don't get that automatic reward of bitcoins

38
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,647
for performing this extra effort.

39
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,307
You may be wondering what incentive is there for these nodes

40
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:34,242
to engage in this additional effort.

41
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,916
I mean, why are they doing this sort of thing

42
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:40,111
if they are not gonna get bitcoins as the guarantee for doing that work.

43
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:45,785
At this point the hope is that when we reach the 21 mln bitcoin limit

44
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:47,636
or as we get closer and closer to it,

45
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:51,301
the transaction fees will play a more prominent role

46
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:56,385
in a nodes decision to be a bitcoin mining node.

47
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:03,182
In particular, the idea here is that we hope the transaction fees will be enough of an incentive

48
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,384
and more and more people will

49
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:08,139
in general, I think hopefully at this point will be using bitcoins,

50
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,687
so as a result, I think there is an expectation or it's not unreasonable to think

51
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,366
that as more and more people use bitcoins

52
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,260
there will be more and more transactions

53
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,983
and as a result, more and more opportunity to make money out of the transaction fees.

54
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,789
It turns out that in the context of bitcoin mining

55
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,039
a lot of the heavy lifting is in this proof of work piece,

56
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,355
not in being able to incorporate all these transactions into a transaction block.

57
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:34,580
Even if there is a lot of transactions in a transaction block

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,291
it's not that much more effort for the miners to really incorporate those extra transactions.

59
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,275
If they are getting all these extra transaction fees

60
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:44,895
then that might be a good incentive for them.

61
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:51,360
It's also worth noting that transaction fees are actually set by the pair in Bitcoin.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,645
The pair is gonna have their honours of setting the fee appropriately,

63
00:03:57,645 --> 00:04:04,110
so that the nodes in the Bitcoin network are incentivised to add that pair's transactions

64
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,949
to their transaction blocks.

65
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,809
Hopefully, that makes some sense.

66
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:13,971
The second point I wanna make regarding this limit of 21 mln bitcoins

67
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:18,358
is that really Bitcoin does allow for fractional coins.

68
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,449
We haven't really talked much about that in this video

69
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:25,669
since I've really implicitly talked only about the idea of coins being these whole entities

70
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:27,713
like Alice transferring ten coins to Bob

71
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:29,511
or twenty five coins to Bob.

72
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:35,013
But it turns out you can actually have coins that are fractional.

73
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:40,615
In fact, the smallest possible unit in Bitcoin is a very small numer.

74
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:49,260
It's 0.00000001 bitcoins.

75
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,930
This is one hundred milionth of a bitcoin.

76
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,958
Just as an FYI, this is known as a Satoshi.

77
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:04,769
This name actually comes from the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

78
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,480
Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonim of the inventor of bitcoin.

79
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,338
Nobody actually is sure that there is somebody named Satoshi Nakamoto,

80
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:19,406
but as far as anybody can tell, the only person who's ever taken credit for the invention of bitcoin

81
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,490
is the Satoshi Nakamoto name.

82
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,564
It's unlikely there is actually a person behind that name

83
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:28,514
but it's more likely it's some kind of a group or something of that nature.

84
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,893
Aside from that, there are actually a couple of other additional controls that I wanna mention.

85
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:39,017
They are built in the Bitcoin for keeping the growth of that money supply in check.

86
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:42,627
First of all, the reward provided to bitcoin miners

87
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:46,071
actually decreases over time.

88
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:53,100
If you were aware, when Bitcoin began, which was around January of 2009,

89
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:01,488
at that time the reward for a bitcoin miner to do their effort was 50 bitcoins.

90
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,289
The way that the reward structure is set up

91
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,184
is that every 210,000 blocks,

92
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:10,859
so when you get to 210,000th block period,

93
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,610
when 210,000 new blocks are generated,

94
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,259
the reward size actually gets cut in half.

95
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,230
What that means is that once 210,000 blocks are generated

96
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,366
the reward goes from 50 bitcoins to 25 bitcoins,

97
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:29,301
then from 25 to 12.5 and so on and so forth.

98
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:37,310
It does take approximately four years to generate 210,000 blocks.

99
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,869
I'll talk a little bit later where this four years numbers come from.

100
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:45,753
Right now, when I'm recording this video it's May 2013,

101
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,941
the current award is actually no longer 50 bitcoins.

102
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,226
The current award now is 25 bitcoins per mining operation.

103
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:58,413
It's gonna go down by half in approximately four years

104
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:08,081
and that's just gonna keep happening until around the year 2140.

105
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:16,495
In 2140 we will expect that the entire bitcoin supply will have been generated.

106
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:20,522
So it is unlikely we will be generating bitcoins after 2140.

107
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:26,980
2140 is the point at which all bitcoins will have been generated.

108
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:35,193
The last way to limit the generation of bitcoins

109
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:41,633
is to actually calibrate the difficulty of solving that proof of work protocol at a global level.

110
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:45,713
I was gonna point out another functionality that Bitcoin has built into it

111
00:07:45,713 --> 00:07:53,035
is that for every 2,016 blocks that are generated

112
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:56,713
the network basically estimates the time that it took to generate those blocks.

113
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,783
It looks at how long did it take to generate the first of these block

114
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,927
and how lond did it take to generate the last of these blocks

115
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:04,709
and then measures that amount of time.

116
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,199
If that amount of time

117
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:16,983
is something significantly bigger than two weeks

118
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:22,571
then the proof of work protocol will be simplified.

119
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:26,268
It will be calibrated so that it's easier to generate the blocks.

120
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:32,903
On the flip side, let's say it took a lot less than two weeks to generate these 2,016 blocks.

121
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:38,137
In that case, the proof of work will be again calibrated to be made more difficult.

122
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:46,932
The goal is, we want it to be the case it takes about two weeks to generate 2,016 blocks.

123
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:52,743
About 14 days to generate 2,016 blocks.

124
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,143
To get a better sense for why that numer is the way it is

125
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:05,332
you could see that, let's say it takes about two weeks to generate 2,016 blocks.

126
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:08,936
What that actually will imply is that it takes about ten minutes

127
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,398
before the proof of work is actually solved

128
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:18,935
and a new transaction block is folded into the overall transaction block chain.

129
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:28,346
You can actually work out that if it took ten minutes to come up with one new block at the global level

130
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:32,960
and you multiply that by six to get the numer of blocks generated per hour,

131
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,934
so you get six blocks per hour,

132
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,882
or really six new proofs of work per hour,

133
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:40,515
which in turn would lead to six new transaction blocks per hour,

134
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:44,497
you multiply that by 24 hours per day

135
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:47,322
and you multiply that by 14 days

136
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:50,918
and you will find that when you multiply these things together

137
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:55,297
you will get the numer 2,016.

138
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:57,909
So, you can get the sense where this numer comes from.

139
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,731
I wanna make one last final claryfing remark regarding this proof of work.

140
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:09,710
Since solving the proof of work requires a bitcoin mining node to come up with the proof string,

141
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,970
which it currently does through some type of excessive search,

142
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,558
as you increase the numer of bitcoin mining nodes on a network,

143
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:21,444
the proof of work will be solved faster.

144
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,725
I don't mean faster for a particular node,

145
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,942
I mean faster at the level of the entire network.

146
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:31,532
In other words, it will take less time before at least one node comes up with the solution,

147
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,760
because these nodes are all working on same problem concurrently.

148
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:43,379
I also wanna mention quickly that even though different bitcoin mining nodes are all validating

149
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,741
either the exactly same set of transactions

150
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:50,551
or maybe largely overlapping set of transactions,

151
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:55,922
they are all solving entirely different proof of work protocols when they are doing this sort of thing.

152
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:02,532
The reason for that is that each node inserts its own coinbase or generational transaction

153
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:06,949
into the block that it's working on to award itself coins.

154
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:10,995
This generational or coinbase transaction is unique to each node.

155
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:15,999
As a result, the challenge string for which each bitcoin mining node

156
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:18,773
is seeking the corresponding proof of work

157
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:23,806
will be different for each bitcoin mining node.

158
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:28,478
Essentially, what you have is that because you have a cryptographic hash function being used in the process

159
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:32,542
just this one difference, the fact that just this one piece is different

160
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:37,235
completely randomizes the proof of work problem that results.

161
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:40,167
That makes it likely that across the entire network

162
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,407
the solutions are likely to be widely distributed

163
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,726
and we can expect that if we have enough nodes

164
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:49,611
one node will come up with the solution in about ten minutes.

165
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,570
At least one node will do it

166
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,518
and once one node comes up with the solution

167
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:58,164
everyone else can proceed from that point onward with the new chain.

168
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:02,692
As you can see, the Bitcoin protocol takes a numer of measures,

169
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:07,681
implements a numer of mechanisms to both limit the total numer of bitcoins

170
00:12:07,681 --> 00:12:12,810
as well as he ray in which these bitcoins are ultimately generated.
