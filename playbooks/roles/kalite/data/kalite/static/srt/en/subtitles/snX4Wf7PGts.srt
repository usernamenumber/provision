1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:02,849
So in a normal economy

2
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:09,435
We know that employment will drive overall demand

3
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:12,673
if we have high employment or low unemployment

4
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:14,216
then people are going to have more jobs

5
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,068
and they're going to have higher wages

6
00:00:16,068 --> 00:00:17,339
and that will have higher demand

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,409
or if the other way goes around

8
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,162
if they lose their jobs

9
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,039
demand is going to go down

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,610
wages will start to go down

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,128
and people aren't going to have money in their pockets.

12
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:26,456
So that employment drives demand,

13
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:28,419
and we can view demand

14
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,952
and I'm making a huge simplification here

15
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:33,970
demand will drive production

16
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,603
or maybe we can think of it as supply

17
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,803
it will drive supply

18
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:42,608
and it can also be a driver of price.

19
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:43,678
And of course

20
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:46,573
there is a little bit of a negative feedback loop

21
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,038
for both of these things

22
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:50,972
if the demand is high, the price goes high

23
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:52,838
that might produce a little bit of negative feedback

24
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,188
on the demand

25
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,078
this type of a sort of an arrow, this line here

26
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:57,296
means negative feedback

27
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:59,029
or I'll put a little negative sign here

28
00:00:59,029 --> 00:01:00,745
and let's say the demand is high

29
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:02,430
then the supply goes high

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,599
well that might also make the demand

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,238
actually the supply going high

32
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:10,256
would drive the price going down

33
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,421
so maybe I should draw a negative feedback like here.

34
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:16,340
High supply would mean lower price

35
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,683
but that's not what I want to focus on in the video.

36
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,714
And we could keep adding more lines here

37
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,997
but this is a roughly simple take on it

38
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:26,618
but the general idea is supply and price

39
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:29,916
will then drive corporate profits,

40
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,552
or just profits in general

41
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:33,668
even for an individual business owner

42
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:39,050
and then profits are going to drive employment

43
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,717
Now, let's imagine a scenario

44
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:42,335
we are in a bad economy

45
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,002
maybe a depression-like economy.

46
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,501
So that situation you could start really at any point in the circle

47
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:49,189
I'll just start at employment

48
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,984
So let's say employment is really low

49
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:54,666
that's going to make demand really low,

50
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,440
and if demand is really low

51
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,866
then supply is going to go down

52
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:59,557
and price is going to go down

53
00:01:59,557 --> 00:02:01,706
and then that's going to make profits go down

54
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,564
and that's going to make employment even lower.

55
00:02:04,564 --> 00:02:06,031
and so what we find ourselves

56
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:09,663
in this kind of recessionary or depressionary environment

57
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:17,469
this would be called a deflationary spiral

58
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:18,447
and it's a spiral

59
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:20,852
because a bad economy is driving lower prices

60
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,447
which is in turn driving a bad economy

61
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:24,619
and to make matters worse

62
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,144
if this continues long enough

63
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,814
or if these price declines are severe enough

64
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,505
you could imagine people saying

65
00:02:29,505 --> 00:02:31,853
"Look, I have this dollar in my pocket

66
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:33,553
I'm not going to spend this dollar

67
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,282
because one, I might lose my job at any moment

68
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,806
or, and I know that dollar is becoming more powerful

69
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:43,025
I can buy more every minute that I wait."

70
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,591
So as the price goes down

71
00:02:44,591 --> 00:02:46,483
so as all of this scary stuff happens

72
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,060
so the employment is going down

73
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,632
profits are going down

74
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,259
price is going down

75
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,976
this makes people not hoard goods and services the way

76
00:02:53,976 --> 00:02:55,435
or at least hoard goods the way

77
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,636
that they would do in an inflationary spiral

78
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:02,699
but it makes them hoard money.

79
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,168
And why it's ultra scary

80
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,881
for central bankers or for governments

81
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,768
is they start to not have as much control over the economy.

82
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,700
They can't just run the printing press

83
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,149
and try to stimulate the economy in this situation

84
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,358
because if they did

85
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:15,848
people are so conservative right now

86
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:16,877
you can imagine maybe

87
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:19,630
depression is going on for years and years and years

88
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,013
and let's say they take some type of a helicopter

89
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,046
and this isn't how you actually distribute money

90
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,279
to the money supply

91
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,681
but it's just to show an extreme example

92
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,065
so they take a helicopter

93
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,830
and they start dumping cash on people

94
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,214
they print cash, and they start dumping it on people

95
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,763
so every man and woman and child in the country

96
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:37,614
gets a $10 bill

97
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:40,481
Well, if people are really scared, they're really afraid

98
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,125
they're just gonna take that $10 bill

99
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,238
and stuff it under their mattress

100
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,533
and it's not going to change anything

101
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,436
the dollar isn't going to actually enter into the money supply

102
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,698
the velocity on it will be zero.
