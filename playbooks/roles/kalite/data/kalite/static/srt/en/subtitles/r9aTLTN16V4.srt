1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,250
In the last video, we stumbled
upon a way to figure out the

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,940
inverse for an invertible
matrix.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,090
So, let's actually use
that method in

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,310
this video right here.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm going to use the same matrix
that we started off

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,820
with in the last video.

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,860
It seems like a fairly
good matrix.

9
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,360
We know that it's reduced row
echelon form is the identity

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,890
matrix, so we know
it's invertable.

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,800
So, let's find its inverse.

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,040
The technique is pretty
straightforward.

13
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,700
You literally just apply the
same transformations you would

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,220
apply to this guy to get you
to the identity matrix, and

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,170
you would apply those same
transformations to the

16
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,370
identity matrix.

17
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,440
That's because the collection
of those transformations, if

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,240
you represent them as matrixes,
are really just the

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,820
inverse of this guy.

20
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,480
Let's just do it.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,280
So I'll create an augmented
matrix here.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,420
Maybe I'll do it right here.

23
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,800
Let me make it a little
bit neater.

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,940
First, I'll write A.

25
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,490
It's 1, minus 1, 1.

26
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,310
And then minus 1, 2, 1.

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,340
Minus 1, 3, 4.

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,180
And then I'll augment it with
the identity matrix, with 1,

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,040
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,600
Now, if I want to get a into
reduced row echelon form,

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,480
maybe I'll replace
the second row.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,280
I'll keep the first row
the same for now.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,100
Let me just draw it like this.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,000
The entire first row:
1, minus 1, minus 1.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,680
It's going to be augmented
with 1, 0, 0.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,630
Keep the whole first
row the same.

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,960
Let's replace the second
row with the second row

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,230
plus the first row.

39
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,220
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,830
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

41
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,950
3 plus minus 1 is 2.

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,570
0 plus 1 is 0.

43
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,660
1 plus-- oh, sorry.

44
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,780
That was a tricky one.

45
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,520
0 plus 1 is 1.

46
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,050
1 plus 0 is 1.

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,170
0 plus 0 is 0.

48
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,290
All I did is I added
these two rows up.

49
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,450
Now, this third row.

50
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,190
Let me replace-- I want
to get a zero here.

51
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,220
Let me replace the third
row with the third row

52
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,730
minus the first row.

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,080
1 minus 1 is 0.

54
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,930
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

55
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,850
4 minus minus 1 is 5.

56
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,260
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,270
0 minus 0 is 0.

58
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,110
And then 1 minus 0 is 1.

59
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,880
Just like that.

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,300
Now, what do we want to do?

61
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,750
Well, we've gotten this far.

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,170
We want to zero out that
guy and that guy.

63
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,760
Let's keep our second
row the same.

64
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Let me write it down here.

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,840
   

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,410
It's 0, 1, 2, and then you
augmented it with 1, 1, 0.

67
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,680
Just like that.

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,900
And let's replace my first row
with the first row plus the

69
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,590
second row.

70
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,880
1 plus 0 is 1.

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,890
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

72
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,980
That's why I did that,
to get a zero there.

73
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,050
Minus 1 plus 2 is 1.

74
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,970
1 plus 1 is 2.

75
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,150
0 plus 1 is 1.

76
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,160
0 plus 0 is 0.

77
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,730
And now, I also want to zero
out this guy right here.

78
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,770
Let's replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

79
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,000
times the second row.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,010
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

82
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:43,340
5 minus 2 times 2 is 5
minus 4, that's 1.

83
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,820
Minus 1 minus 2 times 1--
that's minus 1 minus

84
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,570
2-- is minus 3.

85
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,660
0 minus 2 times 1,
that's minus 2.

86
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,030
And then, 1 minus 2 times
0 is just 1 again.

87
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,250
All right, home stretch.

88
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,070
Now, I just want to zero out
these guys right here.

89
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,685
All right, so just let me keep
my third row the same.

90
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:10,736
Let me switch colors, keep
things colorful.

91
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:13,330
   

92
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,589
It's 0, 0, 1.

93
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:21,490
We're going to augment it with
minus 3, minus 2, and 1.

94
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:27,370
Now, let's replace our first row
with the first row minus

95
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,980
the third row.

96
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,210
1 minus 0 is 1.

97
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,600
0 minus 0 is 0.

98
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,730
1 minus 1 is 0.

99
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,220
2 minus minus 3, that's 5.

100
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,310
1 minus minus 2 is 3.

101
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,530
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

102
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,100
Now, let's replace the second
row with the second row minus

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,610
2 times the third row.

104
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,310
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,930
1 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

106
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,060
2 minus 2 times 1 is-- I'm
sorry, I just-- oh, whoops.

107
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,200
Let me-- we have to be very
careful not to make any

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,090
careless mistakes.

109
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,370
0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

110
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,490
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

111
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,960
It's not 0.

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,690
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

113
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,730
1 minus 2 times minus
3-- that is 1 plus 2

114
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,780
times 3-- that is 7.

115
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,010
1 minus 2 times minus 2, that's
1 plus 4, which is 5.

116
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,780
And then, 0 minus 2 times
1, so that's minus 2.

117
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,710
And just like that, we've
gotten the A part of our

118
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,980
augmented matrix into reduced
row echelon form.

119
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,020
This is the reduced row
echelon form of A.

120
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,830
And when you apply those exact
same transformations-- because

121
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,020
if you think about it, that
series of matrix products that

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,420
got you from this to the
identity matrix-- that, by

123
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,230
definition, is the
identity matrix.

124
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,210
So you apply those same
transformations to the

125
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,730
identity matrix, you're going
to get the inverse of A.

126
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,030
This right here is A inverse.

127
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,650
And we have solved for the
inverse, and it actually

128
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,010
wasn't too painful.
