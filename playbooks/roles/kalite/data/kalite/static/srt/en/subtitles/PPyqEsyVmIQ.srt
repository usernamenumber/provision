2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
It's a hot day in Rome, but you know,

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
the ancient Romans had figured out how to stay cool.

4
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
We're in a room that reconstructs a room in the villa of Livia.

5
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:03,382
Livia was the wife of the emperor Augustus.

6
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:04,418
There is a lovely summer house, a resort of sorts,

7
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:04,918
And in the villa, there was one room

8
00:00:04,918 --> 00:00:05,418
that was partially undergrond, dug into the rock,

9
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:05,918
which meant they would stay much cooler in summer.

10
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:06,449
And we can really appreciate that today!

11
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:06,949
But the sense of coolness would come not only

12
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:07,572
from the actual temperature, but also

13
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:08,072
from the decoration. From the very cool colours that this room is painted in.

14
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:08,572
What the artist did was paint an amazing illusion

15
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:10,973
of a landscape, a garden, as though the walls

16
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:11,795
were not walls at all, but views out

17
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:57,067
beyond the fence, beyond the wall.

18
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:01,533
There's trees, and bushes, and fruits, and plants, and birds

19
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,167
It's as if the walls have dissolved and

20
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:08,700
this is a great example of the second style of Roman wall painting

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,433
The first style was characterised by an attempt to re-create

22
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:20,433
in paint and stucco, the marble walls stuff of decorated Greek palaces

23
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,233
A kind of faux marble or kind of trompe-l'oeil.

24
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,567
Exactly. Now here, instead of the illusion of marble,

25
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,100
the artist has created an illusion of nature.

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,400
And nature is spread out all around us

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,433
and it's not a menacing nature it's a beautiful cultivated nature

28
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,933
It's full of playful birds,

29
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,800
there is fruit in the trees,

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
there are blossoms everywhere,

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,210
and there is light! The artist used atmospheric perspective

32
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,867
so that the trees and leaves that are closest

33
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,567
are surrendered more crisply than the vegetation in the background.

34
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:55,933
The only real architecture that's represented is,

35
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,120
as you mentioned, a straw fence perhaps

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,275
or something that looks a bit more substantial

37
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,718
in a kind of pink gray.

38
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,700
The artist has used that outer wall

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,400
in order to create a subtle rendering of perspective.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,333
You can see that as the wall reaches out in a couple of places

41
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,700
to enclose trees that are just on the border.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,000
We see poppies, roses, irises, pomegranates, quince,

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,433
so there is a real sense of variety in the plants,

44
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:29,433
and the flowers, in the fruits and in the birds that we see.

45
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:34,267
The positions of the birds: some with their wings stretched back, some sitting quietly

46
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:39,300
some in the sky... There is a real search for the variety of nature.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,667
My favorite part is this one tree, that is framed

48
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,967
by this pinkish gray wall.

49
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,800
The branches move in exactly the haphazard way that a tree grows,

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,333
and there are places where we see light on the leaves and branches

51
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:58,267
and other places where the leaves are in shadow

52
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:01,000
It seems as if actually there is a breeze that's come up

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,033
and it has blown some leaves over so we seeing more silvery underside

54
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:09,709
and we get the darker shadows of the tops of the leaves.

55
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,467
So there is a real sense of the momentary and

56
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,900
of this being a breezy, beautiful day.

57
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,533
You can almost hear the leaves rustling in the wind.

58
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:22,167
I think my favorite plant is probably the acanthus that grows up around a pine

59
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,967
on one of the short sides of the room.

60
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:28,267
The other element I find most interesting is

61
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:32,933
that in this open-air space there is perched precariously

62
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:36,433
on that outer wall, a bird cage.

63
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:40,733
Throughout this entire room, there are paintings of birds that are free

64
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,733
and flying through the open sky

65
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,667
but here, we have a bird in a cage,

66
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:52,333
which reminds me that as I stand in this room, although these walls have dissolved, I am still inside a room.

67
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:58,433
