1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,430
What number sets does
the number 3.4028

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,330
repeating belong to?

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,150
And before even answering the
question, let's just think

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,690
about what this represents.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,000
And especially what this
line on top means.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,770
So this line on top means
that the 28 just

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,420
keep repeating forever.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:25,090
So I could express this number
as 3.4028, but the 28 just

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,110
keep repeating.

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,740
Just keep repeating on and
on and on forever.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,299
I could just keep writing
them forever and ever.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,210
And obviously, it's just easier
to write this line over

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,620
the 28 to say that it
repeats forever.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,290
Now let's think about what
number sets it belongs to.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,600
Well, the broadest number set
we've dealt with so far is the

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,330
real numbers.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,420
And this definitely belongs
to the real numbers.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,300
The real numbers is essentially
the entire number

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,990
line that we're used to using.

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,660
And 3.4028 repeating sits
someplace over here.

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:01,340
If this is negative 1, this
is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,730
3.4028 is a little bit more
than 3.4, a little

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,490
bit less than 3.41.

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,760
It would sit right over there.

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,450
So it definitely sits
on the number line.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,090
It's a real number.

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,870
So it definitely is real.

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,370
It definitely is
a real number.

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,080
But the not so obvious question
is whether it is a

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,180
rational number.

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,040
Remember, a rational number is
one that can be expressed as a

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,890
rational expression
or as a fraction.

34
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:34,390
If I were to tell you that p is
rational, that means that p

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,840
can be expressed as the
ratio of two integers.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,620
That means that p can be
expressed as the ratio of two

37
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,900
integers, m/n.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,960
So the question is, can I
express this as the ratio of

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,410
two integers?

40
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,410
Or another way to think
of it, can I

41
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,990
express this as a fraction?

42
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,510
And to do that, let's actually
express it as a fraction.

43
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,310
Let's define x as being
equal to this number.

44
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:09,960
So x is equal to 3.4028
repeating.

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,650
Let's think about
what 10,000x is.

46
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,470
And the only reason why I want
10,000x is because I want to

47
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,960
move the decimal point all the
way to the right over here.

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,710
So 10,000x.

49
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,380
What is that going
to be equal to?

50
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,350
Well every time you multiply
by a power of 10, you shift

51
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,420
the decimal one to the right.

52
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,790
10,000 is 10 to the
fourth power.

53
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,780
So it's like shifting
the decimal over to

54
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,830
the right four spaces.

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,400
1, 2, 3, 4.

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,575
So it'll be 34,028.

57
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,700
But these 28's just
keep repeating.

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,820
So you'll still have the 28's
go on and on, and on and on,

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,720
and on after that.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,550
They just all got shifted to the
left of the decimal point

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,430
by five spaces.

62
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,070
You can view it that way.

63
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,140
That makes sense.

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,670
It's nearly 3 and 1/2.

65
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,810
If you multiply by 10,000,
you get almost 35,000.

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,490
So that's 10,000x.

67
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,970
Now, let's also think
about 100x.

68
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,340
And my whole exercise here is
I want to get two numbers

69
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,590
that, when I subtract them and
they're in terms of x, the

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,130
repeating part disappears.

71
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,970
And then we can just treat them
as traditional numbers.

72
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,260
So let's think about
what 100x is.

73
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,530
100x.

74
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,010
That moves this decimal point.

75
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,370
Remember, the decimal point
was here originally.

76
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,860
It moves it over to the
right two spaces.

77
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,830
So 100x would be 300-- Let
me write it like this.

78
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,750
It would be 340.28 repeating.

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,220
We could have put the 28
repeating here, but it

80
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,010
wouldn't have made
as much sense.

81
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,670
You always want to write it
after the decimal point.

82
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,340
So we have to write 28 again to
show that it is repeating.

83
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,710
Now something interesting
is going on.

84
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,400
These two numbers, they're
just multiples of x.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,790
And if I subtract the bottom one
from the top one, what's

86
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,710
going to happen?

87
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,530
Well the repeating part
is going to disappear.

88
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,170
So let's do that.

89
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,280
Let's do that on both sides
of this equation.

90
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,230
Let's do it.

91
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,210
So on the left-hand side of this
equation, 10,000x minus

92
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,620
100x is going to be 9,900x.

93
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,960
And on the right-hand side,
let's see-- The decimal part

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,230
will cancel out.

95
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,030
And we just have to figure out
what 34,028 minus 340 is.

96
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,120
So let's just figure this out.

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,010
8 is larger than 0, so we
won't have to do any

98
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,649
regrouping there.

99
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,769
2 is less than 4.

100
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,200
So we will have to do some
regrouping, but we can't

101
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,510
borrow yet because we
have a 0 over there.

102
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,710
And 0 is less than 3, so we
have to do some regrouping

103
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,000
there or some borrowing.

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,770
So let's borrow from
the 4 first.

105
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,590
So if we borrow from the 4, this
becomes a 3 and then this

106
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,140
becomes a 10.

107
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,460
And then the 2 can now
borrow from the 10.

108
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,090
This becomes a 9 and
this becomes a 12.

109
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,820
And now we can do
the subtraction.

110
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,390
8 minus 0 is 8.

111
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,110
12 minus 4 is 8.

112
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,880
9 minus 3 is 6.

113
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,920
3 minus nothing is 3.

114
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,950
3 minus nothing is 3.

115
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:05,320
So 9,900x is equal to 33,688.

116
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,180
We just subtracted 340
from this up here.

117
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,110
So we get 33,688.

118
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,710
Now, if we want to solve
for x, we just divide

119
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,610
both sides by 9,900.

120
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,990
Divide the left by 9,900.

121
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,900
Divide the right by 9,900.

122
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,000
And then, what are
we left with?

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,850
We're left with x is equal
to 33,688 over 9,900.

124
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,550
Now what's the big
deal about this?

125
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,900
Well, x was this number. x was
this number that we started

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,580
off with, this number that
just kept on repeating.

127
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,500
And by doing a little bit of
algebraic manipulation and

128
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,660
subtracting one multiple of it
from another, we're able to

129
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,530
express that same exact
x as a fraction.

130
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,780
Now this isn't in simplest
terms. I mean they're both

131
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,900
definitely divisible by 2
and it looks like by 4.

132
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,960
So you could put this in lowest
common form, but we

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,910
don't care about that.

134
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,055
All we care about is the fact
that we were able to represent

135
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,050
x, we were able to represent
this number, as a fraction.

136
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,620
As the ratio of two integers.

137
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,720
So the number is
also rational.

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,550
It is also rational.

139
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,010
And this technique we
did, it doesn't only

140
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,700
apply to this number.

141
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,370
Any time you have a number that
has repeating digits, you

142
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,000
could do this.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,530
So in general, repeating
digits are rational.

144
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,090
The ones that are irrational are
the ones that never, ever,

145
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,860
ever repeat, like pi.

146
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,590
And so the other things, I think
it's pretty obvious,

147
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,810
this isn't an integer.

148
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,410
The integers are the
whole numbers that

149
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,020
we're dealing with.

150
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,390
So this is someplace in
between the integers.

151
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,360
It's not a natural number or a
whole number, which depending

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,240
on the context are viewed
as subsets of integers.

153
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
So it's definitely
none of those.

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,110
So it is real and
it is rational.

155
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,460
That's all we can
say about it.
