1
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:08,200
We're in the Brithish Museum in London,

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,360
in a room that is filled with ancient Egiptian mummies,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,565
and as a result it's also filled with modern children.

4
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:18,779
And tourist. It's a great room, there's great stuff here.

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,672
We're looking at a fragment of a scroll

6
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:22,876
which is largely ignored.

7
00:00:22,968 --> 00:00:24,101
It's a papyrus scroll.

8
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:27,390
A papyrus is a reed that grows in the Nile Delta

9
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:29,806
that was made into a kind of paper-like substance

10
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:34,003
and actually was probably the sigle most important surface for writing

11
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,578
right up into the Medieval.

12
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:40,305
We're looking at a written text of something that we call the Book of the Dead

13
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:43,021
which the ancient Egyptians had other names for,

14
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,864
but which was a ancient text

15
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:48,063
that had spell and prayers and incantations,

16
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:50,275
things that the dead needed in the afterlife.

17
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:53,411
This is a tradition that goes all the way back to the Old Kingdom,

18
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:56,444
writing that we call pyramid text.

19
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,065
These were sense of instructions for the afterlife,

20
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:03,195
and than later we have coffin text, writing on coffins

21
00:01:03,195 --> 00:01:05,566
and then even later in the New Kingdom,

22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,675
we have scrolls like this that we call the books of the dead.

23
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,803
Sometimes the texts were written on papyrus,

24
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:11,943
like the one we are looking at,

25
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:13,996
sometimes they were written on shrouds

26
00:01:13,996 --> 00:01:15,410
that the dead were burried in.

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:22,102
So these were really important texts that were originally just for kings in the Old Kingdom,

28
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:26,697
but came to be used by people who were not just part of the royal family, but

29
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:30,432
still people of high rank, and that's what we're looking at here.

30
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:35,308
This text was found in the tomb of someone named Hunefer, a scribe.

31
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,395
A scribe had a priestly status,

32
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,608
so we are dealing here with somebody who was literate,

33
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:43,198
who occupied a very high station in Egyptian culture.

34
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:46,473
And we actually see representations of a man who had died,

35
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,522
who was burried with this text

36
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:52,783
and if you look on the left edge of the scroll at the top,

37
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:55,471
you can see a crouching figure in white,

38
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:59,973
Hunefer, who is speaking to a line of crouching deities,

39
00:01:59,973 --> 00:02:02,665
gods prophesing the good life that he lived

40
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,846
that he's earned a place in the afterlife.

41
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:08,172
Well, what we have below is a scene of judgement

42
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,747
whether Hunefer has lived a good life

43
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:13,566
and deserves to live into the afterlife,

44
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:17,676
and we see Hunefer again, this time standing on the far left

45
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:21,115
and we can recognize him beacause he's wearing the same white robe

46
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:26,297
and he's being led by the hand by a god with a jackal head, Anubis,

47
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:27,972
a good that is asscociated

48
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:31,774
with the dead, with mumification, with cemeteries

49
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,357
and he's carrying in his left hand and ankh,

50
00:02:34,357 --> 00:02:38,829
a symbol of eternal life, and that's exactly what Hunefer is after.

51
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,108
If we continue to move toward the right,

52
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:44,308
we see that jackal-headed god again, Anubis, this time crouching

53
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:49,279
and adjusting a scale, making sure that it is exactly balanced.

54
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:52,473
On the left side, we see the heart of the dead

55
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:56,532
so the heart is on one side of the scale, on the other side there's a feather.

56
00:02:56,532 --> 00:03:02,034
The feather belongs to Ma'at that we also see at the very top of the scale,

57
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,506
and we can see a feather coming out of her head.

58
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:08,872
Now, Ma'at is a deity associated with divine order,

59
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,578
with living an ethical, ordered life.

60
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:15,962
And in this case, the feather is lower, the feather is heavier.

61
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:20,972
Hunfer has lived an ethical life, and therefore is brought into the afterlife.

62
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:26,945
So he won't be devoured by that evil-looking beast next to Anubis.

63
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:33,695
That's Ammit who has the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion and a hind-quarters of a hippopotamus.

64
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:39,695
He's waiting to devour Hunefer's heart, should he be found to have not lived an ethical life,

65
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,671
not lived according to Ma'at.

66
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:47,470
The Egyptians belived that only if you lived the ethical life, only if you pass this test,

67
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,203
would you be able to have access to the afterlife. It's not like the Christian conception

68
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,936
where you have an afterlife for everybody,

69
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,007
no matter if they were blessed or sinful

70
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,508
that is you either go to Heaven or you go to Hell.

71
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,913
Here you only go to the afterlife if you have been found to be ethical.

72
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,078
The next figure that we see is another deity,

73
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,403
this time with the head of an ibis, of a bird.

74
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:16,150
This is Thoth who is reporting the proceedings of what happens to Hunefer,

75
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,806
and in this case reporting that he has succeeded and will move on to the afterlife.

76
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:25,858
I love the representation of Thoth. He is so upright, and his arm is stretched out,

77
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:30,318
rendered in such a way that we trust him that he's gonna get this right.

78
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:35,307
Next we see Hunefer yet again, this time being introduced to

79
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:40,306
one of the supreme gods in the Egyptian pantheon, Osiris.

80
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:43,998
And he's being introduced to Osiris by Osiris' son, Horus.

81
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,673
Horus is easy to remember,

82
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:49,472
cause Horus is associated with a falcon, and here has a falcon's head.

83
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:55,650
Horus is the son of Osiris and holds in his left hand an ankh which we saw earlier,

84
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,525
and again that's a symbol of eternal life.

85
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:02,252
He is introducing him to Osiris as you said, who is in this

86
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:06,127
fabulous enclosure, speaks to the importance of this deity.

87
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:13,746
He's enthroned, he carries symbols of Egypt, and he sits behind a lotus blossom, a symbol eternal life

88
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:20,963
and on top of that lotus blossom, Horus' four children who represent the four cardinal points:

89
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,996
North, South, East and West.

90
00:05:22,996 --> 00:05:27,534
The children of Horus are responsible for carrying for the internal organs

91
00:05:27,534 --> 00:05:29,848
that would be placed in Canopic jars,

92
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:33,567
so they have a critical responsibility for keeping the dead preserved.

93
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,701
We see Horus again, but symbolized as an eye.

94
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,066
Now remember, Horus is represented as a falcon, as a bird,

95
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:45,211
and so here even though he's the symbol of the eye, he has talons instead of hands,

96
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,576
and those carry an ostrich feather, also a symbol of eternal life.

97
00:05:49,623 --> 00:05:53,702
The representation of the eye of Horus has to do with another ancient Egyptian myth,

98
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,702
the battle between Horus and Seth, but that's another story.

99
00:05:56,702 --> 00:06:01,196
Now, behind Osiris we see two smaller standing female figures,

100
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:06,351
one of whom is Isis, Osiris's wife, the other is her sister, Nephthys,

101
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,563
who's a guardian of the afterlife and mother of Anubis,

102
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:13,945
the figure who we saw at the very beginning leading Hunefer into judgment.

103
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:18,639
Notice the white platform that those figure are standing on. That represents natron,

104
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,264
the natural salts that were deposited in the Nile and they were used by the ancient Egyptians

105
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,734
to dry out all of the mummies there in this room.

106
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,567
So that they could be preserved.

107
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:34,262
Actually, the word "preservation" is really a key to thinking about Egyptian culture generally,

108
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:37,111
because this is a culture whose forms,

109
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:42,291
whose representations and art remain remarkably the same for thousands of years.

110
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,869
Even though there are periods of instability or even just before this we have Amarna Period

111
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:50,526
where we saw a very different way of representing the human figure.

112
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:55,145
What we see here, these forms look very familiar to us,

113
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,274
because this is the typical way

114
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,104
the ancient Egyptians represented the human figure.

115
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:04,848
Even though this is a painting from the New Kingdom, these forms would have been recognizable

116
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:08,852
to Egyptians thousands of years earlier in the Old Kingdom.

117
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:12,484
And we see that mixture that we see very often in ancient Egyptian art,

118
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:16,195
of words, of hieroglyphs, of writing and images.

119
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:20,596
I love the mix, in our modern culture we really make a distinction

120
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,912
between written language and the visual arts,

121
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,397
and here in ancient Egypt,

122
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:28,165
there really is this closer relationship, this greater sense of integartion.
