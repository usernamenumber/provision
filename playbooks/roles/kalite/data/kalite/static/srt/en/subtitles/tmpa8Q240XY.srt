1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,995
This is the exact same problem

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:04,200
that I did in the last video, but I realized after looking

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,734
at the problem that I just mindlessly did the problem.

4
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:09,333
But there's actually a much simpler way of doing it.

5
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:12,800
So once again they're telling us to subtract and state the difference

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,933
in simplest form.

7
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:15,733
Now, what I did in the last video is I said, "Okay let's find

8
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,533
a common denominator and then I found it and then I

9
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,155
did the subtraction. But what I could have done

10
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,400
that would have simplified all of the math is that I could

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,533
have simplified each of the expressions first.

12
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,867
So let's do that!

13
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:28,537
So this first expression right over here,

14
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:30,733
both the numerator and the denominator is divisible

15
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,553
by "m", so let's divide them both by "m".

16
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:35,533
If you divide the numerator by "m" you get 1

17
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:37,667
if you divide the denominator by "m", "m"-squared

18
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,821
divided by "m" is just "m". This

19
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:43,607
second term right over here, both of them,

20
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,906
both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by

21
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,400
"n" to the third power. So let's divide the numerator by

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,876
"n" to the third power

23
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:54,102
you get a 1. You divide the denomintor,

24
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:55,800
you divide "n" to the fourth by "n" to the third power

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
you just get an "n".

26
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,533
And so we can rewrite this as 6 over, 6 times 1

27
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:09,867
so that's just 6, 6 over 7mn, minus 5, 'cause that's just 5 times 1

28
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:15,093
over 3mn. And this really simplifies the problem.

29
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:18,019
So let's think about a common denominator over here

30
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,400
So it's gonna be something minus something.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
So a common denominator has to be divisible by both 7 and 3,

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,533
so the least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21,

33
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:33,000
and it has to be divisible by "m" and it has to be divisble by "n"

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,759
21mn, and that also takes care of this.

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,756
21mn is clearly divisble by 7mn

36
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:40,867
and it's clearly divisible by 3mn, so it's got the mn

37
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,333
there it's divisible by 3 it's divisible by 7.

38
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,133
So that's our least common multiple, or you could say it's

39
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:51,333
our common denominator and to get from 7mn to 21mn,

40
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,800
you've gotta multiply by 3. And if you're multiplying

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,133
the denominator by 3, you've gotta multiply the numerator

42
00:01:56,133 --> 00:02:00,867
by 3 and you get 3 times 6 is equal to 18,

43
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:05,533
and to go from 3mn to 21mn, you gotta multiply by 7.

44
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:08,360
It's over here, you gotta multiply it by 7.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,333
And if you multiply the denominator by 7,

46
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,067
you gotta multiply the numerator by 7, if you don't

47
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,210
want to change the value of the expression.

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,600
So 5 times 7 is, is equal to 35

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,269
and then, so, this is going to be equal to

50
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,600
18 minus 35, so we have the, let me write it down,

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,733
we have a common denominator here of 21mn,

52
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,933
and we're gonna have to calculate 18 minus 35 in the numerator.

53
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:37,269
I'll just write it over here: 18 minus 35 in the numerator

54
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,733
and 18 minus 35 is negative 17

55
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:48,438
so we get -17 in the numerator over 21mn, and we are done

56
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,133
and I think that was a good bit simpler

57
00:02:50,133 --> 99:59:59,999
than the way we did it in the last video.
