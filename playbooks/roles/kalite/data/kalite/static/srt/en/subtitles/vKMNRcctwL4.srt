1
00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:07,563
A bug starts at a vertex of an equilateral traingle. On each move, it randomly selects one of the two

2
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:14,453
vertices where it is not currently located and crawls along a side of the triangle to that vertex.

3
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:21,419
Given that the probability that the bug moves to its starting vertex on its tenth move is m/n

4
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,501
where m and n are relatively prime positive integers,

5
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,652
find m + n

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,074
So this lesson right here where m and n are relatively prime positive integers

7
00:00:30,074 --> 00:00:35,670
essentially says we have the positive version of this fraction in its simplified form

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,677
So let's just think about the problem we have an equilateral triangle here

9
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:46,545
with three vertices

10
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:49,413
A B and C

11
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:54,376
and our bug is going to start at lets say vertex A

12
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:57,745
So this is our bug right here

13
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:01,227
and on each move it will randomly select one fo the two vertices

14
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:07,260
So on its first move it will either go to vertex B or then vertex C

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,077
and then depending on whether it went there

16
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:12,162
If it went to vertex C then on it's next move it wil either go to vertex B or vertex A

17
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:18,877
if it went to vertex B on its next move it will either go to vertex A or vertex C

18
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:22,118
So let's just think about it.

19
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:35,004
We want to figure out the probability of it moving to vertex a on its tenth move

20
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:38,324
So let's just think about what happened in each move.

21
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:42,469
The probability of moving toward on of the vertices in a given move

22
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:51,204
So let us say that we have move 1 over here in this column

23
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:57,885
so we have vertex A,B and C

24
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,669
so let's think about move one

25
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:09,604
On move 1 what's the probablilty of moving to vertex A

26
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:14,204
Well you are already on vertex A and it says that the insect in going to go to one of the other 2 vertices

27
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:19,787
So the probability on move one of moving to vertex A is 0

28
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,720
What's the probablilty of moving to vertex B?

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,021
Well it is going to be 1/2

30
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:27,036
what's the probablilty of moving to vertex C?

31
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:29,203
It's going to be 1/2 as well

32
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,036
half a chance of going there and half a chance fo going there

33
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:35,704
Well obviously all of the probabilities have to add up to 1 because it's going to do something on that

34
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:38,605
move. Now let us think about move 2

35
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:48,134
So what is the probability of now moving to vertex A?

36
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:57,682
Well there is a 1/2 chance that we are already at B. If we were already at B there will now be a 1/2

37
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:59,983
chance of moving back to A

38
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:04,462
So this is 1/2 times 1/2

39
00:03:04,462 --> 00:03:09,767
that's only the situation if we were already at B. If we were already at C

40
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:14,937
then there would also be a 1/2 probability of moving to A

41
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:24,003
So this is going be the 1/2 chance that we were already at C times the probability that we move to A

42
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:32,133
So 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/4 + 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/2

43
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:42,417
So what is the probability of moving to B in the second turn? Now the only place other than B

44
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:49,651
that the bug can move to is C in the second turn.

45
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:54,402
This is because we know that at the end of the first turn the bug will not be at A

46
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,402
It will either be at B or C

47
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,668
If the bug is already at B there is no way that it will go back to B

48
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:03,829
So the only situation is if the bug is already at C there is a 1/2 chance of that happening

49
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,317
so that is this number right here.

50
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:10,233
So if the bug is already at C and that is the 1/2 probablility then there is going to be a further 1/2

51
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,184
probability that it moves to B

52
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:17,834
So it is going to be 1/2 times 1/2 = 1/4

53
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:21,168
Now what is the probability of moving to C? Well it is the same logic.

54
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:30,034
The bug is not going to be on vertex A after the first move there is a 1/2 probability that it is going

55
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:37,519
to be at B; and then if it is at B then there is a 1/2 probability that it will go to C

56
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,267
So this is going to be 1/4 as well

57
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:58,548
In general let's say that in move N the probablility of being at vertex A is

58
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,281
the probability of A

59
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:06,116
The probability of being at vertex B is probability of landing on B at move N

60
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:12,032
and the probability of C is Probability of moving ot vertex C on move N

61
00:05:12,032 --> 00:05:16,331
Now let us think of the probability of being at each of these nodes on N+1

62
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:29,031
So in order to get to A on move n+1, you either have to be at B or C. You cannot be at A and stay at

63
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:29,631
A

64
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:39,234
So the probability of moving to A in your n+1th move is going to be the probability of being at B times

65
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:44,626
1/2 (right because if you are at B there is a one half chance that you are going to go to A) + the probability

66
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:51,926
of being at C at the end of your last move times 1/2

67
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:56,835
There is a half chance that if you are at C you will move to A. There is a half chance that if you are

68
00:05:56,835 --> 00:06:00,127
at C you will move to A.

69
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,759
Now what's the probability of going to B?

70
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,157
Well there are two ways that will get ot you B.

71
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,376
You can start at A so you are going to start at A

72
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:08,193
So the probablilty of being at A times 1/2

73
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:12,775
or you could start at C. So it's plus the probability at C times 1/2

74
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,309
If you were doing this problem in a situation that had time constraints you would not neccesarily have

75
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,298
to go through this, but I just want ot make it all clear.

76
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:22,724
And finally what is the probability of landing in C at you n+1th term

77
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:27,979
It's going to be the probability of being at A times 1/2

78
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,976
+ the probability of being at B times 1/2

79
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:37,242
So hopefully this makes the pattern of what is happening little bit clearer

80
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,609
So no matter what A is going to be the average.

81
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:45,126
A in the next move is essentially going to be the average the probabilities of being at B and C

82
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,692
And you can see that. The average of 1/2 and 1/2 is 1/2

83
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:56,525
The probability of being at B in the n+1th move is going to be the average of the probabilities of being

84
00:06:56,525 --> 00:07:00,258
at A and C in the last move the average of 0 and 1/2 is 1/4

85
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:06,074
and the same logic for C. The average for 0 and 1/2 is 1/4

86
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:13,176
Now that will help me simplify things a little bit more for our brains

87
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:16,525
Let's keep going this way and let me continue the columns

88
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:21,275
Rows A,B and C

89
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:25,092
and now we are on move 3. I am just continuing it down here

90
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:28,926
So what is the probability of the move being A in move 3

91
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:32,376
Well we just said it's going to be the average of B and C and B and C is 1/4

92
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:35,725
So the average of 1/4 and 1/4 is going to be 1/4

93
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,491
What is the probability of being at B?

94
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:47,242
Well the average of A and C in move two is 1/2 and 1/4

95
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:51,775
that's the same thing as the average of 4/8ths and 2/8ths

96
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,126
that's 3/8ths

97
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:57,391
and then we are going to get the exact same value for C. I think 3/8ths

98
00:07:57,391 --> 00:08:00,175
Another pattern here is that B and C are always going to be the same thing

99
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:04,558
and since B and C are always going to be the same thing the average is going to be that value

100
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:08,497
and it's going to be the probability of being at A in the next turn

101
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,873
So let us just keep doing this

102
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:14,006
and we can go all the way to ten but maybe we will see some type of pattern here

103
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:21,222
So on out fourth move what is the probability of being at A? Which is the average of B and C

104
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:24,473
So it is going to be 3/8ths

105
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:28,806
So we can just take this value here and then what is the probability of being at B?

106
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:34,089
Well it is going to be the average of A and C

107
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:44,566
and so let's see this is 4/16 + 6/16 = 10/16

108
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:52,773
and then we have to divide it by two which is 5/16

109
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:56,155
Did I do that right? Let me just do this on the corner. I don't want to make a careless mistake here.

110
00:08:56,155 --> 00:09:06,324
1/4 is 4/16 + 6/16 and then we want to divide that by two.

111
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:12,755
We are taking the average. So that's 10/16 divided by 2 which is equal to 5/16

112
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:17,139
Alright so let me clear theis out so that I do not waste valuable real estate

113
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,606
Alright. So then this is also going to be 5/16

114
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,790
because it's going to be the average of 3/8 and 1/4 as well

115
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,558
so it's going to be 5/16

116
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:32,623
Now we are on move 5

117
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:37,174
And we could keep going like this all the way to move ten but hopefully we willl see a pattern here

118
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:45,768
So move five the probability of moving to A is going to be 5/16 the average of these two

119
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,063
5/16

120
00:09:47,063 --> 00:09:50,318
The probability of moving to B (We can already see a pattern) it seems like we went from having

121
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:52,341
2,4,8 in the denominator to 16 in the denominator

122
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:56,216
I'm guessing that we are going to have to go to 32 in the denominator

123
00:09:56,216 --> 00:10:08,083
and so we are going to take the average of 10/32 and 12/32 and that is 11/32

124
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:11,649
And this is also going to be 11/32

125
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:23,130
Let's go to move 6 for A it's going to be 11/32 (it seems like the pattern is holding) this is going

126
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,345
ot be something over 64 and so this is the average if you multiply this times 4 you get 20

127
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:39,948
and then this is 20/64 and this is 22/64 the average is going to be 21

128
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:43,864
So let us keep extrapolating this and see if there is a way

129
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:48,947
and we could actually just keep doing the math for 7,8,9,10

130
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:53,829
Feel free to do that on your own if you are interested and hopefully you will get the right answer.

131
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,804
But let's see is you can spot a pattern here

132
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:01,111
This is also going to be 21/64 move 7 for A is easy. That's just going to be the average of these two

133
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,426
guys, 21/64

134
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,400
But let's see if there is a pattern forming

135
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,478
So it looks like the (and remember the question is we just want to look at the probability of it moving

136
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:14,013
to A on the tenth move.)

137
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:20,095
and so if you look at A you start off with a denominator

138
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:24,346
So this is 2 to the move minus 1. 1/2 to the move minus 1

139
00:11:24,346 --> 00:11:28,128
It looks like it's always cuz its 1/2 to the 0. This is 1/2 to the 1

140
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:31,479
and you have 1/2 squared that's 1 less than three

141
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,663
1/2 to the 3rd

142
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:39,163
So it looks like if you fast forward to the nth move or even better let us fast forward to the tenth

143
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:43,278
move. So 7, 8, 9 and 10

144
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,329
This is not actually a lot of math to fill in. But let us just figure it out

145
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:52,110
So 7,8,9, 10, this is going to be 16, 32, 64

146
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,206
This is going to be 128 if we go with the pattern

147
00:11:56,206 --> 00:12:05,646
This is going to be 256 and then this row over here is going to be over 512. So we actually already figured

148
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:10,747
out the n part. And lets see is we can figure out a pattern for the numerators here.

149
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:13,413
We went from 1 to 3 to 5

150
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:18,278
So let us see 5 is 3+2 not 1

151
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:26,041
Then we go, let's see you have 5 and it looks like you are taking 2times this and adding it to that to

152
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:34,279
get that. 2 times 1 plus 3 is five. 2 times 3 plus 5 is 11. 2 times 5 plus 11 is 21.

153
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,897
So let us just go with that

154
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:50,915
So 2 times 11 is 22 plus 21 is 43 and then 2 times 21 is 42 plus 43 is 85

155
00:12:50,915 --> 00:13:02,798
and then this is going to be 86 plus 85 is let's see 85 times two is 170 so its going to be 171

156
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:07,031
So if we believe what we just did we get out answer

157
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:18,030
m + n = 171 +512

158
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,408
Which is let's see we are going to have two plus 1 is 3

159
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:31,364
1 plus so this becomes ten and then we get 703. Wait I made a bone headed mistake on the addition

160
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:34,272
Let me do that again

161
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:40,021
So 1 plus 7 is 8 not 10. I don't know why my brain was thinking that and then 5 plus 1 is 6. So we get

162
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:44,355
683 as our answer

163
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:52,356
So that is m + n and the probability of moving to vertex A on the tenth turn is 171/512

164
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,838
and you can verify this for yourself

165
00:13:54,838 --> 00:14:03,689
Or we could even prove to ourselves is we are interested that each successive term here is really equal

166
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,439
to the previous term times two times the term before that

167
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:11,322
Actually for fun let us just prove it to ourselves

168
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:15,123
So let us just say that this is the nth term

169
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:24,972
Our probability of being at A is A/2^n

170
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:30,090
and what ends up happening is that the probability of being at b and C let us call that B/

171
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:37,722
This power is always 1 higher power of 2. 2 ^n plus 1 and this right over here is also going to be the

172
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:40,833
same probability 2/n+1

173
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:45,623
Then on the nth + 1 term the probability of being at A is just going to be the average of these two guys

174
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:49,872
which is going to be B times 2 to the n plus 1

175
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:54,138
and the probability of being at, this is B

176
00:14:54,138 --> 00:14:56,373
this is C, this is A

177
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:06,456
The probability of being at B is going ot be the average of 2A/ 2^(n+1) (I just multiplied the numerator

178
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:14,671
and the denominator by 2) plus B/2^(n+1)and then all of that over 2

179
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:24,488
So we are going to divide the whole thing by 2

180
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:29,337
and that's going to be the same value for C. And actaully if we do a little math here this is going

181
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:39,988
to be [2A + B]/[2^(n+2)]

182
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:46,572
And so on the nth+2 move our value for A is going to be this thing right here

183
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:50,339
The average of these two guys which is the exact same thing so it's going to be

184
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,872
[2A+B] / [2^(n+2)]

185
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:58,238
So this verifies the pattern that we just thought about

186
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:02,289
Our powers of two are increasing and so if we go two terms forward

187
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:07,874
This term is = to 2 times 2 terms before plus the terms before. 2A+B

188
00:16:07,874 --> 99:59:59,999
So that is the pattern that we used and we can feel pretty good about the answer!
