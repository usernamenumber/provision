1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,910
This exercise is from

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,880
chapter 12 of the Kotz, Treichel and Townsend

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,950
and Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity book,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,020
and I'm doing it with their permission.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,190
So they tell us you place 2 liters of water

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,110
in an open container in your dormitory room.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,590
The room has a volume of

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,345
4.25 times 10 to the fourth liters.

9
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,100
You seal the room and wait for the water to evaporate.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,170
Will all of the water evaporate

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,700
at 25 degrees Celsius?

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,580
And then they tell us at 25 degrees Celsius,

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,050
the density of water is 0.997 grams per milliliter.

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:44,180
And its vapor pressure is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,210
And this is actually the key clue

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:47,720
to tell you how to solve this problem.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,730
And just as a bit of review,

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,110
lets just think about what vapor pressure is.

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,820
Let's say it's some temperature,

20
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,820
and in this case we're dealing at 25 degrees Celsius.

21
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,180
I have a bunch of water,

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,530
and let me do that in a water color.

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,140
I have a bunch of water molecules

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,545
sitting here in a container.

25
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,100
At 25 degrees Celsius,

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,150
they're all bouncing around in every which way.

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,790
And every now and then

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,380
one of them is going to have enough kinetic energy

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,530
to kind of escape the hydrogen bonds

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,680
and all the things

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,410
that keep liquid water in its liquid state

32
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,140
and it will escape.

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,780
It'll go off in that direction,

34
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,955
and then another one will.

35
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,190
And this'll just keep happening.

36
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,310
The water will naturally vaporize in a room.

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,930
But at some point,

38
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,805
enough of these molecules have vaporized over here

39
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,680
that they're also bumping back into the water.

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,910
And maybe some of them can be captured back

41
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,520
into the liquid state.

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,010
Now, the pressure at which this happens

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,380
is the vapor pressure.

44
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,190
As you can imagine,

45
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,025
as more and more these water molecules vaporize

46
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,860
and go into the gaseous state,

47
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,000
more and more will also create pressure,

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,135
downward pressure.

49
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,270
More and more will also be

50
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,840
colliding with the surface of the water.

51
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,020
And the pressure at which

52
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,170
the liquid and the vapor states are in equilibrium

53
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,780
is the vapor pressure.

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,390
And they're telling us right now.

55
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,230
It is 23.8 millimeters of mercury.

56
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,870
Now, what we need to do to figure out this problem is

57
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,320
say, OK, if we could figure out

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,075
how many molecules need to evaporate

59
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:29,830
how many molecules of water need to evaporate

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,690
to give us this vapor pressure,

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,250
we can then use the density of water

62
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,815
to figure out how many liters of water that is.

63
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,380
So how do we figure out how many molecules--

64
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:50,035
let me write this down

65
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:59,690
--how many molecules of water need to evaporate

66
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:14,740
to give us the vapor pressure of

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
23.8 millimeters of mercury?

68
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
So what, I guess, law or formula--

69
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,450
and I never like to just memorize formulas,

70
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,030
but we've given this formula in the past

71
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,630
and it's probably one of the top most useful formulas

72
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,230
in chemistry, or really all of science--

73
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,230
what formula or law deals with pressure?

74
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,230
They give us the volume of the room

75
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,890
because that's where the pressure will be inside of.

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,050
So we have pressure, the equilibrium vapor pressure.

77
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,620
We have a volume of a room right over here.

78
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,150
We know the temperature of the room right over there.

79
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,650
And we're trying to figure out the number of molecules

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,290
that need to evaporate for us to get that pressure

81
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,130
in that volume at that temperature.

82
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,960
So what deals with pressure, volume,

83
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,070
number of molecules, let's say in moles,

84
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,385
so I'll write a lower case n

85
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:10,700
number of molecules, and temperature?

86
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,170
Well, we've seen this many, many times.

87
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,920
It's the Ideal Gas Law.

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,600
Pressure times volume is equal to

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,515
the number of moles of our idea gas

90
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,430
in this case we're going to use water as our ideal gas

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,140
or vapor as our ideal gas

92
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,950
times the universal gas constant times temperature.

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,600
And this should never seem like some bizarre formula to

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,990
you because it really,
really makes sense.

95
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,020
If your pressure goes up, then
that means that either the

96
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,660
number of molecules have gone
up, and we're assuming the

97
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,830
volume is constant.

98
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,700
That means either the number
of molecules have gone up,

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,890
which makes sense-- more things
bouncing onto the side

100
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,740
of the container.

101
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,820
Or your temperature has gone
up-- the same number of

102
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,480
things, but they're bumping with
higher kinetic energy.

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,110
Or if your pressure stays the
same and your volume goes up,

104
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,230
then that also means that your
number of molecules went up,

105
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,370
or your temperature went up.

106
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,760
Because you now have
a bigger container.

107
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,270
In order to exert the same
pressure you need either more

108
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,070
molecules or more kinetic energy
for the molecules you

109
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,215
have.

110
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:14,200
And you could keep playing
around with this, but I just

111
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,750
want to make it clear this isn't
some mysterious formula.

112
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,810
The first time I was exposed to
this I kind of did view it

113
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,490
as some type of mysterious
formula.

114
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,230
But it's just relating pressure,
volume, number of

115
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,980
molecules and temperature.

116
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,320
And then this is just the
universal gas constant.

117
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,370
So let's just get everything
into the right units here.

118
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,585
And then what we're trying to
solve for, we want to figure

119
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,290
out the number of molecules
of water.

120
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,780
So we want to solve for n.

121
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,210
And if we know the number of
moles of water, we can figure

122
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,320
out the number of
grams of water.

123
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,580
And then given the density of
water we can figure out the

124
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,880
number of milliliters of water
we are dealing with.

125
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,120
So let's just rewrite the Ideal
Gas Law by dividing both

126
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,340
sides by the universal gas
constant and temperature.

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:07,245
So that you get n is equal to
pressure times volume, over

128
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,680
the universal gas constant
times temperature.

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,290
Now, the hardest thing about
this is just making sure you

130
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,490
have your units right and you're
using the right ideal

131
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,150
gas constant for the right
units, and we'll

132
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,310
do that right here.

133
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:24,020
So what I want to do, because
the universal gas constant

134
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,960
that I have is in terms of
atmospheres, we need to figure

135
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,800
out this vapor pressuree- this
equilibrium pressure between

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,770
vapor and liquid-- we need to
write this down in terms of

137
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,040
atmospheres.

138
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,450
So let me write this down.

139
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:47,260
So the vapor pressure
is equal to 23.8

140
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,350
millimeters of mercury.

141
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,040
And you can look it up at a
table if you don't have this

142
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,710
in your brain.

143
00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:06,540
One atmosphere is equivalent to
760 millimeters of mercury.

144
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,110
So if we wanted to write
the vapor pressure as

145
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,580
atmospheres-- let me get my
calculator out, get the

146
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,690
calculator out, put it right
over there-- so it's going to

147
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:24,140
be 23.8 times 1 over 760,
or just divided by 760.

148
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,210
And we have three significant
digits, so

149
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,920
it looks like 0.0313.

150
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:40,110
So this is equal to 0.0313
atmospheres.

151
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,590
That is our vapor pressure.

152
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,110
So let's just deal with
this right here.

153
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,780
So the number of molecules of
water that are going to be in

154
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,900
the air in the gaseous state,
in the vapor state, is going

155
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,740
to be equal to our
vapor pressure.

156
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,990
That's our equilibrium
pressure.

157
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,240
If more water molecules
evaporate after that point,

158
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,140
then we're going to have a
higher pressure, which will

159
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,130
actually make them favor more of
them going into the liquid

160
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,570
state, so we'll go kind of past
the equilibrium, which is

161
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,140
not likely.

162
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,060
Or another way to think about
it-- more water molecules are

163
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,455
not going to of evaporate at
a faster rate than they are

164
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:15,050
going to condense beyond
that pressure.

165
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,070
Anyway, the pressure here
is 0.0313 atmospheres.

166
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,420
The volume here-- they told us
right over here-- so that's

167
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,880
the volume-- 4.25.

168
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,210
4.25 times 10 to the
fourth liters.

169
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,720
And then we want to divide that
by-- and you want to make

170
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,610
sure that your universal gas
constant has the right units,

171
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,370
I just looked mine up on
Wikipedia-- 0.08-- see

172
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,170
everything has three
significant digits.

173
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,250
So let me just allow that more
significant digits and we'll

174
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,820
just round at the end.

175
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:07,540
0.082057, and the units here
are liters atmospheres per

176
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,420
mole at kelvin.

177
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,310
And this makes sense.

178
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,890
This liter will cancel
out with that liter.

179
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,330
That atmospheres cancels out
with that atmospheres.

180
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,940
I'm about to multiply
it by temperature

181
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,150
right here in kelvin.

182
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,220
We'll cancel out there.

183
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,920
And then we'll have a 1 over
moles in the denominator.

184
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,290
A 1 over moles in the
denominator will just be a

185
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,150
moles because you're going
to invert it again.

186
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,230
So that gives us our
answer in moles.

187
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,450
And so finally our temperature--
and you've got

188
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,490
to remember you've got
to do it in kelvin.

189
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,800
So 25 degrees Celsius-- let
me right it over here-- 25

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,160
degrees Celsius is equal to,
you just add 273 to it, so

191
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,300
this is equal to 298 kelvin.

192
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,360
So times 298 kelvin.

193
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,490
And now we just have
to calculate this.

194
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,740
So let's do that.

195
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,270
So let me clear this out.

196
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,010
So we have-- let me use my
keyboard-- so 0.0313

197
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:21,340
atmospheres times 4.25 times
10 to the fourth.

198
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,340
That e just means times
10 to the fourth.

199
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,220
That's just the way that it
works on this calculator.

200
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:39,310
And then divided by 0.082057
divided by-- actually, just to

201
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,100
make it clear, let me show you
that I'm dividing by this

202
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,610
whole thing, so let me insert
some parentheses right here.

203
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,300
So in the denominator we also
are multiplying by 298.

204
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,285
And let me close the
parentheses.

205
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,270
And then we get 54.4.

206
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,710
We only have three significant
digits.

207
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,850
So this is equal
to 54.4 moles.

208
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,580
And we could see this liters
cancels out with that liters.

209
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,300
Kelvin cancels out
with kelvin.

210
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,880
Atmospheres with atmospheres.

211
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
You have a 1 over mole
in the denominator.

212
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,040
So then 1 over 1 over moles
is just going to be moles.

213
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,730
Now, this is going to be 54.4
moles of water vapor in the

214
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,580
room to have our
vapor pressure.

215
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,070
If more evaporates, then more
will condense-- we will be

216
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,800
beyond our equilibrium.

217
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,610
So we won't ever have more
than this amount

218
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,890
evaporate in that room.

219
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,440
So let's figure out how much
liquid water that actually is.

220
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,550
Let me do it over here.

221
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:59,170
So 54.4 moles-- let me write
it down-- moles of H2O.

222
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,386
That's going to be in
its vapor form and

223
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,780
its going to evaporate.

224
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,270
But let's figure out how
many grams that is.

225
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,560
So what is the molar
mass of water?

226
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,110
Well, it's roughly 18.

227
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,910
I actually figured
it out exactly.

228
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,600
It's actually 18.01 if you
actually use the exact numbers

229
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,880
on the periodic table, at
least one that I used.

230
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:28,120
So we could say that there's
18.01 grams of H2O for every 1

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,490
mole of H2O.

232
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,580
And obviously, you can just look
up the atomic weight of

233
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,470
hydrogen, which is a little
bit over 1, and the atomic

234
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,955
weight of oxygen, which is
a little bit below 16.

235
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,250
So you have two of these.

236
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,530
So 2 plus 16 gives you
pretty close to 18.

237
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,990
So this right here will tell
you the grams of water that

238
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,760
can evaporate to get us to that
equilibrium pressure.

239
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,580
So let's get the
calculator out.

240
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:05,090
So we have the 54.4 times 18.01
is equal to 970-- well,

241
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,650
we only have three significant
digits-- so 900, if your round

242
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,380
this 0.7, it becomes 980.

243
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:17,180
So this is 980 grams of H2O
needs to evaporate for us to

244
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,160
get to our equilibrium
pressure,

245
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,540
to our vapor pressure.

246
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,180
So let's figure out how many
milliliters of water this is.

247
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,090
So they tell us the density
of water right here.

248
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:33,500
0.997-- let me do this in a
darker color-- 0.997 grams per

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,920
millileter.

250
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,370
Or another way you could view
this is for everyone 1

251
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:49,780
milliliter you have 0.997
grams of water

252
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,810
at 25 degrees Celsius.

253
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,200
So for every milliliter-- this
is grams per milliliter-- we

254
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,470
want milliliters per gram
because we want this and this

255
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,600
to cancel out.

256
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,260
So we're essentially just going
to divide 980 by 0.997.

257
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,185
So what is that?

258
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:06,860
Get the calculator out.

259
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:16,760
So we have 980-- not cover up
our work-- divided by 0.997 is

260
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,580
equal to 980-- we'll just
round this-- 983.

261
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,930
So this is equal to 983.

262
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,230
This and this canceled out, or
that and that canceled out.

263
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,620
So 983 milliliters of H2O.

264
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,140
So we've figured out, using the
Ideal Gas Law, that at 25

265
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,090
degrees Celsius, which was 298
kelvin, that 983 milliliters

266
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,520
of H2O will evaporate
to get us to our

267
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,730
equilibrium vapor pressure.

268
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,590
Nothing more will evaporate,
because beyond that if we have

269
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,540
higher pressure than that, then
you'll also have more

270
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,930
vapor going to the
liquid state.

271
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,640
Because you'll have more
stuff bouncing here.

272
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,950
So if this much volume of water
evaporates, we'll have

273
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,020
the state where just as much is
evaporating as just as much

274
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,700
is condensing.

275
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,350
So you will never get to a
higher pressure than that at

276
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,190
that temperature.

277
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,320
So going back to the question,
we figured out that 983

278
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,990
milliliters of water
will evaporate.

279
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,940
The question was is that we
placed 2 liters of water in an

280
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,360
open container.

281
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,920
So we just figured out that only
983 milliliters of that--

282
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,200
so that's a little bit
less than a liter.

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,460
So this is a little bit less
than 1,000 milliliters, and

284
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,960
this is 1 liter.

285
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,050
So a little bit less than half
of this will evaporate for us

286
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,430
to get to our vapor pressure.

287
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,370
So to answer our question--
will all of the water

288
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,390
evaporate at 25 degrees
Celsius?

289
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,730
No-- if we're assuming the room
is sealed-- well, no, all

290
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,870
of it will not.

291
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,980
Only a little bit less
than half of it will.
