1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:03,785
Where we left off in the last video, we were just kind of staring,

2
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:07,964
amazed at this Earth's view of the Milky Way Galaxy,

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:12,794
just making sure we understood how enormous and how many stars we were looking at

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:16,649
and even this, even if each of these dots were stars this is a huge amount of stars

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:21,267
but a lot of these dots are thousands of stars, are thousands of stars, so, so this

6
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:25,379
our minds were already blown but what we're going to see in this video

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,974
in some ways this is kind of just the beginning. And to some I am going to stop doing the particles of

8
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:38,400
grain in the football field analogy, because at some point the particles of sand become so vast that our

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,701
mind cannot even grasp it to begin with, but let's just start with our Milky Way

10
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:48,667
and we saw in the last video the Milky Way right here - we're sitting here about 25,000 lightyears away from

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:57,051
the center, it's roughly 100,000 light years in diameter, and then let's put it in perspective

12
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:00,467
of its local neighborhood, so let's look at the local group,

13
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,785
and when we talk about local group we're talking about the local group of galaxies

14
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:10,798
of galaxies. so this right here is the Milky Way's local group, that's us right there

15
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:16,045
sitting right over here about 25,000 light years from the center of the Milky Way

16
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:22,965
you have some of these small, and I use the word "small" in quotation marks because these are also vast

17
00:01:22,965 --> 00:01:27,867
entities also unimaginable entities but we have these satellite galaxies

18
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:34,993
around under the gravitational influence some of them, of the Milky Way, but the nearest large galaxy

19
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:39,962
to us is Andromeda right over here, and this distance right over here and now were going to start talking

20
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:51,340
in the millions of light years so this distance right here is 2.5 million, 2.5 millon light years just

21
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:59,699
as a bit of reference if that's any reference at all 1 light year is roughly the radius of the Oort cloud

22
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:06,133
and the Oort cloud was, or another way to think about it, the Oort cloud or one radius of the Oort cloud

23
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:14,800
is about 50 or 60 thousand astronomical units and that's the distance from the Sun to the Earth, so you could view

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,708
this as 2.5 million times 60,000 times the distance from the Sun to the Earth so this is an unbelievably

25
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:28,817
large distance we're talking about here and that's to get to the next big galaxy over here

26
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:35,365
but even these things are huge things with many, i mean just unfathomably many stars, but Andromeda in

27
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:40,400
particular you, you know we said that the Milky Way 200-400 billion stars

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:50,467
Andromeda people believe has on the order of 1 trillion stars, even these just start to become numbers

29
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:57,145
its hard to grasp, but were not going to stop here so in this, over here this whole diagram over here

30
00:02:57,145 --> 00:03:01,667
its about 4 lightyears across if you go point to point if you go from one side to the other side

31
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:07,455
this is about... not 4 light years, sorry, this is 4 million light years... 4 million...

32
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:17,718
4 light years is just the distance from us to the Alpha Centauri, so that's nothing,

33
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:22,130
that would only take Voyager 1 80,000 years to get to.

34
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,727
This is 4 million light years, so 4 million times the distance to the nearest star.

35
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:33,043
But even this, even this is... I'm starting to stumble on my words, there are no words to describe this,

36
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:38,477
even this is small on an intergalactic scale,

37
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:46,046
because when you zoom out more, you can see our local group - it's right over here

38
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:51,805
and this right over here is the Virgo Supercluster,

39
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:55,984
and each dot here is at least one galaxy, but it might be more than one galaxy,

40
00:03:55,984 --> 00:04:10,984
and the diameter here is 150 million... 150 million light years.

41
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:18,467
So what we so in the local group in the last diagram, the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda,

42
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,400
which was 2.5 million light years, which would be just this litte dot,

43
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,733
just like that, that would be the distance between the Milky Way and the Andromeda.

44
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:30,303
And now we're looking at the Virgo Supercluster, and that is 150 million light years

45
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:37,316
but we're not done yet, we can zoom out even more! We can zoom out even more... and over here,

46
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:44,281
so you had the Virgo Supercluster, 150 million light years, in the last diagram,

47
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:48,300
this diagram here, I'd like to keep both of them on the screen if I can, this diagram

48
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,660
right here, 150 million light years across, that would fit right about here, on this diagram.

49
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,714
So this is all of the superclusters that are near us, and once again, near has to be used very loosely,

50
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:12,617
here, this distance is about 150 million light years, a billion light years is 2... 3... 4... 5...

51
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:19,994
a billion lightyears is about from here to there, so we start to talk on very massive... I guess we've

52
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:24,638
always been talking on a massive scale, but now it's an even more massive scale. We're still not done!

53
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:28,800
Because this whole diagram, these dots that you're seeing now, I wanna make it very clear,

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,137
these aren'r stars, these aren' even clusters of stars, or clusters of millions or billions of stars,

55
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:40,637
each of these dots are clusters of galaxies, each of those galaxies having

56
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:47,069
hundreds of billions to trillions of stars, so we're just at an unbelievably massive scale at this point,

57
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,810
but we're still not done, this is roughly about a billion light years across,

58
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:58,772
right here is actually the best estimate of the visible universe, and in future videos

59
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,067
we will talk a lot more about what the visible universe means,

60
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,800
so if you zoom out enough, this entire diagram right here,

61
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,121
about a billion light years, would fit right over... would fit just like that.

62
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:22,317
So we're talking about a super small amount of this part right here...

63
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,057
and this is just the visible universe, I wanna make it clear, this is not

64
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:28,447
the entire universe, and we say the visible universe, 'cause think about what's happening,

65
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:36,481
think about a point out here, and we're observing it, let's say, it's 13 billion light years away,

66
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:44,733
we're gonna talk more about this in future videos, 13 billion light years,

67
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:50,970
and I feel it's almost a sacrilage to be writing on this,

68
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,081
because this complexity that we're seeing here is just mindboggling,

69
00:06:54,081 --> 00:07:00,444
but this 13 billion lightyear away object, we're observing... the light's just getting to us....

70
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:09,133
the light left at some point, 13 billion lightyears ago, so we're actually observing this object

71
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:13,726
close to the beginning of the actual universe, and the reason why it's the visible universe

72
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:18,400
is there might have been something a little bit further out, maybe it's light hasn't reached us yet,

73
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,781
or maybe the universe itself, we'll talk more about this, is expanding so fast

74
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:27,472
that the light will never ever reach us, so it's actually a huge question mark,

75
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:33,648
on how big the actual universe is, and then some people might say

76
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:38,153
well, does it even matter? - because this by itself is a huge, huge distance,

77
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:42,147
and I wanna make it clear, you might say, OK, if this light over here

78
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:47,394
this is coming from 13 billion light years away, or this is 13 billion light years away,

79
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:51,806
then you could say, hey, so everything that we could observe, that we can observe the past of,

80
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:55,800
is about 26 billion light years, but even there we have to be careful,

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,676
'cause remember, the universe is expanding: when this light was emitted,

82
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:04,113
and I'll do a whole video on this, because the geometry of it is kind of hard to visualize,

83
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:08,153
when this light was emitted, where we are, in the Virgo Supercluster,

84
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:14,144
inside of the Milky Way galaxy, where we are was much closer to that point,

85
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:18,463
it was on the order of, and I wanna make sure I get this right,

86
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:25,986
36 million light years, so we were super close by, you know, astronomical scales,

87
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:32,302
we were super close only 36 million light years to this object when that light was released,

88
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:35,460
but that light was coming to us and the whole time the universe expanding, so we were

89
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,314
also moving away from it, if you just think about it, all the space, everything

90
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:42,733
is expanding away from each other, and only 13 billion years later

91
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:46,133
did it finally catch up with us. But the whole time it was happening,

92
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:53,533
this object has also been moving away from us, so our best estimate of where this object is now

93
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:59,794
based on how space is expanding, is on the order of 40 or 45 billon light years away.

94
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:04,400
We are just observing where that light was emitted 13 billion years ago. I wanna be very clear,

95
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,129
what we are observing, this light is coming from something very primitive,

96
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,469
that object, that area of space where that light was emitted from,

97
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:20,800
has now condensed into way more mature astronomical structures,

98
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,104
if you take it from the other point of view, people sitting in this point of space now

99
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:30,073
and now they've moved 46 billion light years out, when they observe our region of space,

100
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,533
they're not going to see us, they are not gonna see Earth as it is now,

101
00:09:32,533 --> 00:09:39,315
they're gonna see the region of space where Earth is, at a super primitive stage,

102
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:43,448
shortly after the Big Bang - when I use words like 'shortly', I use that also loosely,

103
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:47,067
we're talking about hundreds of thousands or even millions of years,

104
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:50,135
so I'll talk more about that in a future video, but the whole point of this video is

105
00:09:50,135 --> 00:09:56,333
you know, it's beyond mind numbing, you know, I would say the last video about the Milky Way

106
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,144
that alone was mind numbing, but now we are in a reality where

107
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:05,460
just the Milky Way becomes something that's almost unbelievably insignificant

108
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,408
when you think about this picture right here. And the really mind numbing thing is,

109
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:15,133
if someone told me that this is the entire universe, this by itself would certainly

110
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:19,067
put things in perspective, but it is unknown what's beyond it! There are some estimates

111
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:23,804
that this might be only one times 10th on the 23rd of the entire universe

112
00:10:23,804 --> 00:10:27,984
and it might even turn out that the entire universe is smaller than this

113
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:30,631
and that's an interesting thing to think about, but I'll leave you there,

114
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:35,135
because I think no matter how you think about it, it's just, I don't know,

115
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,337
actually before doing this video I stared at some of these photos for like half an hour,

116
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:44,400
this is my least productive day, just because it's so awe-inspiring to think about

117
00:10:44,400 --> 99:59:59,999
what these dots and dots of the dots really are.
