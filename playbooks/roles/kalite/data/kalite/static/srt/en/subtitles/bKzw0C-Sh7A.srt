1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,230
We are on problem number 19.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,030
If a, b, c, and f are four non-zero numbers--

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,400
I don't know where they got f.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,120
I would have expected a d--

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,990
but a, b, c, and f are four non-zero numbers,

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,740
then all of the following proportions

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,880
are equivalent except-- OK. So this is interesting.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,430
This is one where you have to work through all of them.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:32,180
So choice a, a/f is equal to b/c.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,500
Let's see, choice b says f/c is equal to b/a.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,360
So the real simple way of doing this,

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,290
let's cross multiply all of them, essentially, right?

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,130
So we can cross multiply.

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,610
If we multiply both sides by,essentially, fc--

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,380
and that's what cross multiplying is--

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,960
so we said a times c, ac is equal to bf, right?

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,720
a times c is equal to b times f.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,950
And you can get there multiplying both sides by f

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,490
and multiplying both sides by c.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:13,460
If we cross multiply on this side, we have af is equal to bc.

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,980
This is an f here. ac is equal to bf.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,200
Here we have af is equal to bc.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,060
Let's see, choice c is c/a is equal to f/b.

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,060
What does this tell us?

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,450
This tells us that cb or bc, bc is equal to af.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,410
So these two are equal.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,770
These two are the same thing, right?

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,900
In d, we have a/c is equal to b/f.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Now if we cross multiply, you get af is equal to bc.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,840
These are equal. I think you see a pattern.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,880
I suspect that e is going to look very similar to these three

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,360
and that this is the different one.

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,160
But just to do it,I'll show you.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,400
Choice e has af/bc is equal to 1, essentially.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,380
So that's af is equal to bc,

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,260
which is the same thing as all these.

37
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,080
So a is the one choice that is different.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,010
ac is equal to bf is very different than

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,630
af is equal to bc, right?

40
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,870
We're multiplying different things.

41
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,990
These are all the same. Hopefully you see that.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,290
And that's multiplication is communicative and all that.

43
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,380
So it doesn't matter what order,

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,500
fa and af are the same thing.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,030
But here, we're multiplying.

46
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,920
It was saying ac is equal to bf.

47
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,240
Let's do problem number 20.

48
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,120
And you could actually, in that last problem,

49
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,990
literally try it with four different non-zero numbers.

50
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,960
It actually should work out, if you pick good numbers,

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,420
if you don't want to deal with the abstract letters.

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,190
Problem number 20.

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,970
For all numbers x and y,

54
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,400
let the operation square be defined as

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:14,640
x square y is equal to xy minus y.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,190
If a and b are positive integers,

57
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,270
which of the following can be equal to 0?

58
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,020
So a, b positive integers.

59
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,400
So which can be equal to 0?

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,570
So they're saying choice number one is a square b.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,540
And that, we learned from here,

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,640
is the same thing as a times b, right?

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,420
It's just pattern matching,wherever you see the x,

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,150
you put an a. Wherever you see the y, you put a b.

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:49,180
So that's ab minus y. Sorry, ab minus b, right?

66
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,410
And can I come up with a situation

67
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,260
where this comes out to be 0?

68
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,200
Well sure. If a is 1, what happens when a is 1?

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,450
If a is 1, then this translates to b minus b,

70
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,530
which equals 0, right?

71
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,050
And why did I think what happens when a is 1?

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,410
Well,this could also be written as a minus 1 times b,right?

73
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,900
If you just factored out the b's.

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,740
So I said well, if a is 1,then this term becomes 0.

75
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,930
So 1, this definitely can be equal to 0.

76
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,590
It's not always 0, but it can be, especially if a is 1.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
OK, let's do choice two.

78
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:36,570
They wrote a plus b square b. And what is that equal to?

79
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,590
Well, every time you saw an x,replace it with a plus b.

80
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,550
Every time you see a y,replace it with b.

81
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,860
So that's equal to-- that equals--

82
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,500
I'll switch colors for variety,

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,650
just so you don't get confused with this top part--

84
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,880
that's equal to a plus b times b--

85
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,490
times the second term,

86
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,870
times b-- minus the second term, minus b.

87
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,090
So we can't do what we did the previous time,

88
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,060
because now the term a plus b can't equal 1, right?

89
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,210
There's no circumstance under a plus b equals 1. How?

90
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,800
Because they're both positive,they're both integers, right?

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,710
So in order for this to equal 1,one would have to be 1,

92
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,980
and one would have to be 0.

93
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,000
And neither of them can be negative.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,390
So this can't equal 1.

95
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,510
So that's not a situation in which this is equal to 0.

96
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,060
So let's see if we can solve it.

97
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,350
What's that equal to 0?

98
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,800
And of course, b can't be equal to 0.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,610
So we see a plus b. We could factor it out.

100
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:50,330
We could say a plus b minus 1 times b is equal to 0, right?

101
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,610
We know b can't equal 0 under any circumstances, right?

102
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,860
We know b can't equal 0,

103
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,560
because we're saying it's a positive integer.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,280
And so this term would have to be equal to 0.

105
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,400
You could multiply this out and you'll see where I got--

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,630
I just factored out just the same.

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,350
I divided each of these terms by b and factored it out.

108
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,360
And then you're left with a plus b minus 1,

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,150
all of that times b.

110
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,210
So if b can't equal 0, can a plus b minus 1 equal 0?

111
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,890
Well a plus b minus 1 equals 0.

112
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,860
Then a plus b would have to equal 1, which I said,

113
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,240
it just can't happen.

114
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,430
So under no circumstances can choice two be equal to 0.

115
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,210
And now, what does choice three say?

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,220
Choice three is a square a plus b.

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:52,420
And if we map it, that's a times a plus b minus a plus b.

118
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,620
And now here, once again, we can factor out the a plus b.

119
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,050
So we could write this as a minus 1 times a plus b.

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,130
And we want to see if that equals 0,see if this is possible.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,490
Well for this to be equal to 0,

122
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,840
either this term would have to be 0,

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,400
or this term, or both of them, really.

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,170
Can a plus b equal 0?

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,090
No, because a is positive,b is positive,

126
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,580
they're both integers. Nothing's negative.

127
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,650
They have to be greater than 0,

128
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,490
so there's no way that this is going to be equal to 0.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
But can a minus one equal 0?

130
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,290
Well sure, a could be 1.

131
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,430
If a is 1, then this expression becomes 0.

132
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,220
So this one also works. So our choices--

133
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,810
the ones that could be 0-- are one and three.

134
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,750
And that is choice E.

135
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
I'll see you in the next section.
