1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,610
We're on problem 167.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,360
If 1 plus 1 over x is equal to 2 minus 2 over x,

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,770
then what does x equal?

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,800
The first thing I would do is--

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,710
I don't like these x's in the denominator.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,840
So let's just multiply both sides of this equation by x.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:30,660
So I'll get x plus-- x over x is just 1-- equals 2x minus 2.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,500
Now I can subtract 1 from both sides. Actually,

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,050
let's add 2 to both sides,so you get x plus 3 is equal to 2x.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,970
Let's subtract x from both sides. You get 3 is equal to x.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,670
And that's choice E. I think I have the hiccups.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,690
I hope you don't notice, or if you do,

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,910
I hope it doesn't bother you.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,490
Problem 168.

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,190
Last year, for every 100 million vehicles that

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,310
traveled on a certain highway,

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,000
96 vehicles were involved in accidents.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,920
So 96 vehicles for every 100 million.

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,670
So 100 times a million is 10 to the sixth vehicles.

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,250
If 3 billion vehicles traveled on the highway last year,

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,230
how many of those vehicles were involved in accidents?

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,440
You could view this as the fraction that will be involved

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,850
in accidents, so we just multiply that times the total

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,400
number of vehicles. That's 3 times a billion.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,610
And they even write a billion as 1 with 9 0's,

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,010
so it's 3 times 10 to the ninth.

27
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,020
So if we simplify this a little bit,let's see what we can do.

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,150
So 100 times 10 to the sixth,

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,010
this is the same thing as 1 times 10 to the eighth.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,450
You could view this as 10 to the second times 10 to the

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,350
sixth is 10 to the eighth. If you have a 10 to the ninth

32
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,290
in the denominator divided by 10 to the eighth,

33
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,620
this cancels out and you're just left with a 10. So the

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:09,440
denominator becomes 1, and the numerator becomes 96 times 30.

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:19,810
And 96 times 30 is-- let's put a 0 here and then 3 times 6 is

36
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,620
18, 3 times 9 is 27 plus 1 is 28.

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,110
How many vehicles are involved in accidents? 2,880, C.

38
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,970
I think this number is low compared to the reality.

39
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,470
I think actually it's closer to the 40,000 range.

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,870
That's what want.

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,550
How many of those vehicles are involved in accidents?

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,300
We multiply the fraction that have an accident times the

43
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,840
total number of vehicles,and then you get your answer. 2,880.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Next question, 169.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,060
30% of the members of a swim team have passed the

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,030
lifesaving test. So 30% passed.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,000
Among the members who not have passed the test,

48
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,030
12 have taken the preparatory course.

49
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,390
So this the 70% not passed.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,000
And they say that 12 have taken a course, so 12 course.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
And 30 have not taken the course.

52
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,760
How many members are in the swim club?

53
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,060
So many people have not passed the test?

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,630
They said that 12 have taken a course, 30 haven't.

55
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm assuming that's all of them.

56
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,500
So the 70% that have not passed,

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,470
that is 12 plus 30 is equal to 42.

58
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,030
And this is 70% of the total people in the swim club.

59
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,010
So 70% of the total is equal to 42.

60
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,080
So the total is equal to 42 divided by 0.7.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,650
42 divided by 7 would be 6,

62
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,240
but since we're dividing it by 1/10 of that,

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,210
it's going to be equal to 60. And that make sense.

64
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,790
70% of 60 is 42.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,120
So there's 60 people in the swim club, and that's A.

66
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,580
Problem 170.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,710
In a certain company, the ratio of the number of

68
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,640
managers to the number of production line workers is 5:72.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,020
If 8 additional production line workers were to be hired,

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,790
the ratio of the number of managers to the number of

71
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,070
production line workers would be 5:74.

72
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:51,800
So if we hire 8 more workers,then the ratio is equal to 5:74.

73
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,070
How many managers does the company have?

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,390
So this is interesting. Let's think of it this way.

75
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,020
There's a quick way to think about it,

76
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,600
and then there's an algebraic way, and we'll do both of them.

77
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,620
But when we add 8 to the bottom of this--

78
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,740
when we add 8 to the number of workers--

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,700
the ratio actually only increased by 2.

80
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,840
So what's happening is we probably have 4 times

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,600
as many workers as this ratio predicts.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:36,000
So the ratio is probably 20:288.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,550
And let's think about that logic.

84
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,840
Because 20/288-- this is 5/72 if you were to divide the top

85
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,470
and the bottom by 4-- and if you were add 8 to the bottom,

86
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,310
you would get 20/296. And then if you divide this by 4,

87
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,370
if you just take this to the lowest reduced form, you get 5.

88
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,010
Divide that by 4. This divided by 4 is what? It's 74.

89
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,670
So if you see that intuition that I'm talking about,

90
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,090
that when you add 8 workers it only increased this reduced

91
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,570
form by 2, that means that this reduced form is probably 1/4

92
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,010
of the real number. Because 2 is 1/4 of 8.

93
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,100
If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.

94
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,060
But if you did it this way,

95
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,690
you could say there must be 20 managers.

96
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,430
And that would be a very fast way of solving this problem.

97
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,010
But we can also do it alegebraically.

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,330
So you could use this information to say 5 times the

99
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:37,700
workers is equal to 72 times the managers.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,380
And then you can use this information to say 5 times the

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,060
workers plus 40-- I'm just cross-multiplying, so 5 times w8--

102
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,580
is equal to 74 times the managers.

103
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,970
And now we can do some algebra. So let's subtract this from this.

104
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:04,440
Let me say minus 5w is equal to minus 72 times the managers.

105
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,940
Subtract this from this. These cancel out.

106
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,030
You get 40 is equal to 74 minus 72 is 2 times the managers.

107
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,100
So then you get the managers are equal to 20,

108
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,360
which is what we figured out the first time.

109
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,430
Maybe this is simpler for you.

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,670
And I would probably do that on the exam to make sure I

111
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,960
didn't make a careless mistake.

112
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:28,650
Next question, 171.

113
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,990
If x minus 1 squared is equal to 400,

114
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,170
which of the following could be the value of x minus 1?

115
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,450
x minus 1 squared is equal to 400,

116
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,050
so that means x minus 1 is equal to positive 20,

117
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,520
the positive square root of 400. And don't forget this.

118
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,900
This also means that x minus 1 could equal minus 20, because

119
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,450
minus 20 squared is also 400, the negative square root.

120
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,680
In this case, if you add 1 to both sides,

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,640
you get x is equal to 21.

122
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,430
In this case, if you add 1 to both sides,

123
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,000
you get x is equal to minus 19.

124
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,220
So that's what the values of x are.

125
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,880
So what can be a value of x minus 5? That's what they ask for,

126
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,030
they're not asking for the value of x.

127
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,410
x minus 5 in this case would be-- what's 21 minus 5?

128
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:30,460
That's 16, x minuse 5 in this case -19 minus 5. That's minus 24.

129
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,850
So x minus 5 could be 16, or it could be minus 24.

130
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,000
And they only have this one there, so it's choice C.

131
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,140
So they were just testing to see if you remembered that x

132
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,170
minus 1 could be the minus square root of 400,

133
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,410
the negative square root.

134
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,520
Problem 172.

135
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,790
Which of the following describes all values of x for

136
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:05,510
which 1 minus x squared is greater than or equal to 0?

137
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,060
So let's add x squared to both sides of this equation.

138
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,390
So then you get 1-- x squared plus minus x squared,

139
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,770
that zero-- is greater than or equal to x squared.

140
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm just going to switch it because that's just how I

141
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,070
think. x squared is less than or equal to 1.

142
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,350
We're dealing with real numbers,

143
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,110
so x squared is going to be a positive number.

144
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,440
So the only way that I can square a positive number and

145
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,100
have it be less than or equal 1,

146
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,580
is if x itself is less than or equal to 1.

147
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,950
Or it could be greater than or equal to negative 1,

148
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,580
because those numbers will square to being positive.

149
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,900
So x would be less than or equal to 1.

150
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,640
But it can also be greater than or equal to negative 1.

151
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,390
And you could try it. Try negative 1/2.

152
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,000
Negative 1/2 squared is positive 1/4.

153
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,140
No matter what, whether it's positive or negative,

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,660
this is going to be a positive number.

155
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,630
And the magnitude can be at most 1.

156
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,370
So that takes us from minus 1 to 1. And even 0 works.

157
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,400
So let's see if that's one of the choices. That's choice E.

158
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,010
And I'll see you in the next video.
