1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:04,328
Greece and the crisis in the European Union has been in the news for some time now,

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,471
so it's long past due that I did a video on it

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:12,141
and just so we have a time context that you might be watching this video far in the future.

4
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:14,622
This video is being done in May, 2012.

5
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:17,241
So we really don't know how all this is going to play out,

6
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:23,845
but I hope over the next few videos to lay out the potential scenarios and what might be the risks and drawbacks,

7
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,355
uh, drawbacks of each of them.

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:29,998
So this right over here, that is Greece.

9
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:33,372
And so let's just think about it on a very high level,

10
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:36,672
what the situation that they find themselves in.

11
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:38,386
So when you look at this chart right over here

12
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:41,752
the most obvious thing and it actually pops out from this top line right here,

13
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:44,821
their public debt is growing at a dramatic level

14
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,664
and their debt to GDP...this is actually the more relevant thing

15
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,586
because you might have a huge amount of debt

16
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,295
but if your GDP, if the productivity of the country is high,

17
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:54,163
that might not be that big of a problem.

18
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:58,400
What matters is how much you owe relative to how much that you can actually produce.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,534
And we see right over here the debt to GDP ratio is a percentage

20
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:05,620
so this debt is a percentage of GDP , it's well over 100%.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,165
It is well over 100% for Greece.

22
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:11,835
And you can see a large part of that is because

23
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:14,902
the public revenue, the taxes that the Greek government gets

24
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:18,272
is consistently lower than their public expenditures.

25
00:01:18,272 --> 00:01:19,772
So let me write this down.

26
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:26,903
So you have taxes. Taxes are less than spending

27
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:31,721
which lead to deficits...deficit is how much you couldn't afford,

28
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:36,044
or how much, how much spending you have above and beyond your revenues in a given year.

29
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:40,822
And so they have deficit spending on a year by year basis which increases their debt.

30
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:43,386
The debt is the total amount of money that they owe,

31
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,517
that's this top line right over here.

32
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:53,259
So this leads to increasing debt, increasing debt right over here.

33
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:55,039
But that's not the only problem.

34
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,520
Because as their debt keeps increasing,

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,856
people start to become more and more suspicious of

36
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:05,245
whether the government is actually good for their I.O.U.'s,

37
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,730
whether the government will actually pay back that debt.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,643
And so as the government's debt becomes riskier and riskier,

39
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,738
people start demanding higher and higher interest rate.

40
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:17,523
So the debt goes up. And as the debt goes up,

41
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:20,791
people think that they're not a good borrower.

42
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:25,374
So they want higher interest, interest goes up.

43
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:27,348
But now that makes things even worse,

44
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,299
because we were already running deficits,

45
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,855
we were already spending more than we were bringing in taxes,

46
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:35,488
now we have to spend even more on the interest on our debt.

47
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,398
So if you were spending 10% on your interest in one year,

48
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:41,904
so if you had $100 billion dollars, you just spend $10 billion,

49
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:45,611
now if the interest rates go to 15%, you have to spend$15 billion on that.

50
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,108
So that's going to make your spending on interest go up,

51
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:51,115
so that's going to make the debt go up even more.

52
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:54,477
So Greece finds itself in a situation like this.

53
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,144
So you might immediately say "well, you know

54
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:59,231
there's seems to be a fairly straight forward solution here.

55
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:04,728
Why don't they do some combination of increasing taxes?"

56
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:08,594
So why don't they increase taxes?

57
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:11,934
"And maybe even more importantly, why don't they decrease spending? "

58
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:17,831
Why don't they decrease spending?

59
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,290
Now the first cut is a political situation.

60
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,489
Because this spending right over here,

61
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,857
these are for the most part, these are promises to people,

62
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:27,870
these might be government obligations, these might be pensions,

63
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,529
there might be retirees that are dependent on this,

64
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,866
there could be other types of government programs.

65
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:34,593
So if you decrease that spending,

66
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:38,593
the people who are losing out on those entitlements,

67
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,278
they are not going to be too pleased with you.

68
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:42,700
So politically that's probably not the best thing to do.

69
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,247
But there might be a brave Greek leader that say

70
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,408
"well no, this is what we have to do to save the country,

71
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,238
we're willing to cut that spending."

72
00:03:50,238 --> 00:03:52,914
But that by itself, even if someone was willing to do it,

73
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:54,980
it still isn't clear whether it's a good idea.

74
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,775
Because you might have noticed this other line right over here.

75
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:01,017
This other line, "Real GDP Growth" .

76
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:05,782
Greece right over here is in a fairly severe recession.

77
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:07,097
They have a lot of unemployment,

78
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:11,693
clearly factories aren't producing at the levels that they could actually produce.

79
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,863
So if you either do some combination of increasing your taxes,

80
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:18,660
increasing the government revenue, and decreasing spending,

81
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,940
that actually will suck air out of the economy.

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,063
So this combination of things, and you've probably heard this word a lot,

83
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,895
this combination of things,

84
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:32,128
and it tends to focus on the decreasing spending in a very significant way,

85
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:37,041
this is referred to as "Austerity."

86
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,418
The word "Austere" just generally means someone who doesn't have a lot of frills,

87
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,435
they just deal with the most bare necessities

88
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,671
they really kind of cut things to the bone.

89
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,129
And so when a lot of people say "Hey Greece you have to do Austerity measures"

90
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,926
--and there's actually already been a couple of rounds of austerity measures.

91
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,510
"you need to decrease your spending in a big way."

92
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,488
But the problem is Austerity sucks money out of the economy,

93
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:07,068
and so Austerity leads to the economy slowing further,

94
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:10,829
and if the economy slows further, that actually going to hurt your taxes.

95
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:19,847
So the economy slowing makes your taxes, your actual revenue that you're getting, go down,

96
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:24,608
and that can actually make your deficits even worse!

97
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,256
Because now people say "oh my God, their economy is bad,

98
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,586
they're even less likely to be able to pay."

99
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:33,039
Interest rates go up, and since the tax revenue goes down,

100
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,090
and a lot of the spending isn't tied to the economy,

101
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,297
a lot of the spending actually goes up with the economy.

102
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:41,135
It might be unemployment insurance, it might be people retiring, pensions,

103
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:42,953
and so that can actually make things worse.

104
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:46,005
And that's actually what has happened over the last few years.

105
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:48,311
Because, and we'll talk more about this,

106
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:53,469
the Greek's were given some help from the rest of the European Union.

107
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:55,720
In exchange, the rest of the European Union said

108
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,566
"well, if we're going to help you, you gotta take some pain.

109
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:03,579
And the pain that you had to take were these Austerity measures right over here."

110
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:07,348
But these Austerity measures actually made the economy do even worse,

111
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,980
which made debt as a percentage of GDP even higher,

112
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,685
because now the GDP itself was shrinking at a even larger and larger rate.

113
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:20,202
So if you think, just all of these aspects, there was no obvious answer here.

114
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:24,999
You do Austerity, it's kind of a bad situation because that's going to hurt the economy,

115
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:28,698
you're going to become even less productive, at least in the short term.

116
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,840
And on top of that it's hugely politically unpopular,

117
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,115
to the point to where we have such high unemployment that it's becoming politically unstable.

118
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:41,399
So I'll leave you there, I'll let you mull over this situation,

119
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,067
and in the next video I'll talk about what a normal, independent country,

120
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:49,784
truly independent, both fiscally and monetarily independent country,

121
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,440
would do in a situation like this, given Greece's situation.

122
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,447
And then we'll talk about why Greece kind of can't do it in its current context.
