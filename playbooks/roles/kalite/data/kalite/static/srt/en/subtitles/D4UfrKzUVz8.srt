1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,320
So we're on problem number 9.

4
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,220
In the figure above,
AD is equal to 1.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:12,300
So AD, this distance right
here, this is equal to 1.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,290
DC is equal to square
root of 3.

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:20,680
So this distance right here
is square root of 3.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,640
What is the value of z?

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,130
And they say, no, it is
not drawn to scale.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,460
Clearly.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,180
Because this is longer than
this, but it looks the same.

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,660
OK, so they want to know
what the value of z is.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,820
So what can we figure out?

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,520
Well, the one thing that pops
out at me is these are both

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
right triangles.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,990
So this is going to deal
with right triangles.

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,490
And the first thing we
see is that these two

18
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,510
angles are the same.

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,330
So these two angles
are the same, and

20
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,580
this is a right angle.

21
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,340
   

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,120
We don't even have to know this,
but we immediately know

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,160
this is a 45-45-90
triangle, right?

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,270
Because the angles have
to add up to 180.

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,230
Two of them are the same.

26
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,580
You could say 2x plus
90 is equal to 180,

27
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,280
and solve for it.

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,750
But what you also know is that
this is an isosceles triangle,

29
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,040
where two sides are the same.

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,360
I don't know if you remember
from geometry class, if you

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,070
have a triangle like that, and
this angle is equal to this

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,380
angle, then this side is going
to be equal to that side.

33
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,300
   

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,820
I forgot what the property's
called.

35
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,930
I think it's just equal angles,
equal sides, or base

36
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,740
angles-- well, whatever.

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,700
Hopefully you remember that
term in geometry.

38
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,890
In this case, these two angles
are the base angles, so if

39
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,440
this is 1, then this
is also 1.

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,280
This BD is also going to be 1.

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,370
And this is going to be square
root of 2 or something.

42
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,000
So that now, if we look at
this triangle, something

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,250
interesting should pop out at
you, if you're familiar with

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,370
30-60-90 triangles.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,470
This side is square root
of 3 times this side.

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,440
What do we know about
30-60-90 triangles?

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,450
And you could even turn back
to page-- if you don't

48
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,790
remember, they give
it to you, right?

49
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,590
They even tell you, right
here, that on a 30-60-90

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,570
triangle, on page 423 they draw
it out for you, actually.

51
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,306
If you have a 30-60-90 triangle
like this, and this

52
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:18,640
side is 30, and this side is x,
then this side is going to

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,830
be x times the square
root of 3.

54
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,580
They literally give that to you
on page 423 when they give

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,990
you their formulas.

56
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,360
So this side is 1.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,550
This side is 1 times the
square root of 3.

58
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,070
So z must be 30 degrees.

59
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,980
It's a 30-60-90 triangle.

60
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,710
If they asked you why, this
would have been 60 degrees.

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,570
And then, if you wanted to know
what this side would have

62
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,780
been, it would have been 2, just
using 30-60-90 triangles.

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,815
All right.

64
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:53,310
Let's move to number 10.

65
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,470
Hopefully that's not
too confusing.

66
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,790
If it is, just review 30-60-90
triangles, and look at that

67
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,540
formula on page 423.

68
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,450
Number 10.

69
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:16,750
If 30% of 40% of a positive
number is equal to-- so 0.3--

70
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,990
30% of 40%.

71
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,990
So 0.3 times-- but I don't want
to use times, because

72
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,620
they want me to use
x for the number.

73
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,800
So 0.3 times 0.4-- so that's
30% of 40% of a positive

74
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:43,230
number-- so that's x,
is equal to 20% of

75
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,910
w% of the same number.

76
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:55,550
So that equals 20% of w%.

77
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:02,640
So if it's w%, then we could
write that as w/100.

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,650
So if w was 50, that'd be
50/100 or 0.5 times x.

79
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,600
Well, we can divide both sides
of this equation by x.

80
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,970
These cancel out.

81
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,089
And then we just literally
solve for w.

82
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,450
And actually, I probably didn't
even have to write it

83
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,200
as a decimal.

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,430
30% of 40% of something--
well, we can just

85
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,780
multiply the decimals.

86
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,340
What's 3 times 4?

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,130
It's 12.

88
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,585
There's two numbers behind
the decimal.

89
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:38,630
So this is 12, which
is also 12%.

90
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,980
Is equal to-- and then we
say 0.2 times what w?

91
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,790
What number?

92
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,520
Let's say times w.

93
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Well, I shouldn't write w.

94
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,910
I'm going to write this as y.

95
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,520
And I'll tell you why.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,330
Because this will give
w% as a decimal.

97
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,790
So I'm just saying 0.3
times 0.4 is 0.12.

98
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,740
And that's the same thing
as 0.2 times what?

99
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,970
Well, you divide both sides by
0.2, you get y is equal to

100
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,980
0.12 over 0.2.

101
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:19,130
And that is equal to 0.6.

102
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,320
And you could review decimals
if that didn't make a lot of

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,020
sense to you.

104
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490
So that equals 0.6.

105
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,510
So y is 0.6, or w% is 0.6.

106
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,880
So the same thing
as 0.6 is 60%.

107
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,130
So the choice is B.

108
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,070
   

109
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,390
That might seem a little
complicated.

110
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,410
And the tricky part is really
just making sure that you're

111
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,040
not using decimals and then
assuming that's a percent, or

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,660
vice versa.

113
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,250
The important thing is
we took 30% and 40%.

114
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,380
When you multiply those two
together, that's the same

115
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,410
thing as 20% times w%.

116
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,030
And I like to put it
all in decimals.

117
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,765
You could have put it all in
fractions as well, actually.

118
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:59,520
It actually probably would've
been the easiest. You would

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,770
have said, 30% is 3/10,
times 4/10 is equal

120
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:13,130
to 2/10 times w/100.

121
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,360
I took a 0 out.

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,990
You could have said 30/100,
40/100, like that.

123
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,370
And then this actually would've
been easy, because

124
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,670
you could have just taken the
100's off of both sides.

125
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,050
You said 30 times 40
is 20 times what?

126
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,010
And then you would have gotten
w is equal to 60.

127
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,900
Actually, that's how I
should have done it.

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,120
But anyway, hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,810
   

130
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,690
Next problem.

131
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,670
Notice I do these things
in real time.

132
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,640
The negative is maybe I don't
give you the most optimal

133
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,520
solution at first, but I think
the positive is that you're

134
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,960
not seeing just a
clean solution.

135
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
You're seeing how someone, the
thought process that they go

136
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,510
through when they tackle
these problems.

137
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,770
And I think that that's
actually a super

138
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,680
useful thing to see.

139
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,310
Because when you see these very
polished presentations,

140
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,580
that person did the problem
ahead of time, and so they

141
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,340
just give you the answer.

142
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,780
But they're not showing you kind
of how they stumbled upon

143
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,350
the answer.

144
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,620
So I can only hope that
this is useful.

145
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,880
All right.

146
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,410
Number 11.

147
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,750
This looks exciting.

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,025
OK, I'll switch colors.

149
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:21,810
   

150
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,030
Let me draw this thing,
and I have the perfect

151
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,940
tool to draw it.

152
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,340
Oh, no, I didn't want
it like that.

153
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,940
   

154
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,580
So a big rectangle like that.

155
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,590
And they took half
of it like that.

156
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,500
No, no, no.

157
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,830
Edit, undo.

158
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,590
I've got to go half.

159
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,992
My eyes aren't working.

160
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:46,242
It's roughly half.

161
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:50,000
   

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,360
And then they take half like
this, and then they

163
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,130
take half like this.

164
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,010
Well, they keep doing it.

165
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,380
Like that.

166
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,030
Then they take a half
like this, then they

167
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,605
take a half like that.

168
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,370
At least drawing this is fun.

169
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:08,890
OK.

170
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,580
I think this is what they have.
And then they actually

171
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,750
shade in that last one.

172
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,350
So let me shade in
that last one.

173
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,550
I shaded it in in white.

174
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,180
But anyway.

175
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,410
In the figure above, rectangle
ABCD-- that's the whole

176
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,270
thing-- is made up of seven
non-overlapping rectangles.

177
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,380
The two smallest rectangles
have the same area.

178
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,020
So these two have
the same area.

179
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,620
Each of the other rectangles
have twice the area of the

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,070
smaller rectangle.

181
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,940
OK, and it looks that way.

182
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,539
The area of the shaded rectangle
is what fraction of

183
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,220
the area of the rectangle
ABCD?

184
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,710
Well, let's just chug
through this.

185
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,810
So let me find a
suitable color.

186
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,040
So this is x.

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,990
Oh, I'm still using the
rectangle tool.

188
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,180
If this is x, and this
is going to be

189
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,020
x, this is 2x, right?

190
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,030
If this is 2x, then
this is 4x.

191
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,750
Because they say that
each larger one

192
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,540
is twice the previous.

193
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,040
So this is 4x.

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,740
So this is going to be 8x.

195
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,840
   

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,760
Am I doing this right?

197
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,900
8x.

198
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,630
And then this is going
to be 16x.

199
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,580
And then this is going
to be 32x.

200
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,210
The area of the shaded
rectangle.

201
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,080
And then, we could just
sum all of these.

202
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,790
But we also know that
this is half of the

203
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,700
entire rectangle, right?

204
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,330
This rectangle right here.

205
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,240
So the entire thing is 64x.

206
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,520
This times 2.

207
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,300
Because this makes up half
of the entire thing.

208
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,680
So the entire thing is 64x, so
x is going to be 1/64 of the

209
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,380
entire rectangle.

210
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:46,680
There.

211
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,580
That's it.

212
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,370
All right.

213
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,110
Number 12.

214
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,690
Oh, no, I'm almost
out of time.

215
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,160
So I'll do number 12
in the next video.

216
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,300
