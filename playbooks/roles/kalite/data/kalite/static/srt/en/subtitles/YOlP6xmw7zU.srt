1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
We're on problem 61.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:12,240
If 1 kilometer is approximately 0.6 miles,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,230
which of the following best approximates

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,580
the number of kilometers in 2 miles?

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,110
So we want to know 2 miles. So we could set up a ratio.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:34,350
We could say, 0.6 miles are to 2 miles as 1 kilometer

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,740
is to x kilometers.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,030
And you could cross multiply.

9
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,920
You could say 0.6 is equal to 2.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,190
And that x is equal to 2 divided by 0.6,

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,640
which is the same thing as 20 divided by 6.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,140
Right?

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:01:02,670
20 divided by 6 is equal to 3 2/6. Right? 3 1/3.

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,170
3 1/3 kilometers.

15
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,600
And that makes sense, right?

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,810
A mile is longer than a kilometer.

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,670
So 2 miles is about 3 1/3 kilometers.

18
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,360
And that's not one of the choices,

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,970
but if we wrote this as an improper fraction,

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,120
3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,530
So that equals 10/3 kilometers, which is choice A.

22
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,390
Let me do a brighter color.

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,510
I don't know if you can even see this.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,660
62. Lucy invested $10,000 in a new mutual fund account

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,580
exactly 3 years ago.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,820
The value of the account increased by 10%

27
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,820
during the first year,

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,870
increased by 5% during the second year,

29
00:01:53,870 --> 00:02:00,120
and decreased by 10% during the third year.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,230
What is the value of the account today?

31
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,560
So you start with $10,000.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,520
When you grow by 10%, that's the same thing as

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,190
multiplying by 1.1.

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,090
Right?

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,110
It's like 1 plus 0.1 times whatever.

36
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,960
So that's multiplying by 1.1.

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,870
And then you grow by another 5%.

38
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,050
That's like multiplying by 1.05.

39
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,300
And then when you decrease by 10%,

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,760
that's like multiplying by 0.9.

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,210
So we need to figure out what this is.

42
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,710
So this is a little bit of math for us to do.

43
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,880
So 1.1 times 10,000.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,170
That's at least fairly straightforward.

45
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,820
That's 11,000. Right?

46
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,360
That's how much we have after year one.

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,830
11,000 and we have to multiply that times 1.05.

48
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,570
And then we lose 10%.

49
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,640
So 11,000 times 1.05.

50
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,550
Well, just to make sure I get right,

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,940
just so I don't make a careless mistake,

52
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,390
let's actually do it. 11,000 times 1.05.

53
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,780
So 5 times 11,000 is 55,000.

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,130
And then we should add two 0's.

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,000
The 0 doesn't matter, so we add two 0's.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,340
And then 1 times 11,000 is 11,000. You add them up.

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,550
You get 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 1, 1.

58
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,230
And we have two digits behind the decimal point.

59
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,580
So we got 11,550. Which is right.

60
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,970
It would have been weird if we got 100,000

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,140
or if we got 1,000.

62
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,540
We only had a 5% change.

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,050
So then we have 11,550.

64
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,740
And now it's going to decrease by 10%.

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,780
We could multiply it by 0.9.

66
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,380
I don't know, it might be easier just to take out 10%.

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,760
Well, let's multiply it by 0.9.

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,960
9 times 0 is 0. 9 times 0 is 0.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,180
9 times 5 is 45. 9 times 1 is 9, plus 4 is 13.

70
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,050
9 times 1 is 9, plus 1 is 10.

71
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,920
And we have one digit behind the decimal point.

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,080
So it's right there.

73
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,990
So we're left with $10,350, and that is choice A.

74
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,520
Next problem.

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
63.

76
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,280
And they give us this table.

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,430
They say a computer chip manufacturer expects the ratio

78
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,840
of the number of defective chips to the total number of

79
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,640
chips in all future shipments to equal the corresponding

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,610
ratio for shipments as combined,

81
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,390
as shown in the table.

82
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,880
What is the expected number in a shipment.

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,690
OK, so let me write down what they wrote,

84
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,480
so that we see the same thing.

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,040
So shipment.

86
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,990
And they labeled them S1, S2, S3, and S4.

87
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:13,010
And they need to ask us the number of defective chips

88
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,930
in the shipment.

89
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,460
I know you can't read my handwriting.

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,050
2, 5, 6, and 4.

91
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,580
And then they say the total number of chips

92
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:39,210
in each shipment is 5,000, 12,000, 18,000, and 16,000.

93
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,300
Now let's reread the question.

94
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,530
Maybe it'll make a little bit more sense.

95
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,290
A computer chip manufacturer expects the ratio of the

96
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,130
number of defective chips to the total number of chips --

97
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,440
so that's defective to total --

98
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,570
in all future shipments to equal the corresponding ratio

99
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,660
for shipments S1 through S4 combined,

100
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,350
as shown in the table above.

101
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,040
Let me make sure I read that.

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,240
To equal the corresponding ratio for shipments S1, S2,

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,590
S3, and S4 combined, as shown in the table above.

104
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,050
What are the expected number of defective chips

105
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,480
in a shipment of 60,000?

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,910
They're saying, essentially,

107
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,200
if we take these shipments combined,

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,550
what percentage were defective?

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,950
And that's the same number we would expect to be defective

110
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,380
in a shipment of 60,000.

111
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,350
So let's figure out what percentage are defective.

112
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,990
So how many total were defective?

113
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:37,740
2 plus 5 is 7, 7 plus 6 is 13, 13 plus 4 is 17.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,040
And how many total chips did we ship? 17,000.

115
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,940
17 plus 18 is 35.

116
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:57,530
35 plus 16 is 41, is equal to 51,000 chips.

117
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,230
So we could view it a couple of ways.

118
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,310
It's 17 for every 51,000 were defective.

119
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,950
But actually, if you haven't realized it already,

120
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,750
51 is divisible by 17.

121
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,210
That's one that a lot of people miss.

122
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,330
17 times 3.

123
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,970
So then if we divide both of these numbers by 17,

124
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:22,610
we can say that 1 chip for every 3,000 is defective,

125
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,760
if we take shipments S1

126
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,920
through S4 combined. 1 chip in every 3,000.

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,460
And so if we have that same ratio for 60,000 chips,

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,390
well, how many groups of 3,000 are there in 60,000?

129
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,820
Well, there are 20 of them, right?

130
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,300
next We could say 1 in 3,000 is equal to x over 60,000.

131
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,360
And you could eyeball this to some degree.

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,910
Or you could just say, what can I multiply

133
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,420
both the numerator and the denominator by to get 60,000.

134
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,280
Well, if I multiply the numerator and the denominator

135
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,460
by 20, I get 20/60,000.

136
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,060
You could cross multiply.

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,570
There's a bunch of ways you could do this.

138
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,610
But the bottom line is you would expect 20 defective chips.

139
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,190
And that is choice B.

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,570
Problem 64.

141
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll do it in this color.

142
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,680
Let's see, they tell us that A is equal to a set of numbers.

143
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,480
I don't know what the context is yet.

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,940
2, 3, 4, and 5.

145
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,400
And they tell us that

146
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:36,960
B is equal to another set of numbers, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,620
2 integers will be randomly selected from the sets above,

148
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,730
1 integer from set A and 1 integer from set B.

149
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,030
What is the probability

150
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:54,770
that the sum of the 2 integers will equal 9?

151
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,550
So let's think about all of the combinations that equal 9.

152
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,340
Right?

153
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:18,310
If I pick 2 from this, I have to pick 7 from here, right?

154
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,500
If I pick 3 from this set, I have to pick 6 from here.

155
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,140
If I pick 4 from this set, I have to pick 5 from here.

156
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,660
And if I pick 5 from this set, I have to pick 4 from here.

157
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,740
Right?

158
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,250
So no matter what,

159
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,230
I'm going to pick one of these numbers from set 1.

160
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,270
It's going to be 2, 3, or 4 or 5.

161
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,230
And depending which of these I pick,

162
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,560
I have to pick the exact right number from set B.

163
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,820
So think of it this way.

164
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,680
I don't know what I've picked in set A, right?

165
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,550
I don't know.

166
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,680
Let's say we've picked one of them.

167
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,140
We don't know which of these we've picked.

168
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,540
And we know that exactly one of these is going to be

169
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,860
the right number to add to whatever we've picked to equal 9.

170
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,330
And we have to pick that exactly right one.

171
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,200
And we're going to be picking it out of

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,730
a selection of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 numbers.

173
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,800
So we have a 1 in 5 chance of having them add up to 9.

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,260
And 1 in 5 is the same thing as 0.2, which is choice B.

175
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,520
I hope that makes sense.

176
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,780
You could say, look, I don't care what I pick from set 1.

177
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,520
I could pick any of these,

178
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,550
and in order for it to add up to 9,

179
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,240
no matter what I pick from here, there's a 1/5 chance

180
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,720
that I picked the right corresponding number that

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,100
adds up to 9 there.

182
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,160
Because each of these have only one.

183
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,020
If I pick 3, I have to pick 5, right?

184
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:42,280
So if I pick 2, I have to pick 7.

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,890
If I pick 3, I have to pick 5.

186
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:54,270
If I pick 3, I have to pick 6.

187
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,400
If I pick 4, I have to pick 5.

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,900
And if I pick 5, I have to pick 4, right?

189
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,280
And so you could say,

190
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,320
well, the chances of each of these are 1/5.

191
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,090
Actually I'm not going to go down that road.

192
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,680
All you have to say is that just overly complicates it.

193
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,190
All you have to say is, look,

194
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm going to pick one of these.

195
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,090
And once I have one of those in my hand,

196
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,910
there's a 1/5 chance that I picked the exact one that

197
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,850
adds up to whatever I just picked to equal 9.

198
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,670
And the answer is B.

199
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,900
And now I'm out of time.

200
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,030
See you in the next video.
