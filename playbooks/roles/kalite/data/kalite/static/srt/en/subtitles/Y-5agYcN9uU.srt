1
00:00:00,678 --> 00:00:02,896
Hi. This is Sez Zabelin.

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:04,349
And I'm Max Newbold.

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,270
We are Second Life correspondents for Smart History.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,294
And here we are once again in the recreation of the Sistine Chapel,

5
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:12,466
on Vassar's campus,

6
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:16,175
and we're going to talk this time not about the ceiling,

7
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:18,712
but about the fresco that Michelangelo painted

8
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:24,986
on the wall behind the altar in the Sistine Chapel, about 25 years later,

9
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,299
- after the ceiling -

10
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,338
- after the ceiling,

11
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:27,948
"The Last Judgment."

12
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:31,770
"The Last Judgment," and from 1534 to 1541.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,852
So, this one took about 7 years.

14
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:37,707
Now, this was actually a commission that came from not Julius II,

15
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:38,666
- No, he's dead.

16
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,045
- Right. But from two popes, actually.

17
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:42,467
It was Clement VII who had sort of arranged

18
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:45,755
for the back wall to be painted, the wall -

19
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,813
which is really critical, because it's directly

20
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:51,405
in back of and above the altar, the high altar,

21
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,285
where the Pope himself stands -

22
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:54,975
That's right.

23
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:56,965
- and addresses the cardinals. I mean,

24
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:59,128
there is no more sacred space, really.

25
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,146
Yes. Uh, it was Paul III who did the final commission, is that right?

26
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,743
- who comes right after Clement VII, that's right.

27
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:06,831
Okay. This is a very, very old subject.

28
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:09,163
It's one of the oldest subjects.

29
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:13,449
It's the Last Judgment; it's when Christ returns to the earth,

30
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,440
the time of the Second Coming,

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,109
and judges all of mankind

32
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:21,076
and separates on his left,

33
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:23,443
those who have sinned, who will go to Hell;

34
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:27,298
and those on his right, the blessed, who will go to Heaven.

35
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:31,707
So we need to think about this in terms of Christ's left and Christ's right,

36
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:34,478
as he separates the blessed from the damned.

37
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,796
So, this subject is probably the single most terrifying subject

38
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,863
that one could expect to see in the Catholic tradition

39
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:46,461
and, in fact, interestingly, it is often a subject that is painted or carved

40
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:51,710
directly over the exit of a church, so that when you leave -

41
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,795
- sometimes an entrance, but very often over an exit,

42
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:56,556
so that when you leave the church,

43
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:59,912
it's the last thing you see before you go back into the world,

44
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,665
because you know, of course,

45
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,792
everybody is full of good intentions in church,

46
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,537
but walking back into the real world,

47
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:08,057
one needs a good dose of fear,

48
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,753
and this would really provide that.

49
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:11,304
"Sin, and you will burn in hell."

50
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,900
That is basically the message of "The Last Judgment."

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,108
But you said a moment ago that it's important to understand this painting

52
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:21,397
within the context of the historical, the political context of the day.

53
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:25,220
This is being painted, again, in 1534, 1541,

54
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,890
and Europe is in turmoil at this moment.

55
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,551
Yes.

56
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,556
And the Catholic Church itself is threatened to its core.

57
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,629
It is. About 20 years before this was painted,

58
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,017
Luther nailed his "95 Theses" to a door of a church -

59
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,382
-In Northern Germany -

60
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:43,845
-in Northern Germany, quite far away, but -

61
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,905
- but Luther was a Catholic priest.

62
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:46,631
Yes.

63
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,301
But he was forcing a kind of reform.

64
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:51,798
Within the Church, yes.

65
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:55,594
And pointing to very specific practices within the Catholic Church

66
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:58,388
that he believed were corrupt.

67
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,408
Interestingly, and ironically perhaps,

68
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:03,407
practices that helped finance Julius II

69
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:05,462
and Michelangelo's earlier commissions -

70
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,604
-right, and the rebuilding of the church of St. Peter's. Right.

71
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,719
That's right. But that's another story.

72
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,033
Yes. So, the Church is in turmoil, really,

73
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,627
the period that we've been describing is the High Renaissance,

74
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,932
this embrace of the human body,

75
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:19,679
of classical antiquity;

76
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,555
that period is really over.

77
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:23,599
The Church is under attack.

78
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,207
And it's important to see this fresco in the context of an embattled church.

79
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:32,909
This is a painting that is full of a kind of anger,

80
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,966
and fear, and I think you're right.

81
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,643
I think this notion of a kind of context that is absolutely threatening

82
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:43,900
will make sense because gone is so much of the optimism

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,965
and so much of the beauty -

84
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:45,612
-the ideal beauty -

85
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,436
- that Michelangelo renders on the ceiling,

86
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,717
and instead you have a kind of absolute aggression.

87
00:03:51,717 --> 00:03:53,669
Look at Christ himself in the center.

88
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:56,349
Here we have Christ who is not paying attention

89
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:59,616
to the blessed. His attention is focused on the damned.

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,295
To his left, yes.

91
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:03,306
That's right. And his hand is raised, you can actually see the stig-

92
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:06,679
you can see the holes where, which he received on the cross.

93
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,468
But he's about to smite the damned into Hell.

94
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,098
And it looks as though with his left hand,

95
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,675
he's pointing to his own wounds that he received on the cross,

96
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:20,529
as though he's saying, "I suffered. Now those who have sinned will suffer."

97
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,512
-will suffer as well.

98
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:21,856
Right.

99
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:27,406
It's almost Mary, who's under his arm, who is actually attending, in this painting, to the blessed.

100
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:32,010
But cowering beneath him, as though she can no longer help anyone.

101
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,033
And no longer protect -

102
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,398
She can no longer intercede for mankind.

103
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:36,515
Ah. That's really important.

104
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:38,219
Now, Michelangelo is still Michelangelo,

105
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,294
and he's still rendering Christ with a kind of massiveness

106
00:04:41,294 --> 00:04:43,011
that is an expression of his divinity.

107
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:43,601
Yes.

108
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,244
And it's almost over the top here, almost Mannerist, actually.

109
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:46,840
It's true.

110
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,839
And it's almost, almost like Marvel Comics, in a sense.

111
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,047
I mean, look. It's muscle upon muscle in that torso.

112
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,387
Yes, as he strides forward.

113
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:56,721
Now, on either side of Christ are saints

114
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,673
and other, you know, important Old Testament figures.

115
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:02,275
And this is traditional. And in fact,

116
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,332
when we say left and right,

117
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,134
we mean lower left and lower right.

118
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:06,978
That's right. It really doesn't -

119
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:09,771
this is Heaven, when we're at this level.

120
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,049
And so the left, right don't really accord.

121
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,887
Right. And so, some of the figures that we see there,

122
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,609
besides Mary crouching under Christ's arm,

123
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:22,992
we see St. Lawrence, for example, holding the grill that he was burned on -

124
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,863
We see St. Peter, who's looking furious.

125
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,092
- we see St. Peter with the keys -

126
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,240
- He's got this key -

127
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,986
And this is just slightly to the bottom right of Christ.

128
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:34,551
To his left, we see a large figure of St. Bartholomew,

129
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,733
one of the most grotesque images rendered in this painting.

130
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:42,097
Yes. St. Bartholomew, as many early saints were,

131
00:05:42,097 --> 00:05:44,879
was martyred in a really hideous way,

132
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,456
and Bartholomew was flayed. He was skinned alive.

133
00:05:48,456 --> 00:05:51,347
And he's actually holding his own skin-

134
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,110
- In his left hand.

135
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,717
- as he holds the knife in his right, and looks up to Christ.

136
00:05:55,717 --> 00:06:00,024
Right. So he holds, as most saints do, generally, the instruments of his martyrdom.

137
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:03,946
But it's so graphically rendered, to hold his own skin,

138
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,392
which just hangs down, is extraordinary.

139
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:09,864
And of course, there is a theory -

140
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:12,420
- in the skin of St. Bartholomew -

141
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,718
- that the face that is rendered in the skin

142
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:18,534
is actually a self-portrait of the artist.

143
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,298
I think it's not - I guess it's a theory,

144
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,771
but it's - I think it's something we're pretty sure about,

145
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:24,558
because that really looks like Michelan-

146
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,321
I mean, we know what Michelangelo looked like,

147
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:29,847
we know that Michelangelo had a kind of deformed bridge of his nose -

148
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,054
-that curly brown hair -

149
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:33,833
- it really looks exactly like Michelangelo there.

150
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,190
And it's an extraordinary idea to begin to contemplate,

151
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,881
what Michelangelo would have meant

152
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,476
to render himself in this lifeless skin.

153
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:45,719
And in the place where he's put himself.

154
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,739
So let's come back to that.

155
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:48,446
Okay.

156
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:51,669
So let's talk for a minute about the figures in "The Last Judgment,"

157
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,815
because we've talked about how that ideal beauty

158
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,246
is gone, and here Michelangelo's really,

159
00:06:57,246 --> 00:07:00,615
it seems to me, moving away from that idea of

160
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,707
beauty as a connection to the Divine,

161
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,105
and as a way to get to the Divine,

162
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,838
and is instead portraying figures who are

163
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:09,284
sometimes quite ugly.

164
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:12,801
Ugly, and also their limbs are no longer graceful,

165
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,242
but akimbo. It seems this painting is full of activity,

166
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:19,952
but it seems as if so often, there's a kind of almost violence,

167
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:26,371
or almost a kind of chaos in the way in which the figures link together

168
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,234
and the movements of the limbs between them.

169
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:33,390
And their, you know, their bodies are sometimes, you know, a little bit almost deformed;

170
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,645
their heads are too small;

171
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:38,112
they don't have those lovely, harmonious proportions

172
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,447
like the figures on the ceiling.

173
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,808
And it's almost as though, it's always seemed to me that

174
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:47,796
Michelangelo's saying, "This is not a celebration of human beings anymore.

175
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,055
This is a work of art -"

176
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,922
- or of human beings' relationship to -

177
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:51,545
to God.

178
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,999
- to God, that's right. This is -

179
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:57,970
-This is a painting where the message is primary;

180
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,049
and he's going to do what he has to do to the figures,

181
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:04,634
to the composition, to make sure that that message,

182
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,632
which is, "Sin, and you will burn in Hell.

183
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:10,059
Leave the Church, betray the Church,

184
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:12,033
and you will burn in Hell for eternity."

185
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,227
It is a grotesque . . .

186
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,225
So this is an extraordinarily modern idea.

187
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,973
It will take hundreds of more years

188
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,774
for artists to be comfortable with the idea of

189
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:22,044
deforming the body in order to express -

190
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,339
- a message. Yes.

191
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,006
- a more total message. This is a very modern idea, in that sense.

192
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,186
Yes. And I think it's perfectly seen in the figure of St. Catherine,

193
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:31,392
who is holding a wheel, who bends forward.

194
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:34,273
Her head is too small, her arms are kind of grotesque;

195
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:37,224
the position of her body is so awkward;

196
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:40,053
there's just nothing beautiful and graceful about her,

197
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,792
and we can say that about so many of the figures here.

198
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,825
And one other thing that I'd like to talk about

199
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,799
with the figures of the saints, who surround Christ,

200
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:51,824
you know, Michelangelo, when he was painting these figures, he said,

201
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:56,737
wanted to show these saints to sow the seeds of faith.

202
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,152
And I think that showing these figures

203
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,893
who died these really terribly painful deaths -

204
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:06,368
St. Lawrence, St. Sebastian who died by being pierced with arrows,

205
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,972
St. Catherine who died on a wheel,

206
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:12,240
these men and women who gave their lives

207
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,252
and suffered so, simply for their faith in Christ,

208
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,271
that this idea that, one can believe,

209
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:23,340
one can, you know, through anything,

210
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,874
through all of these tests, one's faith in Christ -

211
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,112
- can persevere. One wonders then,

212
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,890
- can persevere, even in the face of death and suffering.

213
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,649
One wonders if that was a question that Michelangelo himself,

214
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,584
in his older age, is beginning to ask of himself.

215
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:42,010
Yes. And I think it's a question for this moment in time.

216
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,653
It is. Given the war, the suffering, the violence,

217
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,731
that is surrounding the Church at this time.

218
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:47,416
Right, right.

219
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,713
Let's take a look at some of the figures that are

220
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,641
a little bit lower down,

221
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:52,944
and that really speak to the narrative of the Last Judgment itself.

222
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:56,076
In some ways, we have to begin really

223
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,561
with the group of figures immediately below Christ -

224
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,236
- the angels?

225
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:03,101
- the angels blowing their golden trumpets as loudly as possible,

226
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:07,200
almost looking like - like you know, with their cheeks bulging out -

227
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,987
- to awaken the dead from their graves.

228
00:10:08,987 --> 00:10:11,358
That's right. And if we look a little bit to the lower left

229
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:14,667
of those trumpeting angels, we can actually see Michelangelo's . . .

230
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,500
- or Christ's right.

231
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,880
- Christ's right, in those green hills -

232
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,385
we can actually see the dead being resurrected,

233
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:24,415
these spirits, these skeletons, that are musty

234
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,939
and rising from the dead.

235
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,737
It's a fabulous, almost literal rendering.

236
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:31,820
And then as they move up, angels reach down -

237
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,382
these wingless, seemingly male angels -

238
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,921
reach and grab them as they float up -

239
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,200
- Look at the group that are being pulled up by the rosary!

240
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,743
- and pull them up toward Heaven.

241
00:10:41,743 --> 00:10:43,413
Right. As though Michelangelo's saying,

242
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,750
by prayer, by the strength of prayer, one can get to Heaven.

243
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,397
By prayer. But, it's Michelangelo, so it's tangible and physical,

244
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,705
and it seems as if that angel has to be

245
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:54,004
enormously physically powerful,

246
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:56,068
to actually defy gravity and pull them up.

247
00:10:56,068 --> 00:10:58,316
There's strain and effort here.

248
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,062
Yeah. And then on the other side,

249
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:01,941
Christ's left or our right,

250
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:05,373
we have the figures who are damned to Hell.

251
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,326
Ah. And instead of the angels pulling them up,

252
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:11,154
we now have the angels with their fists -

253
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:12,165
-punching them down!

254
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,396
- beating them down!

255
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:16,226
And these figures who are trying to claw their way up,

256
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,144
who angels force back down.

257
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,478
Even as the devils below begin to claw at them

258
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,939
and to pull them down into Hell.

259
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,067
I know. It's fabulous, isn't it?

260
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,098
So, being pushed and pulled.

261
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:30,037
But probably the most memorable figure among this group

262
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:31,703
is that damned man.

263
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,912
The one who's just realized which way he's going.

264
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:38,253
The sense of human torment, the pathos in that face,

265
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:40,694
is extraordinary. There is there,

266
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:44,896
not only sadness and fear, but recognition of his own failings.

267
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:50,199
And to me, this sort of symbol of the human condition,

268
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,566
you know, that no matter how good we try to be,

269
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:57,219
no matter how good our intentions,

270
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,080
no matter how much we can see what is right,

271
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,091
we often do what is wrong;

272
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:08,870
but at this moment of reckoning, on this day of Christ's Second Coming,

273
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,339
we are judged and the decision is rendered.

274
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:19,170
And his expression so beautifully crystallizes that moment of recognition,

275
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,387
of all of that truth.

276
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,010
Yeah.

277
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,917
Once you get down to Hell, of course,

278
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:28,643
you don't go directly to Hell. You have to be ferried there. And Michelangelo -

279
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,048
In a kind of classical mythology.

280
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:35,412
That's right. Which is reiterated, in a sense made permanent, by Dante's "Inferno."

281
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,766
We have Charon, the ferryman,

282
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:42,899
who is beating the souls off of his boat to the shores of Hell,

283
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,651
because of course, they're incredibly reluctant to go.

284
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:52,210
But they're also assisted by devils whose pitchforks are harvesting those souls and bringing them down.

285
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,121
And pulling them in.

286
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:55,040
But perhaps my favorite -

287
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,640
-the far right bottom?

288
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,102
That's right. My favorite element in the painting

289
00:12:59,102 --> 00:13:04,173
is the story just down at the bottom, where we see Minos,

290
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:07,556
who has a great serpent wrapped around his waist.

291
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:12,062
Vasari tells a great story about this little vignette.

292
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:16,042
According to Vasari, Michelangelo wanted very much

293
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:18,636
for the Pope not to bring visitors in as he painted.

294
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:22,531
But on one day, the Pope brought Biagio da Siena [sic],

295
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:24,270
a very high-minded man,

296
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,270
who Vasari calls a Master of Ceremonies,

297
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,683
in to see Michelangelo's nearly completed painting.

298
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:35,701
And the Pope asked Biagio, "What do you think?"

299
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:39,760
Well, he said quite directly, and in front of the artist,

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,926
this is totally inappropriate for the chapel of the Pope.

301
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:46,024
Too many nudes.

302
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:51,406
Too many nudes. This is appropriate for a tavern, not for the Vatican.

303
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:52,777
Michelangelo didn't like that.

304
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:54,657
But Michelangelo had his revenge.

305
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:57,742
And as soon as Biagio da Siena [sic] left with the Pope,

306
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:01,630
Michelangelo painted his face from memory in -

307
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,944
- [chuckling] on the face of the Satanic figure down in the lower right.

308
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,204
Yes, who is being devoured by a serpent.

309
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,260
Yes. He got his revenge!

310
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,957
He certainly did.

311
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:12,463
Michelangelo often got his revenge.

312
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:18,229
He did. So, now let's go back to where Michelangelo chose to put his self-portrait,

313
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,486
because I think that it's interesting.

314
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:24,998
He's sort of, you know, he's in that area right to the -

315
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,447
- on that same level as Christ,

316
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:29,444
so he's with the saints and other important figures.

317
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:32,038
But he's sort of hovering dangerously

318
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,873
over this lower left area.

319
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,686
It's not that he's just hovering dangerously,

320
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:40,327
It's that - it's that Bartholomew himself

321
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:43,433
doesn't seem to be paying much attention to the skin,

322
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:46,562
and he holds it rather nonchalantly, as if he might just-

323
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,299
- drop it.

324
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:49,570
- let go. And if he let go,

325
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,615
that skin would fall directly into the boat of Charon,

326
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,296
and would be transported to Hell.

327
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:57,985
Right. And it also looks to me like he's sort of midway,

328
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:02,905
that skin is sort of midway between the saving power of Christ

329
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,948
and the figure who - the damned -

330
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:07,144
the figure we refer to as the damned man,

331
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:09,602
who has just realized that he's going to Hell,

332
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:13,577
clearly indicating Michelangelo's own uncertainty,

333
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,670
which we also know from his poetry during this period,

334
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,311
the uncertainty of the fate of his own soul,

335
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:22,656
whether he would when he died -

336
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,824
because he's an old man by now,

337
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,368
although he would live much longer -

338
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,754
go to Heaven when he died, or go to Hell.

339
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:29,330
And obviously Michelangelo's great fear

340
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,875
is that he would go to Hell,

341
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,364
and Michelangelo, I think, even at this time

342
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:36,219
looking up at the ceiling that he had painted 25 years earlier,

343
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:38,808
and wondering if that early work

344
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,831
that celebrated human beings and the human body,

345
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:45,796
and was not so obviously in the service of the Church,

346
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:46,908
would somehow -

347
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:48,482
- damn him.

348
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:52,966
- damn him, or - not be - helpful on that day of judgment.

349
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:54,391
- you know, I see - it makes sense to me,

350
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:57,588
and I think actually that argument is strengthened

351
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,390
by the fact that Michelangelo chose to render himself

352
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,718
as an empty shell, as a skin,

353
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:05,545
because you used the term soul -

354
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:08,644
what direction Michelangelo's soul.

355
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:10,684
There is no space for soul here.

356
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:11,534
That's true.

357
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:13,158
In a sense, could this be a kind of indictment

358
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:16,749
as you spoke of, that he has spent his life creating fictions,

359
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:17,435
- that's right.

360
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,414
that he has spent his life creating,

361
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:23,575
in a sense, the outermost skin, a likeness -

362
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,240
- celebrating -

363
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,201
-but without substance. Right?

364
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:30,560
Because here we have no interior, no soul, no substance.

365
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,555
Is that what he's done?

366
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:35,495
When we saw him bring . . . breathe life into stone,

367
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,823
was that real life?

368
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:40,121
No, not as God creates life. But . . . but . . . but . . .

369
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,161
Right. And yet there's a kind of pride.

370
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:44,426
A falseness, a false pride, yes, and it must have been -

371
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:45,317
- Michelangelo as the Creator.

372
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:48,628
And his nickname, of course, is "Il Divino," "The Divine One."

373
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:52,556
And so, is this Michelangelo in his later life

374
00:16:52,556 --> 00:16:56,525
beginning to rue, in a sense, his braggadocio?

375
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:58,134
To rue his -

376
00:16:58,134 --> 00:17:00,514
- his pride, in his own creations.

377
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:03,197
These were the very questions that the Church itself were beginning to ask.

378
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:06,882
The Reformation, I think, caused a tremendous questioning,

379
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:10,278
and we see it here in the microcosm of one man's life;

380
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,531
but I think it was a set of questions

381
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,658
that the Church as a whole was beginning to grapple with.

382
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,670
Yeah. How does one get to Heaven?

383
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,108
Is the Church the only one way to get to Heaven?

384
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:24,350
Are the, you know, the Sacraments,

385
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,865
do they do what they said they would do, is the -

386
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,553
- Is the pomp and ceremony of the Church essential?

387
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:30,455
Or is it in some way a bar?

388
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:34,192
Right. Or is it about a more personal relationship with God?

389
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,589
Is it about prayer?

390
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,463
These are all questions that I think absolutely inform this painting,

391
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:44,467
and thus make this painting an expression of the Reformation,

392
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,947
and the Counter-Reformation, that will develop -

393
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:52,926
- and this - this moment of religious questioning, and turmoil.

394
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,799
This is a painting that is all about turmoil.

395
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,485
Yes.
