1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,630
Let's play the angle game.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,170
So I've drawn this crazy figure
here and I'm going to give you

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,590
a couple of angles and then I
want you to figure

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,950
out another angle.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,350
So let me give you some angles.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:24,970
So let's say that this angle
up here is 56 degrees.

7
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:38,108
Then I also tell you this angle here is 115 degrees.

8
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:46,016
What I would like you to figure out -- this is the object of

9
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:50,040
the angle game -- I want you to
figure out what this

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,606
angle is - right here.

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,313
If you are brave, you can pause the video and try to

12
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:00,997
figure it out yourself.

13
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,815
If you would like me to walk
you through it -- and maybe I

14
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,520
can give you a couple of steps
and then you pause it and you

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,970
get the rest of it by yourself.

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,410
But I will now show you
how I would have solved

17
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,810
this in the angle game.

18
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,370
You have all the tools
necessary to already solve it.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,420
I want you to be able to get
good at this, because this is

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,800
kind of like the key
skill on the SAT.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,080
Oh, I didn't give you a key
piece of -- you're probably

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,560
saying I can't solve this.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,250
You probably can't because
I haven't given you a key

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,760
piece of information.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,510
This line here and this line
here, so this line and this

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,130
line, they're parallel.

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,330
I was telling you to solve
it before giving you a

28
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,290
key piece of information.

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,120
That means that
they are parallel.

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,740
So what can we do this figure?

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,500
So whenever I see these type of
problems, either while playing

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,890
the angle game or on, say, an
SAT, I just literally kind of

33
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,320
figure out every angle that I
can figure out and slowly try

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,570
to make my way to
the goal angle.

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,950
Let's see what we can
figure out here.

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:58,080
So I'm going to do it in this
blue-green color anything

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,070
that I can figure out.

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,260
So this angle is 56
degrees, right?

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,700
These lines are parallel.

40
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,781
This line here looks like a transversal -- a transversal!

41
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,464
So what do we know about it?

42
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,685
Well, let's see, what's a corresponding angle to

43
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,420
this angle right here?

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,830
Well, it's the angle, right?

45
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,248
What do we know about
corresponding angles for

46
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:23,848
parallel lines when you have a transversal?

47
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,710
That's 56 degrees.

48
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:30,375
56 degrees - right? Because corresponding angles are equal.

49
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,768
We could have done a
lot of other stuff.

50
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:33,730
We could have figured out that
this angle is 56 degrees, but

51
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,430
that probably wouldn't have
gotten us closer to our goal.

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,150
That angle's 56 degrees and
its corresponding angle

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,580
is also 56 degrees.

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,460
That wouldn't have gotten
us any closer to our goal.

55
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,910
We could have figured out that
this is 180 minus 56, right,

56
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,710
which is, what? 124 degrees.

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,270
That really wouldn't
have helped us much.

58
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,540
I'm showing you, these are all
things that you can do while

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,870
playing the angle game.

60
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,380
But anyway, the first step
-- I said well, these are

61
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,810
corresponding angles,
so that's 56 degrees.

62
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,160
So let's see, I need to figure
out this angle right here.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,720
I know this one, and they're
in a triangle, right?

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
You see this triangle.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,008
If only I knew this angle.

66
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,032
Can you figure out this angle?

67
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:22,410
Well, it is supplementary to
this 115 degrees, right?

68
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:24,924
So this green angle plus this purple angle

69
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:29,393
is equal to 180. So this is 180 minus 115.

70
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:33,570
So what's that? 180 minus -- so this
is 65 degrees.

71
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,002
So what have we done so far?

72
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,060
We just said well these
are parallel lines, so

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,010
corresponding angles are equal.

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,900
So this 56 degrees is
equal to this 56 degrees.

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,240
Then we said, well, this green
angle and this purple angle are

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,110
supplementary, so they
have to add up to 180.

77
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,010
So this is 115.

78
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,870
But this is 65, which
is just 180 minus 115.

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,690
I think you might see
where I'm going now.

80
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,640
Now we know two angles
of a triangle.

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,440
If we know two angles of a
triangle, what can figure

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,960
out about the third?

83
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,870
Well, we know the angles of a
triangle add up to 180, right?

84
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,210
So let's called this x.

85
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:23,350
We know that x plus 56
plus 65 equals 180.

86
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,210
What's 56 plus 65?

87
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,635
This is where I always
mess up, on the addition

88
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:28,820
and the subtraction.

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,340
So, 5 plus 6 is 110.

90
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,713
This is 121 I believe.

91
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:39,798
121, right? ... right, 121 equals 180.

92
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,160
Then x is equal to --
let's see, 180 minus

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,040
20 is 60, so it's 59.

94
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,462
x is equal to 59 degrees.

95
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,701
There we go.

96
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:59,215
We have accomplished our first
goal in the angle game.

97
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,321
There you saw it.

98
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:03,005
So let's do a tougher
angle problem.

99
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,536
This one maybe won't involve parallel lines.

100
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:11,400
But I just want to show you,
everything really just boils

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,280
down to everything we learned
about parallel lines and

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,340
triangles and angles
adding up to each other.

103
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,811
So this one involves a star.

104
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,730
Let me draw the star.

105
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,959
So, let's see -- a line from there to there.

106
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,405
Draw a line from there to there.

107
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:33,362
Draw a line from there to there.

108
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,515
Draw a line from there to there.

109
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,840
Draw a line from there to there.

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,510
What do we know about this?

111
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,400
We know that this angle
is 75 -- oh boy, I'm

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,410
using the wrong tool.

113
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,750
This angle is 75 degrees.

114
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,280
We also know that this
angle is 75 degrees.

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,300
We know this angle
here is 101 degrees.

116
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,640
Your mission in this angle
game is to figure out

117
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,920
this angle right here.

118
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,910
What is this angle?

119
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,030
This is a good time to
pause because I will now

120
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,550
show you the solution.

121
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,560
So what can we do here?

122
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,230
So this angle, well jeez, I
just like to just mess around

123
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,690
and see what I can figure out.

124
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,800
So, if this angle here is
101 degrees, what other

125
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,880
angles can we figure out?

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,550
We could figure out -- well, we
could figure out this angle.

127
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,540
We could figure out
a bunch of angles.

128
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,640
We could figure out that -- let
me switch the color, these

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,720
are my "figure out" angles.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,010
So that's 101, then this
is supplementary, that's

131
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,110
79 degrees, right?

132
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,190
That's also 79 degrees because
this is also supplementary.

133
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,100
This angle right here is
opposite to it, so this

134
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,487
angle right here is
going to be 101 degrees.

135
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:54,372
What else can figure out?

136
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,510
We could figure out this angle
because it's supplementary, we

137
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,910
could figure out this angle.

138
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,700
We could also figure out this
angle because we see this

139
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,380
triangle right here.

140
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,860
This angle plus 75 plus 75 is
going to equal 180, right?

141
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,180
So let's call this
angle b, b for blue.

142
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,910
So b plus 75 plus 75 is
going to equal 180.

143
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,050
And I'm just using this
triangle right here.

144
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:33,200
So b plus 150 is equal to 180,
or b is equal to 30 degrees.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,960
So we're able to
figure this out.

146
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,366
Now, what will you do if I told you that

147
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,280
we are now ready to figure out this yellow angle?

148
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,260
It might not be obvious to you.

149
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,965
You kind of have to look at the
triangle in the right way, and

150
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,850
the SAT will do this to you
all the time, all the time.

151
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,170
That's why I'm testing
you this way.

152
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,740
Well, let me give you a little hint:

153
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
Look at this triangle.

154
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,717
Non-ideal color, let me do it in red so it really stands out.

155
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,590
Look at this triangle.

156
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,290
I'll tell you, the hardest
thing about these problems is

157
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,140
just looking at the right
triangle and kind of seeing

158
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,260
that oh wow, I actually
can figure out something.

159
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,800
Look at this triangle
right here.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,380
We know this angle
of it, 101 degrees.

161
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,040
We know this angle, we
just figured it out,

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,970
it was 30 degrees.

163
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,210
So all we have left is to
figure out this yellow

164
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,313
angle, call it x.

165
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:35,490
So x plus 101 ... plus 30 is equal to 180 degrees because

166
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,430
the angles in a triangle
add up to 180 degrees.

167
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,222
So x plus 131 is equal to 180.

168
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,300
x is equal to what?

169
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,580
49 degrees.

170
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,190
There you go.

171
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,520
We've done the second
problem in the angle game.

172
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,230
I think that's all of the time
I have now in this video.

173
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,100
In the next video maybe I'll
do a couple more of these

174
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,600
angle game problems.

175
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,030
See you soon.
