1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,400
Let's try to evaluate seven and six-ninths minus three and two-fifths. So like

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,349
always I like to separate out the whole
number parts from the fractional parts.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:11,099
This is the same thing as

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,419
seven

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,039
plus six-ninths minus three

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,040
minus

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,289
two-fifth.

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,180
And the reason why I'm saying minus
three minus two-fifths

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,740
as this is the same thing as minus three
plus two-fifths.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,789
So you distribute the negative sign: subtracting at three and then you're

11
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,020
subtracting the two-fifths.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,590
And so now we can worry about the whole
number parts: seven

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,369
minus three.

14
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:41,320
Well, seven minus three is going to give
us

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,990
four. So that's going to give us four. And then
we're going to have six-ninths

16
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:46,900
minus

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,280
two-fifths.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,340
So let me think about what six-ninths minus two-fifths are.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,000
Six-ninths minus two-fifths. Well we're gonna have to find a common denominator. So this is

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,230
going to be the same thing and I think
the least common multiple of nine and five is

21
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,210
going to be forty-five. Literally them
multiplied. They have no common

22
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,200
factors.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
So it's going to be over forty five,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,200
till from nine to forty-five to multiply
by five so I'm gonna have to multiply the numerator by

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,990
five.

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,460
So six times five is thirty.

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,689
And I'm gonna subtract,

28
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,689
to go from five to forty-five have to multiply by nine,

29
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,490
so have to multiply the numerator right nine
if I don't wanna change the values.

30
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,480
So two times nine is

31
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,540
eighteen.

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,909
And thirty over thirty forty-fifth minus
eighteen forty-fifths is going to be

33
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,530
something over forty-five. Thirty minus
eighteen is twelve.

34
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:37,620
So this is - if I subtract
these two fractions right over here -

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,020
I get twelve,

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,030
twelve forty-fifths.

37
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,220
So it's four plus twelve forty-fifths,
or if we want it to write it as a mixed number,

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,260
this is equal to four and twelve

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,240
fourty-fifths.

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,400
But we're not done yet! We can simplify
this further: twelve and forty-five have

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,770
common factors.

42
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,049
They're both divisible by,

43
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:59,520
they're both divisible by three!

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
So we can say that this is,

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,460
actually they are both divisible by that while we
continue to divide more after that.

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,820
So let's see if we divide the numerator by three

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,310
and the denominator

48
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,829
by three.

49
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,400
We end up with four and twelve divided
by three

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,909
is four.

51
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,419
And forty-five divided by three,

52
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:21,639
forty-five divided by three is fifteen.

53
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,430
Four and four-fifteen, so actually we're done!

54
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,129
These two can't be simplified anymore.

55
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,029
Four and four-fifteenths.
