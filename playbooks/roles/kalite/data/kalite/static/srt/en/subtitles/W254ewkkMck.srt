00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,900
Welcome to the presentation
on finding sums of integers.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,670
You're probably wondering why
are we doing this within

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,150
the context of averages.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,240
Well, if you think about it,
all an average is is you take

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,030
a sum of a bunch of numbers
and then you divide by the

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,930
number of numbers you have.

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,770
What we're going to do here is
do a couple of algebra problems

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,230
that involve just the sum parts
first, and actually they can

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,570
carry over into average
problems as well.

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,360
Let's get started
with a problem.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,800
Let's say I told you that I had
the sum of five consecutive

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:48,580
integers is equal to 200.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:56,005
What is the smallest -- I
apologize for my handwriting

14
00:00:56,005 --> 00:01:03,300
-- what is the smallest
of the five integers?

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,750
Well there's a couple of ways
to do this, but I guess the

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,760
most straightforward way is
just to do it algebraically,

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,080
I would say.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,315
So let's say that x is the
smallest of the integers,

19
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,650
right, so x is actually
what we're going to want to figure out.

20
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:24,804
Well if x is the smallest, what
are the other four going to be?

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,090
We have a total of five.

22
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,580
Well, they're consecutive.

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,620
Consecutive just means that
they follow each other,

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,100
like 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,040
All of those are consecutive
integers, right?

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,140
And if you remember, integers
are just whole numbers, so it

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,110
can't be a fraction
or a decimal.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,420
So if x is the smallest, so
then the next integer is

29
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,260
going to be x plus 1.

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,360
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 2.

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,400
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 3.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,050
And the one after that's
going to be x plus 4, right?

33
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,150
It might seem confusing I'm
writing all of these x's.

34
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,920
But if you think about it, if x
was 5, then this would be 6,

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,030
this would be 7, this would
be 8, and this would be 9.

36
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,150
And that's all I'm
writing here, right?

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,960
So these would be, assuming
that x is the smallest of the

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,350
integers, the five integers
would be x, x+1, x+2, x+3, and x+4.

39
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,907
And we know that the sum
of these five consecutive integers is 200.

40
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:27,112
What is the sum of these
five, I guess we could say, numbers or expressions?

41
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:30,670
Well let's see, we have
five x's -- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,662
So x plus x plus x plus x
plus x is equal to just 5x.

43
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:38,920
Or you could just
say 5 times x.

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,540
And then that's plus 1
plus 2 is 3, 3 plus 3

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,600
is 6, 6 plus 4 is 10.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,490
So the sum of these five
integers is going to be 5x plus

47
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,520
10, and all I did is add up the
x's and added up the constants.

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,450
And we know that that
is going to equal 200.

49
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,330
Now this is just a level
two linear equation.

50
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,440
We can just solve for x.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,050
So we get 5x is equal to 190
-- I just subtracted 10 from both sides, right?

52
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:15,090
And then x is equal to --
let me divide 5 into 190.

53
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,870
5 goes into 19 three
times, 3 times 5 is 15.

54
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,160
9 minus 5 is 4,
bring down the 0.

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,500
5 goes into 40, eight times.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
So x is equal to 38.

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,054
Pretty straightforward
problem, don't you think?

58
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:38,775
Now what if I were to ask you
what is the average of the five consecutive numbers?

59
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:41,020
Well now, there's two
ways of doing this.

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,250
Now that we already know that x
is 38, we know that the other

61
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:52,130
numbers are going to be -- well
this is 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.

62
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,960
Well we could just average
these four numbers.

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,900
You could just say 38 plus
39 plus 40 plus 41 plus 42.

64
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,360
And well we already know
what those -- I don't

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,060
even have to do the math.

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,320
You already know that they
average up, they sum up to 200

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,860
and then we divide the sum by
5, because there are 5 numbers.

68
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,310
So the average is 40.

69
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,488
There are a couple ways you
could think about that.

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,420
One, you see 40's just a middle
number so that makes sense.

71
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,230
And the only time we can really
say it's the middle number

72
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,800
is when the numbers are
distributed evenly around 40.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,620
If we had a number that was
much smaller than 40 or

74
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,747
something, you couldn't
just necessarily pick the middle number.

75
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:32,090
But in this case these are
consecutive and makes sense.

76
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,230
Another way we could have done
this problem, if you were, say,

77
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,840
taking the SAT and they were to
ask you the sum of five

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,500
numbers is 200, what's the
average of the numbers?

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,800
Well you say, well, all I have
to do is divide that 200

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,270
by 5 and I'll get 40.

81
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,700
Let's do another problem
and I'll make it a

82
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,070
little bit harder.

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:08,540
Let's say the sum of seven odd
numbers, and let me make up a

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,060
good -- I hope this one works,
I'm going to try to do it in

85
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:27,535
my head -- is 217, what
is the largest number?

86
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:35,627
I shouldn't say number
-- seven odd integers.

87
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,210
Actually it becomes a much
harder problem if it was just

88
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,840
seven odd -- well actually, the
only thing that could be odd

89
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,900
are integers anyway, so you
could almost assume it.

90
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,400
But the sum of seven
odd integers is 217.

91
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,160
What is the largest
of the integers?

92
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,200
As you can tell I'm
doing this on the fly.

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,750
Actually my wife just diagnosed
me with, she thinks I

94
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,030
have benign vertigo.

95
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,490
I got very dizzy this morning
when I went to work, so you

96
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,850
have to forgive me
for that as well.

97
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,010
That's impairing me even more.

98
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,080
So let's do this problem.

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,339
Let's say that x
is the largest.

100
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,449
Then what would the
number right below x be?

101
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:16,550
Would it be x minus 1?

102
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,990
Well, if x is an odd
number, x minus 1 would

103
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,750
be an even number.

104
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,850
So in order to get the number
right below it, we have to

105
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,290
do x minus 2 to get
another odd number.

106
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,630
My apologies -- it should
say the sum of seven

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,170
consecutive odd.

108
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,160
I don't know if
you assumed that.

109
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,130
I'm trying my best
today to confuse you.

110
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,840
The sum of seven consecutive
odd integers is 217.

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,530
What is the largest
of the integers?

112
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,420
So if x is the largest, then to
next smallest one would be x

113
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,030
minus 2, right, because it's
consecutive odd numbers,

114
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,250
not just consecutive.

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,020
So consecutive odd numbers are
like 1, 3, 5, 7 -- you're

116
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,050
skipping the evens, right?

117
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,470
So that's why you're going up
or down by two, depending

118
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,740
how you view it.

119
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,345
So the next one down would be
x minus 2, then we'll have x

120
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:13,450
minus 4, x minus 6, x minus
8, x minus 10, x minus 12.

121
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,060
I think that's it.

122
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,700
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, right.

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,060
Those are seven numbers.

124
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,300
They're separated by two.

125
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,990
X is the largest
of them, right?

126
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,210
We can assume that they're
odd because apparently

127
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,310
the problem will work
out so that they're odd.

128
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,320
So what is the sum of
these seven numbers?

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,850
Well the seven x's
just add up to 7x.

130
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:38,630
And then let's see, 2 and 4 is
6, 6 and 6 is 12, 12 and 8 is

131
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,330
20, 20 and 10 is 30,
30 and 12 is 32.

132
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:51,840
So 7x minus 32 is equal to 217.

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
We just solved for x.

134
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,310
7x is equal to -- let's see,
if we add 32 to both sides

135
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,380
of this equation we get 249.

136
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,020
Let's see, 7 goes into
249 -- is that right?

137
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,737
Right.

138
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,685
So 7 goes into 249 -- did I
do this addition properly?

139
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,070
I want to make sure.

140
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:28,770
2 plus 4 is 6, 6 plus 6 is 12,
12 plus 8 is 20, 20 plus 10

141
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,820
is 30, 30 plus 12 is 42.

142
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,210
Oh, here you go.

143
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,320
See, my mathematical spider
sense could tell that something

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,090
was fishy about this.

145
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,470
So that's 7x minus 42.

146
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,870
So if we add 42 to both sides
it's 7x is equal to 259.

147
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,900
See how brave I am, I do
this thing in real time.

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,680
259.

149
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,530
So 7 goes into 259 -- let's
see, 7 goes into 25 three

150
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:01,900
times, 3 times 7 is 21, 49 --
it goes into it 37 times.

151
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,530
So we get x is equal
to 37 and we're done.

152
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,630
So just to review because I
think had a lot of errors in

153
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,460
this problem when
I presented it.

154
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,907
The question was the sum
of seven consecutive odd integers is 217.

155
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,830
What is the largest
of the integers?

156
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,390
I said x is the largest, and
then if x is the largest, the

157
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,650
next smaller one
will x minus 2.

158
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,140
Because we're not saying
just consecutive integers,

159
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,010
we're saying consecutive
odd integers, right?

160
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,320
So if x is 37, which is what we
solved for, then x minus 2 is

161
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,490
35, this is 33, this is 31,
this is 29, this is

162
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,490
27, this is 25.

163
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,050
And then we just added up all
the x's and I'll add up all

164
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,910
the constants and said,
well they add up to 217.

165
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,600
And then we just solved for x.

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,460
I think you're now ready to
try some of these problems.

167
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,940
Have fun.
