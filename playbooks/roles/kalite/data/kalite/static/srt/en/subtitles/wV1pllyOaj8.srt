1
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:07,715
I've drawn out for you a mother over here,

2
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:10,227
a mom, and her son on the right.

3
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:13,570
And it turns out that mom has tuberculosis,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,286
let's assume that.

5
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:16,984
And sometimes when you see "Tuberculosis"

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,796
written out the way I'm writing it out,

7
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:20,903
you'll actually see it shorthanded,

8
00:00:20,903 --> 00:00:23,159
or kind of use the quick way of saying it,

9
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,757
which is two letters: TB.

10
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:27,430
So let's say mom has TB.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,769
Now, this is actually a diagnosis, right?

12
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,902
This is a description of her illness.

13
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:35,239
This is telling us what she actually has,

14
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,745
what she is sick with.

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,241
But we have to remember that tuberculosis is

16
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:41,812
actually caused by an organism.

17
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:44,415
It's actually caused by a bacteria, it turns out.

18
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:50,992
And this bacteria has the name "Mycobacterium".

19
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:54,190
Mycobacterium Tuberculosis.

20
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,160
So this is actually a very easy one to remember,

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,145
because "tuberculosis" is right here in the name.

22
00:00:59,145 --> 00:01:01,599
Now I should point out Mycobacterium Tuberculosis

23
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:05,471
is actually not the only cause of tuberculosis.

24
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,440
It turns out there are few other kind of related

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,016
mycobacterium, using this word "myco", that also cause TB.

26
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,113
But this one, the one I wrote out for you,

27
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:18,450
this is definitely the most common around the world,

28
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,084
and that's the one I'm going to focus on.

29
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:23,789
And in fact this "myco", this is actually Greek

30
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,896
for the term "fungus".

31
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:28,764
And the reason that this is here actually kind of tells us

32
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,995
a little bit about how this bacteria grows,

33
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:34,999
because it grows really slowly, like a fungus,

34
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,981
and that's actually the reason that they use the term "myco".

35
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,374
But nevertheless it is a bacteria, and so if we're going to

36
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:43,199
put a little bracket around the diagnosis,

37
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,979
I also want to put a little bracket around this part,

38
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:48,314
to kind of distinguish the two.

39
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:51,148
So now you can see very clearly TB,

40
00:01:51,148 --> 00:01:53,736
the diagnosis is caused by a bacteria.

41
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:56,920
So now let's talk about how mom, who we said already

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,921
is sick with TB... I'm going to actually just

43
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,563
sketch out what her lungs might look like,

44
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,661
assuming that the TB is in her lungs.

45
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,563
This is actually the most common place we think of

46
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:09,332
with TB, but not the only place.

47
00:02:09,332 --> 00:02:12,336
But let's say that she's got little red, I'm going to draw it

48
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:15,818
in red, bacteria here in her lungs, causing her to be

49
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,410
very, very sick with tuberculosis.

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,180
She could spread it to her son.

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,478
But what are the different ways that she might spread it?

52
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,230
What are the most common ways?

53
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,290
Well, let me sketch out a few possibilities,

54
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,758
and we're going to go over whether these possibilities

55
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:35,236
are very likely or unlikely to be a way for her

56
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,894
to spread disease to her son.

57
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:41,979
Let' say first they are sharing this delicious pizza

58
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,923
I'm drawing here. Let's say they are very into pizza

59
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:48,826
and they like to share food, and they both chow down

60
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:51,519
on this little pizza here, that's one way they might

61
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,064
potentially you might think of as a way to spread it.

62
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:57,370
Maybe they're even sharing a drink.

63
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,461
Maybe there is a drink here, and they are sharing again.

64
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:03,171
You might also think about what's going on

65
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,107
in their house: maybe they're opening and closing doors,

66
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:08,475
and maybe they're touching door knobs,

67
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,278
there is another way, right, maybe they're touching stuff

68
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,619
in common. Maybe she says to him:

69
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,648
"Hey, here, grab these keys" and she's been holding

70
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,757
the keys all day, and then she gives him the keys

71
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:21,422
and he holds the keys.

72
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,824
There is another way, maybe the TB can touch objects

73
00:03:23,824 --> 00:03:27,161
in the environment, like a door knob or a key.

74
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,098
And then there's the most obvious way

75
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:30,765
you might be thinking: maybe she's coughing,

76
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,301
maybe she has a loud cough, maybe she's coughing

77
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:36,874
all day and some of these bacteria get in the air.

78
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,144
That's another way that you might imagine that the

79
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:42,143
bacteria could spread from her to her son.

80
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:44,873
So different ways, right. Now, of these ways,

81
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:47,116
I'm actually going to label this one over here,

82
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:48,750
let's say this is through the air.

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,088
Which are the most common ways to be really concerned

84
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:53,654
about TB spreading?

85
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,901
I'm actually going to just put it in green,

86
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,360
so it really sticks out.

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,900
The most common way is what we call

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,265
"Person to person through the air".

89
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,403
So in this case the first person would be mom,

90
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:04,771
because she is sick, and it's going to go

91
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:07,159
through the air, down to her son.

92
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,806
And these other ways, for example food and drink,

93
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:12,842
that's really not so common, that's really really unlikely

94
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,276
to be a way of spreading TB and in fact,

95
00:04:15,276 --> 00:04:18,229
even this down here is really not likely either.

96
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:21,329
So the idea of getting TB by sharing food and drink

97
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,954
or touching objects in your environment

98
00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:26,353
like the keys or the door knob, or things like that,

99
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:29,525
that's really not how TB spreads usually.

100
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,222
Usually it spreads through the air.

101
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:33,648
And one person, the sick person is usually coughing a lot,

102
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,931
and then the other person might breathe it in.

103
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,801
So let me make a little bit of space on this canvas

104
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,402
and let's talk about what happens next.

105
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:44,005
I'm going to draw one alveolus here,

106
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:46,561
and I'm going to copy it a few times just so you can see

107
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:50,146
a few different possibilities in terms of what might happen,

108
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:53,015
and these represent the son's alveoli.

109
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:56,116
These are the son's alveoli.

110
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:58,622
And of course these are the tiny little air sacks

111
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:01,856
at the very ends of the bronchial tree, right?

112
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,327
So we'll make a few copies of this.

113
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,097
There we go, we have four possibilities:

114
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,330
Possibility 1, 2, 3 and 4.

115
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,270
Basically, we'll go through different scenarios,

116
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,569
different things that might happen when mom coughs.

117
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,107
So maybe she coughs and the first possibility could be

118
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:21,542
that the bacteria just don't get far enough,

119
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:25,017
they don't actually make it to the son,

120
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:27,114
and he never ends up breathing them in.

121
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:30,356
So if this was the case, there would be no bacteria

122
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:33,781
in his alveoli, of course his lungs are nice and clean,

123
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:37,157
let me draw his lungs in, they look nice and clean,

124
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:41,329
with no bacteria, and he's feeling great.

125
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:45,657
Right, this is our son over here feeling really good,

126
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:48,105
and we would say basically in this case,

127
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,866
in scenario one, he's healthy, because the bacteria

128
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:53,741
never even got to his lungs.

129
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,243
Now, Scenario 2.

130
00:05:55,243 --> 00:06:00,248
Let's say that the cough actually was very strong

131
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,780
and he was close by and he ended up breathing

132
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,808
some of these in through his nose or his mouth

133
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:07,628
and they went down into his lungs.

134
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:09,952
That's another possibility.

135
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,026
Once the bacteria get there, let me actually draw them

136
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:16,150
on this little alveoli, in possibility number 2,

137
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,901
they might actually get picked up by little immune cells.

138
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:23,005
So he has little cells that are patrolling the lungs,

139
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,055
making sure they are nice and clean and healthy,

140
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,247
and these little immune cells, we'll label them over here,

141
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:33,052
these are Macrophages, this literally means

142
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,084
"Big eater", because "phage" means "to eat",

143
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:40,025
so these immune cells, they might come by and gobble up

144
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,643
these bacteria, and take them in, and destroy them.

145
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:45,859
That's another possibility.

146
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,550
So that would be possibility number two.

147
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,532
So here the bacteria are gone.

148
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,145
Now let's play it out again.

149
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,602
And let's say in Scenario 3 also you have a couple

150
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:57,337
of bacteria in here, and just as before, you got a couple

151
00:06:57,337 --> 00:07:01,948
of immune cells that come by, and they swallow up these

152
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:04,811
little bacteria, these are the macrophages I'm drawing,

153
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,282
swallowing up the bacteria, but let's say that

154
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:13,321
unfortunately in Scenario 3, now, these macrophages,

155
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:17,618
for whatever reason, cannot destroy the bacteria.

156
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:20,132
The bacteria is still living, and that's why I draw them here

157
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,929
as little red dots. They are still living, still there.

158
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:26,080
And now let me draw the fourth scenario,

159
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,138
which is again let's say a couple of bacteria get in,

160
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:34,443
and the immune cells again get alerted, and they come by,

161
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:36,778
and pick up one of them, maybe thÃ®s immune cell is

162
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:41,062
trying to go after this other one, maybe it's really close by,

163
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,068
but here the key difference is that these bacteria

164
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,570
are actually multiplying, so I'm going to draw lots of them.

165
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,708
These bacteria are multiplying and they're filling up

166
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,243
this space. So this space is filling up with

167
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:55,571
little tiny red bacteria.

168
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:57,114
So the key difference here is that

169
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,153
these ones are multiplying.

170
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:01,900
And we didn't really talk about the other scenarios

171
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,087
having bacteria that are multiplying.

172
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,524
But now, that's the key new thing here.

173
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:09,829
And in this scenario, we'd call it "Active"...

174
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:14,434
because you're actually seeing the bacteria thriving,

175
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:18,676
we call this "Active TB infection".

176
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:20,999
And that goes back to what we would label

177
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:24,501
the other scenarios, these ones, and these ones together,

178
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:30,942
we actually call both of them "Latent TB infection".

179
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:33,245
And the reason I'm putting them together is because

180
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:40,089
it's very hard clinically to distinguish Scenario 2

181
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,195
from Scenario 3, because in both cases,

182
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:47,428
the immune system has previous experience with

183
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:50,801
the TB bacteria, it's seen the TB bacteria,

184
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:54,337
and in both cases you're not seeing lots and lots

185
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:57,510
of bacteria dividing or multiplying,

186
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,445
so we lump these together and call them both

187
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:02,214
"Latent TB infection".

188
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:05,181
The real key, and this kind of the take home that I want

189
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:07,582
to point out, is that there is difference then between

190
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:10,246
"healthy", someone that's really never seen TB

191
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:14,225
in their life before; "Latent", where you have seen TB

192
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:17,649
previously, but you don't have any bacteria

193
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:20,731
that are multiplying; and "Active TB infection",

194
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,924
where you have lots and lots of

195
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:24,740
TB bacteria that are multiplying.

196
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,797
Let me make just a little bit more space then.

197
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:29,713
I'm going to focus now on just this final one,

198
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:34,226
this multiplying, active TB infection situation.

199
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:37,031
So if, let's say, our son in this case,

200
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:40,484
gets tuberculosis from mother, from mom,

201
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:42,652
and let's say unfortunately he has an

202
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:46,274
active TB infection, what are some clues

203
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,618
to tell us that he has an active infection?

204
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,979
If I'm trying to figure out if somebody has TB,

205
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,551
I always think about two key things:

206
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,291
What are their symptoms? What are they sick with?

207
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,913
That's the first thing.

208
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,356
And then: How long is it going on for?

209
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,299
I'm going to call that "Duration".

210
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:05,970
And these two offer really really helpful clues

211
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,089
to figure out if someone has TB.

212
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,974
And with symptoms, I'm going to break it up into

213
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:15,124
two categories. The first is "Constitutional",

214
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,649
and this is constitutional symptoms, and this is

215
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,417
the things that affect the whole body.

216
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,719
The whole body, so I'm going to put a little bracket

217
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:25,573
on the entire body to remind us of that.

218
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:29,039
And this could be things like fevers or chills,

219
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,029
you can't really point to one part of your body

220
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,832
and say "This is the part that's having fevers and chills".

221
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:37,136
You'd say just generally "I feel awful".

222
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,582
This could be things like night sweats if you wake up

223
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:43,440
and your t-shirt is all wet, you might say

224
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,644
those are night sweats.

225
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,083
Another example of a constitutional symptom

226
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,912
is weight loss, particularly when you are not trying

227
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:52,351
to lose weight, especially because you are

228
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,328
maybe not eating as much, or you're vomitting.

229
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,615
Anything like that...

230
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:01,058
And now the other category is "Lower repiratory tract".

231
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:05,908
"Respiratory" I'm going to abridge it to "Resp." tract.

232
00:11:05,908 --> 00:11:08,471
And this, if I want to draw it, it would basically be

233
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:11,072
the part I've drawn in blue here.

234
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:13,604
So going down from your voice box all the way

235
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:17,328
to the alveoli. This would be your lower respiratory tract.

236
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:19,418
And you can think about what sort of symptoms

237
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,414
you might have there.

238
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,337
It could be things like coughing, that would be coming

239
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,554
from the lungs. If you're coughing very hard,

240
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,917
you might have some blood or some little

241
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,128
streaks of red that are blood in your sputum,

242
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:33,126
so it could be bloody sputum.

243
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,460
That would be another one.

244
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,411
The sputum of course is just the mucus stuff

245
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,096
that you cough up.

246
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,134
And a lot of people that aren't coughing this much,

247
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:43,268
they might have trouble breathing, or chest pain,

248
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:44,335
anything like that.

249
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:46,963
So these are just some examples of

250
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,595
lower respiratory tract symptoms.

251
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:50,875
And so I always think in my head:

252
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,932
"Are they having constitutional symptoms?"

253
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:55,212
If so, I put a check there.

254
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:58,427
"Are they having some lower respiratory tract symptoms?"

255
00:11:58,427 --> 00:11:59,822
If so, I put a check there.

256
00:11:59,822 --> 00:12:01,490
And then "How long is it going for?"

257
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,456
And usually with things like active TB infection,

258
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:09,860
I'm thinking it's got to be usually more than 3 weeks.

259
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,362
So more than 3 weeks.

260
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:14,035
And this is again focusing on TB of the lungs,

261
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,639
or the pleura, which is a space around the lungs,

262
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,970
generally the symptoms have gone on for a little while.

263
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,594
So these then become very helpful clues

264
00:12:22,667 --> 99:59:59,999
to figure out if someone actually has active TB infection.
