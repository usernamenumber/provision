1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,590
We're on problem 17.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,240
The sum of three consecutive
odd integers is 111.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,920
That's what they tell
us at the top.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,810
I won't write that.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,440
If n represents the least of the
three integers, which of

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,900
the following equations
represents

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,010
the statement above?

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,610
So n is the least of the
three integers, so

10
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,040
let's say that's n.

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,440
So it's the least of three
consecutive odd integers.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,970
So what's the next odd
integer going to be?

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,080
It's not going to be n plus 1,
because n plus 1 is going to

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,110
be an even integer, right?

15
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,430
If this was 3 then the next odd
integer's going to be 5,

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,870
which is going to be n plus 2.

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,470
And then the next one above that
is going to be n plus 4.

18
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,240
And you can try it out.

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's say that n was 3, and
this is 5, and this is 7.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,460
That's three consecutive
odd integers.

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,820
And they're telling us
that the sum is 111.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,900
So the sum is 111.

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,870
What's the sum of these
three terms?

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,400
Well, you add up
the three n's.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,110
n plus n plus n is 3n.

26
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,380
And then 2 plus 4, 3n plus 6.

27
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,500
And that's going to
be equal to 111.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,060
And that is choice D.

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,640
Maybe I just confused you
how I wrote this.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
All I did is I said that's the
same thing as n plus n plus 2

31
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,640
plus n plus 4, which is
equal to 3n plus 6.

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,890
Next problem.

33
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:30,300
   

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,160
Problem 8.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,150
And they do this arc.

36
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,720
It looks something like that.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,920
It actually looks better
than what I just drew,

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,190
but you get the point.

39
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,030
So there's like a distance of 2,
and then there's a distance

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,700
of b, it looks like.

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:53,800
So it's 2 then b then 2 then
b then 2 then b again.

42
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,630
The figure above shows part
of a circle whose

43
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,660
circumference is 45.

44
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,260
So the circumference of
the circle is 45.

45
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,600
If arcs of length 2 and length b
continue to alternate around

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,509
the entire circle, so this is
just part of the circle and

47
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,889
they just keep going
around the circle.

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,470
They just keep going around the
circle so that there are

49
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,020
18 arcs of each length.

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,990
What is the degree measure of
each of the arcs of length b?

51
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,690
So they say there's 18
arcs of each length.

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,880
They say that there are 18 of
these arcs of lengths 2, and

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,690
there's 18 of these b segments
because they're saying this

54
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,620
is-- well, they drew
this as part of the

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,300
whole circle, right?

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,050
So that means that if the entire
circumference is 45,

57
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,385
but in terms of 2's and b's, we
know that there's 18 2's ,

58
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,660
so it's 18 times 2.

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,990
And then we also know that there
are 18 b's, plus 18b.

60
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,940
This is another way of writing
the circumference of the

61
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,540
circle. because they say that
the circumference is made of

62
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,660
18 of these arcs and 18 of these
b arcs here, so this is

63
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,270
also equal to the circumference
of the circle,

64
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,890
which they told us is 45.

65
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,500
Now let's see, this is 36.

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,800
18 times 2 plus 18b
is equal to 45.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,260
Subtract 36 from both sides.

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,900
You get 18b is equal to 9.

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,710
b is equal to 9/18, which
is equal to 1/2.

70
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,070
Now what are they asking?

71
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:33,310
What is the degree measure of
each of the arcs of length b?

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:40,190
So we know that each b is 1/2.

73
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,760
And actually, you know what?

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,720
We could have gone
to this step.

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,180
We could have said that 18 b's--
well, no, actually, this

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,680
is-- each b is of length
1/2, right?

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,410
So what fraction is that of
the entire circumference?

78
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,120
This length right here is 1/2.

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,370
That's what we just
solved, right?

80
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,840
You saying there's going to be
18 b's and 18 arcs of length 2

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
and they all add up to 45.

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,715
We solve for b.

83
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:05,770
It's 1/2.

84
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,910
We want to figure out what's
the degree measure.

85
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,600
So to figure out the degree
measure, we say, well, 1/2 is

86
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,230
to the circumference of the
entire circle, which is 45, is

87
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,000
equal to the degree measure over
the total degrees in the

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,460
entire circle, because the
fraction in terms of the

89
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,520
circumference is the same thing
it's going to be in

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,430
terms of degrees as a fraction
of 360 degrees.

91
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,680
Why?

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,320
Because there's 360 degrees
in the circle.

93
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,010
So let's cross-multiply this.

94
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,690
1/2 times 360 degrees, so you
get 180 degrees-- that's 1/2

95
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,020
times 360-- is equal to 45x.

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,130
So x is equal to 180
divided by 45.

97
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,780
And what's 180 divided by 45?

98
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,740
Let's see, 40 goes into 160,
it's 4 times, right?

99
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,730
x is equal to 4.

100
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,540
4 times 45, right?

101
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,450
So x is equal to 4 degrees.

102
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,690
And that's choice A.

103
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,230
That also makes sense
intuitively.

104
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,970
4 degrees is a very small amount
of degrees, so that

105
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,190
makes sense if you were
going from the center.

106
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,270
I know what I just drew just
probably confused you.

107
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,290
Hopefully, you get the idea.

108
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,620
Figure out how long the b's
are and then what fraction

109
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,430
that is of the entire
circumference and then that's

110
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,120
what fraction it is
of 360 degrees.

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,830
Problem 19.

112
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,090
The cost of maintenance on
an automobile increases

113
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,190
each year by 10%.

114
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,340
And Andrew paid $300 this year
for maintenance on his

115
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,080
automobile.

116
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,110
Fine.

117
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,620
If the cost c for maintenance on
Andrew's automobile n years

118
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,680
from now is given by the
function, so c of n is equal

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,230
to 300x to the n, what
is the value of x?

120
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,860
So they say every year the
cost increases by 10%.

121
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,130
So what does it mean
to increase by 10%.

122
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,150
Let me say the cost in year 1,
let's say the cost in year 1

123
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,350
is going to be-- what's
the cost in year 2?

124
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,040
It's going to be the cost of
year 1 increased by 10%.

125
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,710
So plus 0.1 times the cost in
year 1, which is equal to 1.1

126
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,410
times the cost in year 1.

127
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,320
The cost in year 3 is equal to
1.1 times the cost in year 2,

128
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,830
which is the same
thing as what?

129
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:35,630
1.1 times the cost of year
2, which is this.

130
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,620
1.1 times 1.1, cost of year
1, which is the same

131
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,210
thing as 1.1 squared.

132
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,900
So every year that you go out,
you're essentially just taking

133
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,070
1.1 to that power of how many
years you're going out.

134
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,240
Actually, I should probably make
this cost of year 0, make

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,620
this cost of year 1, 0, 0, 0.

136
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,956
This is probably confusing you,
but cost of year 2, so

137
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:05,020
then the exponents at least
match up: 1 and then 0.

138
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,500
Then the exponents match up.

139
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,450
The cost of year 2 is 1.1
squared times cost of year 0.

140
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,790
So as you can see, all we're
doing when we're doing this,

141
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,290
this is kind of an exponential
growth problem.

142
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,540
But they're just saying
what is this base?

143
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,440
But when you increase something
by 10%, you're

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,080
essentially multiplying
it by 1., so

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,510
that's all they're asking.

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,330
So that's choice C.

147
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,580
Next problem.

148
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,490
   

149
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,341
They drew this parallelogram,
which I have not drawn well.

150
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,670
It gets the point.

151
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:49,910
   

152
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:57,060
A, B, C, D.

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,720
If the five line segments in
the figure above are all

154
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,930
congruent-- OK, so the five
lines, these are all

155
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,940
congruent, so they're all
equal to each other.

156
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,530
all of those sides, what
is the ratio of the

157
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,990
length of AC, not drawn?

158
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,870
So they want to know AC,
so that's this length.

159
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,560
They want to know
AC to length BD.

160
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,160
All right.

161
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,270
So all of those lines
are congruent.

162
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,480
You know what?

163
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,590
Let's just pick a number.

164
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,290
That's what I find to
be easiest when

165
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,260
they tell us it all.

166
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,669
So let's just say that this
is 1, this is 1, this

167
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,990
is 1, this is 1.

168
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,510
This whole thing is
going to be 1.

169
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,590
So how long is this and this?

170
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,830
This will bisect this
line, right?

171
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,230
I think we know that about
parallelograms that the two

172
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,450
lines bisect each other,
the two diagonals.

173
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,466
So this is going to be 1/2, and
this is going to be 1/2.

174
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,730
And there's also something
else we know.

175
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,900
We know that this is 60 degrees,
this is 60 degrees,

176
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,710
that this whole angle is 60
degrees, this whole angle is

177
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,280
60 degrees.

178
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,010
And how do we know that?

179
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,770
Before we drew the green line,
we knew that both of those

180
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,980
triangles are equilateral
triangles.

181
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,610
So if this whole angle was 60
degrees, then this angle right

182
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,410
here is going to
be 30 degrees.

183
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,870
And I think you see where
I'm going with this.

184
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,980
This is a 30-60-90 triangle
where this is 1-- that's the

185
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,610
hypotenuse-- this is 1/2.

186
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,960
And then what is the side
opposite the 60-degree side,

187
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,915
which is this?

188
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:41,896
The square root of 3 times
this side right here.

189
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:45,520
The square root of 3/2.

190
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,250
And so would this one.

191
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,500
This one would also be
square root of 3/2.

192
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,350
I know maybe it's a
little confusing.

193
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,360
Actually, I'm about to run out
of time, so I will continue

194
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,110
this in the next video.
