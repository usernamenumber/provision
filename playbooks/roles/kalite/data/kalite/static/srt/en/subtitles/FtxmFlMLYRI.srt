1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:03,226
When you want to make a circle,

2
00:00:03,226 --> 00:00:05,938
how is it done?

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:08,620
Well you probably will start with

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,083
the radius one.

5
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:14,313
Then use a compass or a string

6
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,797
and use a paper or the ground

7
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,845
and if the radius is one,

8
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:25,207
how far did you go around?

9
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:35,334
It's Tau, 6.28, yeah it's Tau, 6.28318

10
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:41,677
5307

11
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,755
17958...

12
00:00:47,677 --> 00:00:50,271
If you pick a certain distance

13
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,423
and you pick a certain spot

14
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:55,096
and you put the two together ,

15
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,080
then what have you got?

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,493
It makes a very special shape

17
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,780
and now you are the inventor

18
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,819
if you take all of the points

19
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:06,364
a certain distance from your center

20
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,722
and you've got a great collection

21
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:11,420
and it is a great invention

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,541
and it makes a lovely circle,

23
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,639
well depending on dimension.

24
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:18,043
Cause it's 1, 2, 3,

25
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:20,197
then there's 4 and even more,

26
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:23,085
but for a circle, how much circle's there

27
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:27,135
if you take the distance, and compare...

28
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:32,242
It's Tau, 6.28, yeah,

29
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:37,135
it's Tau, 6.28318

30
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:45,626
530717958

31
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,738
647692528...

32
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:01,087
I know what you are thinking,

33
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,341
what about that other guy,

34
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:06,209
the one that's sometimes pronouced "pee"

35
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,060
and is sometimes pronounced "pie".

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,606
I mean it's fine if you are building,

37
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:13,868
but does not belong in math.

38
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,032
All the equations make more sense

39
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:18,375
when you use "taw", you use "taff",

40
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,092
and while you get the same answers

41
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:22,930
no matter which way,

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,882
we get further from truth

43
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:27,343
when we obscure what we say.

44
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:29,437
Know that math makes sense

45
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,616
when it's beautiful and pure.

46
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,600
So please don't make it ugly with

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,242
your bad notation and awful curriculum.

48
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:43,731
Use Tau, 6.28, yeah

49
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:48,606
use Tau, 6.28318

50
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:56,822
530717958
