00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:06,734
Let's see if we can shed some light on the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which is also one of the most

2
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:14,071
confusing aspects of taxation in the U.S. but hopefully this video will clarify things a little bit. So

3
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:19,226
let's go back to the example from the first video of the person making a $100'000 and what I am going

4
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:25,733
to do is calculate the AMT, the Alternative Minimum Tax for that person and we will see what happens

5
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:32,800
from there. So Alternative Minimum Tax, for someone making $100'000 so what I've drawn right over here, this

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,533
applies if you make less than $300'000, the first $47'000 or so is exempt, when you're calculating the

7
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:47,800
alternative minimum tax. So for this person making a $100'000, we're just going to consider a balance

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:01:09,242
above $47,450 So a $100'000 minus $47,450 would be $52,550.
