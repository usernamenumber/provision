1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,190
We're on test 8, section
5, page 855.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,830
Problem 1.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:15,720
If x over x minus 2 is
equal to 39 over 37,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,520
then what does x equal?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
And here you could try to solve
this situation, but

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,130
there's just a pattern here
that you could actually

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,370
identify immediately.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,400
If x is 39, then what
is x minus 2?

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,080
x minus 2's going to be 37.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,110
So you could immediately just
try out these numbers.

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,920
That just kind of struck
you because 37 is

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,495
two less than 39.

14
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:35,750
x minus 2 is 2 less than x.

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,450
So x must be 39.

16
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,450
You could do that problem
really fast.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,420
If you don't understand what I'm
saying you could kind of

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,800
solve it with the traditional
method, cross multiply.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,190
You could say 37 times
x, 37x is equal to 39

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,810
times x minus 2.

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,190
   

22
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:04,379
So you get 37x is equal to 39x
minus, what is that, minus 78.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,510
And then you could subtract 39x
from both sides and you

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,990
get minus 2x is equal
to minus 78.

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,400
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get x is equal to 39.

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,310
But that would have taken
a lot of valuable time.

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,040
The first problem with any
section on the SAT, if you

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,900
can't do it in 10 seconds
you might be doing

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,560
it the wrong way.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,690
It's normally a very,
very quick problem.

31
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,610
And that's why this probably
was not the correct

32
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,250
way of doing it.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,080
You could have just said well
if x is 39, x minus 2 is 37.

34
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,180
Next problem.

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,910
Problem 2.

36
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,440
Students in advanced biology
class-- so they have boys,

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,990
girls, total.

38
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:56,050
   

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,570
And then on this side,
this juniors,

40
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,100
seniors, and then total.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:16,730
And then they write-- this is
k, n, m, r, s, t, w, x, z.

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,070
In the table above, each letter
represents the number

43
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,210
of students in that category.

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,360
k would be the number of junior
boys in the advanced

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,830
biology class.

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,610
Which of the following
must be equal to z?

47
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,970
So z is the total number
of kids, right?

48
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,710
So there's a couple of things
that could be equal to z.

49
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,160
It could be w plus x.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,810
That's not a choice.

51
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,280
It could also be m plus t.

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,130
But that's not a choice
either, right, m

53
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,890
plus t isn't a choice.

54
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,990
And the other way is you could
just add up all of the kids

55
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,120
that are in each of
the categories.

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,450
So z is the total
of all the kids.

57
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,930
So if you say the number of
junior boys plus senior boys

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,320
plus junior girls plus senior
girls, so that's k plus

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,740
n plus r plus s.

60
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,750
That's all the students
in the class, right?

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,390
And that must equal z.

62
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,610
And that is choice E.

63
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,860
Next problem.

64
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,710
   

65
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,450
They have a line
here like that.

66
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,800
   

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,170
And then what do they tell us?

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,350
They tell us that this right
here is 25 degrees.

69
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:46,880
This is a, b, c, this is 60
degrees, and this is x.

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,990
In the triangle ABC above,
what is the value of x.

71
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,510
This is just the angle game.

72
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,280
So the first thing we want to
figure out is this angle.

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,600
And we know that this angle plus
60 is going to be 180,

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,750
right, because it's
supplementary.

75
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,980
They kind of combined to form
180 degrees, or they kind of

76
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,220
created a line to go halfway
around the circle.

77
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,790
So this has to be 120.

78
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,100
Because this plus 60 is 180.

79
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,340
And then we see that 25 plus
120 plus x have to be 180

80
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,280
because they're all in
the same triangle.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,230
So 25 plus 120 plus x is going
to be equal to 180 as well.

82
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,250
So 145 plus x is equal to 180.

83
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,130
Subtract 145 from both sides.

84
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,620
You get x is equal to 35.

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,080
80 minus 45.

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,690
Right.

87
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,660
35 and that's choice C.

88
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,910
Next problem.

89
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,890
   

90
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,040
Problem 4.

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,920
The Martin's refrigerator
is broken and will

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,570
cost $300 to fix.

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,827
And new energy efficient
refrigerator costing $900, so

94
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:54,640
let's say this other
refrigerator costs $900.

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,850
It'll save 15 dollars a month
on the electric bill.

96
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,540
   

97
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,410
If they buy the new refrigerator
in x months, the

98
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,460
Martin's will have saved an
amount equal to the difference

99
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,900
between the cost of the new
refrigerator and the cost of

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,800
the old one.

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,990
What is the value of x?

102
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,180
So they're saying that in x
months this new refrigerator--

103
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,760
they're saying if in x months
the Martin's would have saved

104
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,580
an amount equal to the
difference between the cost of

105
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,950
the new refrigerator and the
cost of fixing the old one.

106
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,910
So what's the cost of the
new refrigerator?

107
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,970
It's $900.

108
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,370
And what's the cost of
fixing the old one?

109
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,970
It's $300.

110
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,170
So that's the difference between
the cost of fixing the

111
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,110
new refrigerator and the cost
of fixing the old one.

112
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,220
And they say that that's
how much they will

113
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,970
have saved in x months.

114
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,700
So they're going to save
that in x months.

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,910
They save $15 a month, right?

116
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,250
So $15 times x months has to be
equal to the difference in

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,850
price, essentially, of
fixing or buying.

118
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,120
And this is a times,
not a minus.

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,330
So you get $600 is
equal to 15x.

120
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,240
So x is equal to 600 over 15.

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,450
So x is equal to 40-- 15 goes in
60 four times, it goes into

122
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,920
600 40 times.

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,090
So that's choice D.

124
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,140
It takes 40 months for
them to break even.

125
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,900
Next problem.

126
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,040
Problem 5.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,690
The perimeter of an equilateral
triangle ABC is 3

128
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,860
times the perimeter of an
equilateral triangle DEF.

129
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:39,040
Let me draw them real fast. This
is one of them, and the

130
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,290
other one actually is smaller.

131
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,860
   

132
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:54,350
If I called this one ABC,
this one is DEF.

133
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,690
They say the perimeter of this
one is 3 times this one-- and

134
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,170
they're both equilateral, right,
so this is x, x, x.

135
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,930
And so we don't know what
these sides are.

136
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,660
But the perimeter of this
one will be 3x-- oh,

137
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,680
then they tell us.

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,880
If the perimeter of DEF is
10, what is the length

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,810
of one side of ABC?

140
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,640
So perimeter of triangle
DEF is equal to 10.

141
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,320
And they tell us that
the perimeter of

142
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,650
ABC is 3 times this.

143
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,150
So that means that the perimeter
of triangle ABC is

144
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,550
going to be 3 times this,
so it's 30, right?

145
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,080
So the perimeter of this
triangle is 30 and it's three

146
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,860
equal sides, so each
side has to be 10.

147
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,620
30 divided by 3.

148
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,290
And that's choice B.

149
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,540
Next problem.

150
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,720
   

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,995
Problem 6.

152
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:56,210
A machine mints coins at the
rate of one coin per second.

153
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,970
If it does this for 10 hours
each day, approximately how

154
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:09,600
many days will it take the
machine to mint 360,000 coins?

155
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,860
How many days?

156
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,880
So let's say how much does
it produce in one day?

157
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,560
So let's see, in one day is
equal to-- so it'll be

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,640
producing for 10 hours
per day times how

159
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,620
many seconds per hour?

160
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,610
Times 3,600 seconds per hour.

161
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,850
And how did I get 3,600?

162
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,340
60 minutes per hour times 60
seconds per minute, right,

163
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,140
that gives you 3,600 times
one coin per second.

164
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,360
And the units actually
cancel out.

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
The hours cancel out with
hours, and then you get

166
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
seconds cancel out with seconds,
and you're left with

167
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,860
coins per day.

168
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,330
So that equals 10 times 3,600
is 36, 1, 2, add another 0,

169
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,490
3,600 coins per day.

170
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,690
So the amount of coins I produce
in d days is going to

171
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,680
be 3,600 times d, times
the number of days.

172
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,470
And that we're saying has
to be equal to 360,000.

173
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,600
Well immediately let's divide
both sides-- d will be 360,000

174
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,150
divided by 3,600.

175
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,150
So that's cancels
out with that.

176
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,420
You have 360 divided by 36, well
that's just equal to 10.

177
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,600
So it will take 10 days to
produce 360,000 coins, and

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,930
that's choice A.

179
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,780
I'll see you in the
next video.
