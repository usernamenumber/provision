1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,850
We now know what a
probability distribution is.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:05,960
It could be a discrete
probability distribution or a

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,080
continuous one, and we learned
that that's a probability

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,200
density function.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,890
Now let's study a couple
of the more common ones.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,810
So let's say I have a coin,
and it's a fair coin, and I'm

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,190
going to flip it five times.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,800
And I'm going to define
my random variable,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,272
X, I'll define it.

10
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:29,390
I'll make it a capital X.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:39,540
It equals the number of
heads I get after 5 flips.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,640
Maybe I flip them all at once.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,395
Maybe I have 5 coins and I
flip them all at once and

14
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:43,270
I just count the heads.

15
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,820
Or I could have one coin and I
could flip it five times and

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,520
see the number of heads.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,740
It actually doesn't matter.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,900
But let's say I have 1 coin and
I flip it five times, just

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,120
so we have no ambiguity.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,310
So this is my definition
of my random variable.

21
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,186
As we know, a random variable,
it's a little different than a

22
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:58,740
regular variable, it's
more of a function.

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,740
It assigns a number with
an experiment and this

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,480
one's pretty easy.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,580
We just count the number of
heads we got after 5 flips and

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,690
that's our random variable, X.

27
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,930
Let's think a little bit of
what are the different

28
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,050
probabilities of getting
different numbers here?

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:21,820
So what is the probability
that X, big capital

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,670
X, is equal to 0?

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,880
So what's the probability that
you get no heads after 5 flips?

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,020
Well, that's essentially the
same thing as the probability

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,690
of getting all tails.

34
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,750
This is a bit of a
review of probability.

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,630
You have to get all tails.

36
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,460
And what's the probably
of each of these tails?

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,275
Well, it's 1/2.

38
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,710
So it'd have to be 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2

39
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,180
times 1/2 times 1/2.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,520
So it'd have to be 1/2
to the fifth power.

41
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,750
1 to the fifth is 1 over
2 to the fifth is 32.

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,920
Fair enough.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Now what's the probability--
I'm going through a little

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,730
bit of a probability review.

45
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,810
Just because I think it's
important just to get the

46
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,240
intuition of where we're going
now and how you actually form a

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,810
discrete probably distribution.

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,430
Now what's the probability
that you get exactly 1 head?

49
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,170
Well, that could just
be the first head.

50
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,290
It could be heads, then tails,
tails, tails, tails, tails.

51
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,790
Or it could be the second head.

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,510
It could be the probability of
tails, heads, tail, tails,

53
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,810
tails and so forth.

54
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,350
This one head that you get, it
could be in any of the 5 spots.

55
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,710
So what's the probability of
each of these situations?

56
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,570
Well the probability that
you get a head is 1/2.

57
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,220
Then the probability you
get tails is 1/2 times

58
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,870
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

59
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,250
So the probability of each of
these situations is 1/32.

60
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,730
Just like the probability of
this particular situation.

61
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,460
In fact, the probability of any
particular order of heads and

62
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,760
tails is going to
be 1 out of 32.

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,420
There's actually 32
possible scenarios.

64
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,590
So the probability of
this is 1 out of 32.

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,100
The probability of
this is 1 out of 32.

66
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
And there's situations like
this because the heads could

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,420
be in any of the 5 spots.

68
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,230
So the probability that we have
exactly one head is equal to 5

69
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,300
times 1/32, which
is equal to 5/32.

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,880
Fair enough.

71
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,330
Now it gets interesting.

72
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,590
What is the probability--
I'll do each of these

73
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,620
in a different color.

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,400
What is the probability that my
random variable is equal to 2?

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,970
So I flip the coin five times,
what is the probability

76
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,960
that I get exactly 2 heads?

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,910
Now it becomes a little
bit interesting.

78
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,700
So what are all the situations?

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,370
I could have heads, heads,
tails, tails, tails.

80
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,350
I could have a head, tails,
heads, tails, tails.

81
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,060
And if you think about it
there's these two heads and

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,720
they can go in a bunch of
different places, and it starts

83
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,750
to get a little bit confusing.

84
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,950
You can't just think of it
in kind of the scenario

85
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,920
analysis like we did here.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,640
You can, but it becomes
a little bit confusing.

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,700
You have to realize one thing.

88
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,120
Each of the scenarios, there's
a 1 out of 32 probability.

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,880
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2
times 1/2 times 1/2.

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,240
So that's a 1 out of 32
probability-- each of those.

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,310
And we have to think about, how
many of these scenarios satisfy

92
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,420
our condition-- 2 heads?

93
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,810
So essentially you could
imagine we have 5 flips

94
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,340
and we're going to choose
2 of them to be heads.

95
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,850
So you could almost imagine if
you had all the flips sitting

96
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,440
around, and we had two chairs,
and we said, OK, whichever

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,240
flips sit in these chairs, they
get to be the heads chair.

98
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,770
Or they get to be
the heads flips.

99
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,450
And we don't care of
what order they sit in.

100
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm going some place with this,
just so you get hopefully,

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,710
a little intuition.

102
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,700
And you might want to watch
some of the probability videos

103
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,320
on this when I talk about the
binomial theorem and all that.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,680
Because I go into this in
a little bit more detail.

105
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,990
But if you think about it that
way, the binomial coefficient

106
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,690
kind of starts to make sense.

107
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,290
Because if you think about,
OK, I have 5 heads-- I

108
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,590
have five flips, sorry.

109
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,010
Which flip is going to
be the first heads?

110
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,920
Well, there's 5 possibilities.

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,970
Let me do this in a
different color.

112
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,020
There's 5 possibilities for
which of the positions or

113
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,650
which of the flips is going
to be the first head.

114
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,100
Now how many possibilities are
there for the second head?

115
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,240
Well, the first flip that
we used, used up one

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,590
of the heads chairs.

117
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,920
Or sorry, the first heads
chair, the first heads spot was

118
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,650
used up by one of the flips.

119
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,140
Now there's only 4 flips left,
so there's only 1 out of 4

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,700
flips that the second
head could be in.

121
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,760
And you saw that here.

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,590
I picked the first one to be a
heads here and then we said,

123
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,850
OK, 1 of these 4 also
have to be a head.

124
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,670
Or if I said, OK, this is the
first head, then either this

125
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,650
one, this one, this one, or
this one has to be heads.

126
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,850
So there's only 4
possibilities.

127
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:04,050
So all I'm saying is the first
time around you have 5

128
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,840
different possibilities for
where the first heads could be.

129
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,540
And then the second
time around you have 4

130
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,280
different possibilities.

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
You have to think about it.

132
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,360
When we count it just like this
we're being dependent on order.

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,650
But we don't care which
flip is in which heads.

134
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,610
We're not saying that this is a
heads 1 or this is a heads 2.

135
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,740
These are both heads.

136
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,380
It doesn't matter.

137
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,150
We could have this being
the head seat 1, this

138
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,370
could be head seat 2.

139
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,600
Or, it could be the
other way around.

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,450
This could be the second head
spot, and this could be

141
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,330
the first head spot.

142
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,100
And I'm saying that just
because it's important to

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,450
realize the distribution of
permutation and a combination.

144
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,170
We don't care about order.

145
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,930
So there's actually two
different ways that

146
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,850
this can happen.

147
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,730
So we divide it by 2.

148
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,490
And as you'll see it's
actually 2 factorial

149
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,830
ways that it can happen.

150
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,110
If this had 3 we would do 3
factorial, and I'll show

151
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,910
you how that can happen.

152
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:01,470
And so this will be equal to--
5 times 4 is 20, divided by

153
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,160
2, which is equal to 10.

154
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,090
So there's 10 different
combinations out of the 32

155
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,240
where you have exactly 2 heads.

156
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,330
So 10 times 1 out of 32
equal to 10/32, which

157
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:13,820
is equal to what?

158
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,040
5/16.

159
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,390
And actually, let me
write this in terms of

160
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,410
a binomial coefficient.

161
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,620
This up here, that number right
there, if you think about it--

162
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,640
that's the same thing as
5 factorial over,

163
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,410
what's 5 times 4?

164
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,310
5 factorial is 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

165
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,690
So if I just want 5 times 4
what I can do is I divide 5

166
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,550
factorial divided
by 3 factorial.

167
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,890
This is equal to 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1

168
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,700
divided by 3 times 2 times 1.

169
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,870
And you're just left
with the 5 times 4.

170
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,150
So this is the same
thing as that.

171
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,220
And then, since we didn't
care about order, we

172
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,400
wanted the 2 here.

173
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,290
And actually, it turns out
that it's 2 factorial.

174
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,430
I'll show you that
in a little bit.

175
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,920
It's two factorial times 1/32.

176
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,510
This was the probability that
our random variable-- that

177
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,200
we have exactly 2 heads.

178
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,870
Now what's the probability
that we have exactly 3 heads?

179
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,970
The probability that
x is equal to 3.

180
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,080
So by the same logic, the
first head spot can be

181
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,170
taken by 1 of the 5 flips.

182
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,580
Then the second head spot
can be taken by 1 of the

183
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,490
4 left remaining flips.

184
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,170
And then the third head spot
could be taken by 1 of

185
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,670
the 3 remaining flips.

186
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,030
And then, how many different
ways can I arrange 3 flips?

187
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,410
In general, how many ways
can you arrange 3 things?

188
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,060
And it's 3 factorial.

189
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,740
And you could work that out or
you might want to watch the

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,070
probability videos where I work
that a little bit better.

191
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,400
But actually, If if you just
take the letters A, B, and C

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,380
there's 6 ways that you
can arrange these.

193
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,040
You can view these
as the head spots.

194
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,530
And we don't care about order,
so it could be ACB, CAB.

195
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:10,290
It could be BAC, BCA, and
then what's the last one

196
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,110
that I haven't done?

197
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,310
It's CBA.

198
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,980
There are 6 ways to arrange
3 distinct things.

199
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,710
We're dividing by it because we
don't want to double count

200
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,010
these 6 different ways because
we're viewing them all

201
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,870
as the same thing.

202
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,900
Not in this case, but in the
case of we don't care which

203
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,740
flip is sitting in
which head spot.

204
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,860
So that's why I got
the 3 factorial.

205
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,280
And this is the same thing.

206
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,670
5 times 4 times 3-- this could
be written as 5 factorial

207
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,150
divided by 3 factorial.

208
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,370
Then this is divided
by 3 factorial.

209
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,070
This one is this one.

210
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,340
And so this is equal to-- I
don't know-- 3 factorial is

211
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,460
equal to 3 times 2 times 1.

212
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,910
The 3's cancel out.

213
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,570
This becomes a 2.

214
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,790
This becomes a 1.

215
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,910
Once again, 5 times
2, so it's 10.

216
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,570
Each situation has a 1 in
32 probability, so once

217
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,310
again it's equal to 5/16.

218
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,030
And that's interesting.

219
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,890
The probability that you get
3 heads is the same as the

220
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,500
probability you get 2 heads.

221
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,440
And the reason that-- well,
there's a lot of reasons

222
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,060
why that's the case.

223
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,200
But if you think about the
probability of getting 3 heads

224
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,580
is the same thing as the
probability of getting 2 tails.

225
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,370
And the probability of getting
2 tails should be the same

226
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,390
thing as the probability
of getting 2 heads.

227
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,650
And so it's nice that the
numbers work out that way.

228
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,610
All right, so we're
almost there.

229
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,660
What's the probability
that x is equal to 4?

230
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,170
Well, we could use the same
kind of formula now that

231
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,650
we were using before.

232
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,370
You know, it could be 5
times 4 times 3 times 2.

233
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,450
So that's 5 times 4 times 3
times 2-- all the way, how many

234
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,260
ways can you arrange 4 things?

235
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,370
It's 4 factorial.

236
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,750
4 factorial is essentially
this thing right here.

237
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,490
4 times 3 times 2 times-- this
is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

238
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,330
So these cancel out, so it's 5
and then each of the scenarios

239
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,650
has a 1 in 32 chance.

240
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,500
So it's equal to 5/32.

241
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,710
And once again, notice, the
probability of getting 4 heads

242
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,290
is the same thing as the
probability of getting

243
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,670
exactly 1 head.

244
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,250
And that makes sense because
4 heads is the same thing

245
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,580
as getting exactly 1 tail.

246
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,985
And you say, oh, where's
that one tail going

247
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:25,630
to be showing up?

248
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,210
Oh, there's 5 different
spot for it.

249
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,790
And each of the scenarios
has a 1 in 32 possibility.

250
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,320
And then finally, what's
the probability that

251
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,180
x is equal to 5?

252
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,545
You get all 5 heads.

253
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,040
You know, it's going
to be heads, heads,

254
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,850
heads, heads, heads.

255
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,440
Each of these have
a 1/2 probability.

256
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,820
You multiply them,
you get 1 out of 32.

257
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,880
Or another way to think about
it, if you think about it, the

258
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,660
32 different ways that you can
have heads and tails in these

259
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,920
experiments-- this is only
one of those circumstances.

260
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,180
This was 5 of the
circumstances.

261
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,410
This was 10 of the
circumstances.

262
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,960
Anyway, we've done the work,
now we're ready to draw a

263
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,540
probability distribution.

264
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,650
I'm running out of time.

265
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,320
Actually, let me continue
that in the next video.

266
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,270
And if you're in the mood,
maybe you draw it before

267
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,490
you watch the next video.

268
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,010
See you soon.
