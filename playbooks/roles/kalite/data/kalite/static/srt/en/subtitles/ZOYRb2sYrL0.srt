1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,800
You will hear me use the word abstract a lot

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,621
so i thought i would actually give you an attempt at a definition,

3
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:09,267
or maybe even more important

4
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,800
an intuition of what abstract means

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,067
and abstract can be an adjective

6
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,267
you can have an abstract idea

7
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,267
you can have abstract art

8
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,600
or it can be a verb

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,200
you can abstract something

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,067
abstract the idea from some other idea

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,836
and you can even have it as a noun

12
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:28,467
you can have an abstract

13
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,252
and it tends to, if you use it as a noun

14
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:31,572
the one I tend to associate

15
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,200
is the abstract of research paper, which is kind of,

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,133
distills the essence of the research paper,

17
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:38,733
which is kind of a summary of that paper

18
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,200
and the one thing you are going to see

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
regardless of how you

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,467
what context you use the word abstract

21
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,800
there's this kind of notion taking the essence

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,200
of a real world object

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,231
whether you use it as a noun, adjective, or a verb

24
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,067
so over here we have our real world

25
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,379
we have our real world

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,410
and then over here you have your world of

27
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,267
you have ideas and concepts

28
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,400
and the general idea behind the abstraction

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,733
or abstracting something

30
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:10,933
is that you're taking it away

31
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:13,467
from the particular concrete real world

32
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:17,867
and you're going more into the direction of ideas and concepts

33
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:22,267
and probably for me, one of the most tangible ways of

34
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:25,733
thinking about abstraction, which is kind of a contradiction in itself

35
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,400
to think of abstraction in a tangible way

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,713
is things like geometric shapes

37
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:34,969
so if i were to tell you to find me some cubes

38
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,267
you might point to a borg vessel right over there

39
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,302
a borg vessel

40
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:44,800
you might point to a pair of dice

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,867
let me draw a pair of dice

42
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:48,952
if you were looking for cubes

43
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:51,733
so you might point to a pair of dice

44
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,933
that looks something like that

45
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,733
you might point to a Rubik's cube

46
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:56,800
anything you might find

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,733
there might be a building that looks like a cube

48
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,733
it might be a building that looks like a cube

49
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,467
or maybe there is a box in your house that is a cube

50
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:07,667
but in your mind you have a general idea of what a cube is

51
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,733
like i know a cube when i see one

52
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:13,133
and a general idea is distilling the concept

53
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,600
the idea of what a cube is

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
and all of these ideas are very different

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,267
this is some plastic thing i could hold in my hand

56
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,733
these are these white things

57
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,200
they aren't even geometrically close to being perfect

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
they have these little divets on the side right over there

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
this is a large borg vessel that you know

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,067
that doesn't exist yet

61
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,733
is a fictional thing

62
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,400
that they all have this cubeness to them

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
one of the fun things about geometry

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,733
so really distill the essence of these real world shapes

65
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,800
and we do have this definition in geometry

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,918
which is an object like this

67
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:52,700
where every side has the exact same length

68
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,108
so this is length one and that would be length one

69
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,815
that would be length one

70
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:58,098
it doesn't have to be

71
00:02:58,113 --> 00:02:59,621
whatever the length of this side is

72
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,800
and this dimension

73
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
then this dimension would be that length

74
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,133
and then that dimension is going to be that length

75
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,933
and i'm not giving you the rigorous definition

76
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,267
but i'm just trying to highlight that there is

77
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:12,200
pure idea of what a cube is

78
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,267
of what a cube is

79
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,733
and the real world, there is nothing that is actually

80
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,533
a perfect cube

81
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,333
if you were to get really really close to the die

82
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,533
if you were to measure exactly their measurements

83
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,667
they won't be exactly the same measurement

84
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:32,267
but the abstract idea is completely the same length as this

85
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:35,200
and this and this and all of the edges are going to

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,467
have the exact same length

87
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,015
so this is going from the concrete

88
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,933
the specific from the real world

89
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,933
if you consider the 24th or the 25th century, the real world

90
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:49,205
to going to the idea behind it, the general idea

91
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:51,748
and you probably also heard the word abstract

92
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,267
in terms of art, like abstract art

93
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,467
so this is abstract art

94
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,933
and it is the same general idea

95
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,000
so if you to look it up in the dictionary

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you're going to find 20 definitions of the word abstract

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,200
but it's all, essentially trying to say the same thing

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,467
abstract art is art that is not focused on trying to paint

99
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,667
reality the exact way reality exists

100
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:15,000
if you look at kind of lot of Renaissance art

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,998
they are skilled at painting figures

102
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:18,933
exactly how they look in the real world

103
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,333
but the abstract artist

104
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,060
sometimes they're not even trying

105
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,267
to represent anything from the real world

106
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,800
they are trying to represent a raw idea or

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,000
a raw expression of color and form and texture

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
and this is a Jackson Pollock painting

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,533
right over here and i printed out so many things wrong

110
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:39,267
taken by our own Steven Zucker, our art historian

111
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,800
and you can see that it's not clear

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
Jackson Pollock is not trying to paint a

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,856
you know, a dog or horse or anything like that

114
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:49,333
he is painting something that is devoid

115
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,379
completely independent of anything

116
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:55,733
that we actually see in physical reality

117
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,133
and the word, abstraction, you know,

118
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,800
it doesn't just apply on just a pure geometry and art

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,800
it applies to almost everything we do on a daily basis

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,467
when we even talk about things

121
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,815
when we even use words or use symbols

122
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,867
we are essentially abstracting away

123
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:16,471
we're abstracting the essence of something that actually exists in physical reality

124
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,867
so if i use the word dog

125
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,671
it is a set of symbols that represent something in our mind

126
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,533
that we associate with dog

127
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,467
we have in our minds kind of the quality

128
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,533
of what a dog actually is

129
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:31,667
you know, it has four legs

130
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,554
and floppy ears and you enjoy petting it

131
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:37,458
and they're man's or i guess people's best friend

132
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,708
you imagine this thing called a dog

133
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,975
and it has the essence of dog

134
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,748
and when you actually look at dogs in the real world

135
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,538
they look very very different type of animals

136
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,152
like when you look at a great dane

137
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:52,385
or kind of a super small poodle

138
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,429
But we recognize there is an essence of those particulars

139
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:58,231
that we can abstract away and say this is a dog

140
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:00,871
and we abstract it even more by representing these letter symbols

141
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:02,948
that tend to conjure up this image

142
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:05,000
even when we write something as simple as a number

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,354
so if i write the number five

144
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,533
we use it so frequently that to us

145
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,292
a number 5 seems kind of like a concrete thing

146
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,687
but it 's so abstract

147
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,487
it's just a quantity of things

148
00:06:17,487 --> 00:06:19,000
i can symbolize like that

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,968
i could have symbolized 5 like that

150
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:24,887
i could have symbolized 5 in roman numerals like that

151
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:26,800
i could symbolize it like that

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,667
and in all of these cases they are

153
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,333
it is the idea of a quantity of five things

154
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:35,933
five, you know, you could say point me to a five

155
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,400
and someone could draw or point you to something like that

156
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,477
but they are still pointing you to the symbol of five

157
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:45,188
but it's still an very abstract idea

158
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,267
so hopefully this gives you an appreciation

159
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:48,831
for what abstract means

160
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,200
as you can tell, you know

161
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,000
it's kind of a, for lack of a better word

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,400
it's kind of an abstract idea

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,108
not to be too cute about that
