1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,740
Let's say we've got a company here that has

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:08,243
exactly four shares, just to simplify things.

3
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:11,076
Obviously very few companies have only four shares,

4
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:13,816
but this will simplify the explanation.

5
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,400
And let's say that each of those shares right now

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,267
is trading in the market, or I guess we could say,

7
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:22,407
in the last transaction that's occurred in trading these shares,

8
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:26,098
they're trading at two dollars per share.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,904
So the market is saying that

10
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,901
each of those shares is worth two dollars,

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,067
there's four of those shares in total,

12
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,000
and we're going to assume that this company has no liabilities,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,667
so the shareholders just outright own the assets,

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,977
so if there's four of these shares times two dollars,

15
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:46,867
the market is saying that

16
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:51,533
this company's assets are worth exactly eight dollars.

17
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:55,867
Eight dollars, right over here.

18
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:58,533
The asset value, the market value of the assets is

19
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,400
the same as the market cap in this case

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,133
because we have no liabilities.

21
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,000
Now what I want to think about is,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,222
what happens if the company wants to raise some more money?

23
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:11,667
Let's say that they want to issue some more shares and sell them

24
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,072
to raise some money to buy a factory or whatever.

25
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,233
So what they literally do is,

26
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:17,933
the board approves for them to literally create

27
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:25,000
two more shares, so now they have a total of six shares outstanding,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,562
and then the company goes, they get an investment banker

29
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,933
and they do a secondary offering in the public markets

30
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,555
and they sell these incremental shares.

31
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:35,667
And they're able to sell them, let's just say for simplicity,

32
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,963
at two dollars per share.

33
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,733
Normally when you increase the supply a little bit

34
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,733
you won't get quite what the previous market value was,

35
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:48,600
but you get roughly two dollars a share, for simplicity.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,549
And by selling two shares that they just created

37
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:52,867
for two dollars a share,

38
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:57,800
the company is able to raise another four dollars.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,400
So the whole reason why I'm going through this exercise

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,733
is to ask a question.

41
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:06,733
Did dilution take place?

42
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,221
And there are different ways to think about it.

43
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,733
When you think about dilution, it's like you could imagine.

44
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,600
If you have a sweet syrup and you add water to it,

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
it becomes less sweet.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,623
Each cube of that water, each drop of that water

47
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:21,133
has less sugar in it. You've diluted it.

48
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,933
And so there seems to be an analogy here.

49
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:27,067
We now have more shares for the same company.

50
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,213
And it is true.

51
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:31,067
If you were the owner of this share over here,

52
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:35,133
before the share offering up here,

53
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,896
you owned 25% of the company.

54
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:41,933
After the share offering, you owned one sixteenth.

55
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,733
So — not one sixteenth, one sixth.

56
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:49,467
So after, you own one sixth, or approximately 16%.

57
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:53,291
So it looks like the percentage that you own of the company has been diluted

58
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,055
and that's true to some degree.

59
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,726
But sometimes the dilution takes on another meaning

60
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:01,133
that somehow, because more shares are being used

61
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,133
for the ownership of the same company,

62
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,551
maybe these shares are worth less.

63
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:06,800
And that's the one thing that I want to challenge.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
There is dilution in the percentage that you own,

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,467
but there is not dilution in what the shares are worth.

66
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:15,721
Because before, if you had four shares representing

67
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,800
something that is worth eight dollars,

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,295
now you have six shares representing

69
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,400
something that is twelve dollars.

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,220
Because the company didn't just issue these shares

71
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,733
and get nothing in return for it.

72
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:27,633
It got four dollars of cash.

73
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,400
You can't debate the value of four dollars.

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,733
Four dollars are worth four dollars.

75
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:35,333
So now the assets of the company are worth twelve dollars.

76
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:38,133
So you have twelve dollars of assets, no liabilities,

77
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:41,400
six shares, twelve dollars divided by six shares

78
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,956
is still two dollars per share.

79
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,400
So the value per share has not been diluted,

80
00:03:46,400 --> 99:59:59,999
just the percentage of the company that you happen to own.
