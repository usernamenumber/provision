1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's do some more
limit examples.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,250
So let's get another problem.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:19,860
If I had the limit as x
approaches 3 of, let's say,

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:31,190
x squared minus 6x plus 9
over x squared minus 9.

6
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,450
So the first thing I like to do
whenever I see any of these

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,150
limits problems is just
substitute the number in and

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,413
see if I get something
that makes sense, and

9
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,670
then we'd be done.

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,170
Well, usually we'd be done.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,490
I don't want to make these
sweeping statements.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,880
If the function is
continuous, we'd be done.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,250
But if we put the 3 in the
numerator, we get 3 squared,

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,040
which is 9, minus 18 plus 9.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,660
So that equals 0.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,510
And the denominator also--
let's see, 3 squared minus

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,400
9, that also equals 0.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,970
So we don't like having 0/0.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,840
My pen tool is
malfunctioning again.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,290
So we don't like getting 0, 0,
0, so is there any way we can

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,010
simplify this expression to
maybe get it to an expression

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,110
that, when we evaluate it at x
equals 3, we actually get

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,640
something that makes sense?

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,180
Well, whenever I see two of
these polynomials here, and

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,220
they look, just by inspecting
them, relatively easy to

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,220
factor, I like to factor them
out because maybe there's the

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,250
same factor in the numerator
and the denominator, and

28
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,610
then we can simplify it.

29
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,110
So let's say that this is the
same thing as-- that looks

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:39,690
like it's x plus 3--
no, no, no, x minus 3.

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,450
This is x minus 3.

32
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,280
It actually looks like it's x
minus 3 squared, but we're

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,840
just going to write x minus 3
times x minus 3, which is, of

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,820
course, x minus 3 squared.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,940
And then in the denominator,
you know how to factor these,

36
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:01,310
this is x plus 3 times
x minus 3, all right?

37
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,990
So the limit as x approaches 3
of this expression is the same

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,960
thing as the limit as
x approaches 3 of

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,760
this expression.

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,660
And, of course, there's nothing
we can do to change the fact

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,150
that this function, or this
expression, is undefined

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,360
at x equals 3.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,500
But if we can simplify
it, we can figure out

44
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,320
what it approaches.

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,010
Well, if we assume that x is
any number but 3, we can cross

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,330
out these two terms because
then they wouldn't be 0, right?

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,020
It only is 0 when x is equal to
3 because-- so in the numerator

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,990
and the denominator, we
can cross this out.

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,250
And we can say-- and I'm not
being very rigorous here, but

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,610
this is kind of how it's
taught, and I think you get the

51
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,180
intuition-- that this is the
same thing as the limit as x

52
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,200
approaches 3 of x minus
3 over x plus 3.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,330
Now let's just try to stick
the x in and see what we get.

54
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,010
Well, in the numerator,
we get 3 minus 3.

55
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,030
We still get 0.

56
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,190
But in the denominator
here, we get 6, right?

57
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,520
3 plus 3 is 6.

58
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,770
So now we get a good number.

59
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,680
0 or 6, well, that's a
real number, so it's 0.

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,710
0/6 is 0.

61
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,170
So that was interesting.

62
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,660
The first time we did it,
we got the answer 0/0.

63
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,760
And now we get the answer
0 by simplifying.

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,590
But, of course, it's very
important to remember that

65
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,810
this expression is not
defined at x equals 3.

66
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,280
It's defined everywhere but,
but if we were to graph it, and

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,070
I encourage you to do so, you
would see that as you get

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,980
closer and closer to x
equals 3, the value of this

69
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,960
expression will equal 0.

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,060
And I know what
you're thinking.

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,350
Well, this was 0/0.

72
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,190
Is every time I get 0/0 going
to end up just becoming 0 when

73
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,300
I evaluate the expression?

74
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,240
Well, let's explore that.

75
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,570
Let me clear this.

76
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:56,080
Let's say what is-- pen is not
working-- the limit as x

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:17,860
approaches 1 of x squared
minus x minus 2.

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,650
   

79
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,640
No, let's say x squared
plus x minus 2.

80
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,110
As you can see, I do all
this in my head, and

81
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,450
I'm prone to mistakes.

82
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,370
And all of that over x minus 1.

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,940
Well, once again, if we just
evaluate it, let's see what

84
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,930
happens when x equals 1.

85
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,200
You get 1 squared plus
1, so it's 2 minus 2.

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,010
You get 0/0.

87
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,640
So once again, we get 0/0, and
we have to do something to

88
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,960
this maybe to simplify it.

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,620
Well, let's factor the top.

90
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,530
So that's the same thing as
the limit as x approaches 1.

91
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,450
Well, that's x minus 1
times x plus 2, right?

92
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,020
   

93
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,840
And I think you'll often
discover when you see a lot of

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,720
limit problems that even if
this top factor, if this top

95
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,710
expression, is hard to factor,
chances are, one of the things

96
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,390
in the denominator that are
making this expression

97
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,770
undefined is probably
a factor up here.

98
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,390
So sometimes you might get a
more complex thing that isn't

99
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,510
as easy to factor as this, but
a good starting point is to

100
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,840
guess that one of the factors
is going to be in the bottom

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,360
expression because that's kind
of the trick of these problems,

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,750
to just simplify
the expression.

103
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,390
So once again, if we assume
that x does not equal 1, and

104
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,440
this expression would not be
0 and this would not be 0,

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,230
then these two could
be canceled out.

106
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,010
And we get that this is just
the same thing as the limit as

107
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,070
x approaches 1 of x plus 2.

108
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,030
Well, now this is pretty easy.

109
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,850
What's the limit as x
approaches 1 of x plus 2?

110
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,180
Well, you just stick 1 in
there, and you get 3.

111
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,010
So it's interesting.

112
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,840
When we just tried to
evaluate the expression at

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,580
x equals 1, we got 0/0.

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,840
And in the previous example, we
saw that it evaluated out when

115
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,870
you simplified it to 0, and in
this example, it came out to 3.

116
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,760
And I really encourage you, if
you have a graphing calculator,

117
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,110
graph these functions that
we're doing and see and show

118
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,080
yourself visually that it's
true, that the limit as you

119
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,190
approach, say, x equals 1
actually does approach the

120
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,950
limits that were solving for.

121
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,600
And make up your own problems.

122
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,940
Hell, that's what I'm doing.

123
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,650
So you could prove
it to yourself.

124
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,320
So let's do another.

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,280
Let's do one that I think
is pretty interesting.

126
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,020
   

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:57,770
Let's say what's the limit
as x approaches infinity?

128
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:04,300
The limit as x approaches
infinity of, let's say, x

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:17,650
squared plus 3 over
x to the third.

130
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,960
So the way I think about these
problems as they approach

131
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,910
infinity, just think about what
happens when you get

132
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,960
really, really, really
large values of x.

133
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,030
And kind of a cheating way of
doing this is, if you have a

134
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,840
calculator, even if you don't
have a calculator, put

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
in huge numbers here.

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,610
See what happens when x is a
million, see what happens when

137
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,900
x is a billion, see what
happens when x is a trillion,

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,030
and I think you'll
get the point.

139
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,270
You'll see what-- if there
is a limit here, you'll

140
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,500
see what it's going to.

141
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,090
But the way I think about it
is, in the numerator, kind of

142
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,180
the fastest-growing term here
is the x squared term, right?

143
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,970
This is the fastest-growing
term here.

144
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,820
In the denominator, what's
the fastest-growing term?

145
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,475
Well, in the denominator,
the fastest-growing term

146
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,440
is this x to the third.

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, what's going to
grow faster, x to the

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
third or x squared?

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
Well, yeah, x to the third's
going to grow a lot

150
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,130
faster than x squared.

151
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,310
So this denominator, as you get
larger and larger and larger

152
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,230
values of x, is going to grow a
lot faster than that numerator.

153
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,700
So you could imagine if the
denominator's growing much,

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,905
much, much faster than the
numerator, as you get larger

155
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:17,130
and larger numbers, you're
going to get a smaller and

156
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,630
smaller and smaller
fraction, right?

157
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,280
It's going to approach 0.

158
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,590
And so as you go to
infinity, it approaches 0.

159
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,530
I know that I kind of just
hand waved, but that's really

160
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,320
how you think about it.

161
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,830
Another way you could do
it is you could actually

162
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,940
divide this fraction.

163
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,470
You could actually divide this
rational expression, and you'll

164
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,750
get something like 1/x plus
something, something,

165
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,620
something, and then you'd also
see, oh, well, the limit as x

166
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,270
approaches infinity
of 1/x is also 0.

167
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,900
Let's do one more.

168
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll do this fast so
I can confuse you.

169
00:08:49,190 --> 00:09:00,490
The limit as x approaches
infinity of 3x squared plus

170
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,670
x over 4x squared minus 5.

171
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,170
   

172
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,680
These problems kind of look
confusing sometimes, but

173
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,480
they're really easy.

174
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,330
You just have to think about
what happens as you get

175
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,700
really large values of x.

176
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,320
Well, as you get really large
values of x, these small terms,

177
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,670
these ones that don't grow as
fast as these large terms,

178
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,640
kind of don't matter anymore,
right, because you're getting

179
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,270
really large values of x.

180
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,210
And this case, these don't
matter anymore, and then

181
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,210
these two x terms grow
at the same pace, right?

182
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,070
And they'll always be
kind of growing in

183
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,000
this ratio of 3 to 4.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,870
So the limit here is
actually that easy.

185
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,880
It's 3/4.

186
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
So what you do is you just
figure out what's the

187
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,940
fastest-growing term on the
top, what's the fastest-growing

188
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,000
term on the bottom, and then
figure out what it approaches.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,680
If they're the same term, then
they kind of cancel out, and

190
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,700
you say the limit
approaches 3/4.

191
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,410
It's a very nonrigorous way
of doing it, but it gets

192
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,570
you the right answer.

193
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,370
See you in the next
presentation.

194
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,500
