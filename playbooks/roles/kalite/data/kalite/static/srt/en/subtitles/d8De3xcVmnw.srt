1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,770
We're told that the sum
of three consecutive

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,080
odd integers is 231.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,470
What is the largest integer?

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,340
So let's think about
this a little bit.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,920
Let's say that x is the
smallest integer.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,040
x is equal to the smallest
odd of these three.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,110
It's not the smallest odd
integer of all integers, it's

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,270
is the smallest odd of
these three, the

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,600
smallest odd integer.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,290
So what's the next
one going to be?

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,380
Well, if I have one odd integer,
what's going to be

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,650
the next odd integer?

14
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,500
Let's think about this.

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,050
If x was 3, what's the
next odd integer?

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,920
It's 5.

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,160
And then what's the next
one after that?

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,820
It's 7.

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,200
And the next one after that?

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,350
It's 9.

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,320
So every time we add 2.

22
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,460
So if the smallest one is x, the
next smallest odd integer

23
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:54,940
is x plus 2, is equal to the
next smallest odd integer--

24
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,150
I'll write integer here--
odd integer.

25
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,580
And then what would
be the next one?

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,820
Well, we're going to add
2 to this one, right?

27
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,379
So it's going to be x plus 4.

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:04,860
Think about it.

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,260
If the smallest is 3, then you
have x plus 2, which is 5.

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,240
And then you have x plus
4, which is 7.

31
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:18,260
So this will be the largest of
the consecutive odd integer in

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,200
this group.

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,940
And they tell us that the sum
of these consecutive odd

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,910
integers is 231.

35
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,600
What is the largest integer?

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,190
So if I take x, x plus 2 and x
plus 4, and I sum them, they

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,820
should be equal to 231.

38
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,550
So let's do that.

39
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:39,930
So we have x plus x plus 2, plus
x plus 4, and this needs

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,880
to be equal to 231.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,865
And when they ask us what's the
largest one, we're going

42
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:46,930
to have to tell them what
x plus 4 is equal to.

43
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,790
So let's just solve
this equation.

44
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,480
So let's add our x terms. We
have one x, two x, three x's,

45
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,630
so we get 3x plus-- and then
what are our constants?

46
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,890
We have a 2 and we have a 4.

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,750
So 3x plus 6 is equal to 231.

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,250
Now, let's get rid
of the 6 from the

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,440
left-hand side of the equation.

50
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,350
The best way to do that it is to
subtract 6 from both sides.

51
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,910
So let's subtract 6
from both sides.

52
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,990
The left-hand side, we're
just left with the 3x.

53
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,470
The 6's cancel out.

54
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:30,500
The right-hand side,
231 minus 6 is 225.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,895
We have 3x is equal to 225.

56
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:36,030
To isolate the x, let's just
divide both sides by 3.

57
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,050
   

58
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,720
The left-hand side, the 3's
cancel out-- that was the

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,880
whole point behind dividing by
3-- we get just an x is being

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,490
equal to-- and 225
divided by 3.

61
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,320
Let me do it over here.

62
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,630
So 3 goes into 225.

63
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,750
It goes into 22 7 times.

64
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,180
7 times 3 is 21.

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,950
22 minus 21 is 1.

66
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,810
Bring down the 5.

67
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,540
3 goes into 15 5 times.

68
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,700
5 times 3 is 15.

69
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,860
Subtract, no remainder.

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:20,150
So 225 divided by 3 is 75.

71
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,840
So the smallest, the smallest
of the odd integers is 75.

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
So this one is 75.

73
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,430
What's x plus 2 going
to be equal to?

74
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,670
Well, that's going
to be 2 more, 77.

75
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,770
And what's x plus 4 going
to be equal to?

76
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,550
Well, that's the largest
of them.

77
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,130
x is 75 plus 4 is
going to be 79.

78
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,470
And notice, we have three
odd integers.

79
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,450
They're consecutive.

80
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,110
They're the, you know, they're
the odd integers that come

81
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,710
directly after each other.

82
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,680
And let's verify that when we
add them up, we get 231.

83
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,050
So if we get 75 plus-- let me
just write it like this-- 75

84
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,850
plus 77, plus 79, want
to add them all up.

85
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,920
5 plus 7 is 12.

86
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,320
12 plus 9 is 21.

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Carry the 2.

88
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,680
2 plus 7 is 9.

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,209
9 plus 7 is 16.

90
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,019
16 plus 7 is 23.

91
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,990
So there you have it.

92
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,210
The three consecutive odd
integers, when you add them

93
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,830
up, you got 231.

94
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,470
They're consecutive and odd.

95
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,910
They ask, what's the largest?

96
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,040
The largest is 79.

97
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,266
