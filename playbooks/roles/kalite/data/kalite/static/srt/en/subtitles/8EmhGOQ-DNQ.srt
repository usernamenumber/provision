1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,741
So say it's the holiday season

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:03,236
and you're supposed to be all festive and jolly.

3
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,890
But you're more of the Grinchy type and

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,160
all you want to do is wheel-trip objects against things.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,032
So you're doing your holiday part by making paper snowflakes.

6
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:12,144
Regardless of your feelings about the holidays,

7
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:13,770
slicing things into tiny bits is an art,

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,970
and one that you are taking very seriously.

9
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,415
Like, some people make so-called paper snowflakes

10
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:19,922
by folding a piece of paper in half,

11
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,104
and then in half again, and again,

12
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,461
and then cutting it up.

13
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:24,320
But paper snowflake connoisseurs know that

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,344
real snowflakes have six-fold symmetry,

15
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,237
and this thing has 4-fold symmetry;

16
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,860
that would never happen in nature.

17
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,570
So you do it the real way, by folding your paper in half twice,

18
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,754
and then folding it in thirds.

19
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:36,459
Or I suppose you could do it by halves, and then thirds,

20
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:38,257
and then halves again.

21
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:40,055
But you can't do thirds, then halves, then halves again,

22
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:41,838
because what would that even mean?

23
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,555
but you do notice your first halves can be at any angle you want -

24
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,087
you don't need to line it up or anything.

25
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,720
It's kind of funny, because to get six-fold symmetry,

26
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,445
you need to fold it into 12 sections,

27
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:53,722
and if you fold into 6 sections, you only get 3-fold symmetry.

28
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:56,454
Which is actually a way that snowflakes occasionally form,

29
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:57,472
so those are allowed.

30
00:00:57,472 --> 00:01:00,441
And then there are even sometimes 12-fold symmetric snowflakes in nature,

31
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:04,475
which means you can fold again to make that - but never 4-fold.

32
00:01:04,475 --> 00:01:06,251
The problem with folding paper is

33
00:01:06,251 --> 00:01:07,604
that the thickness starts to get in the way.

34
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:10,654
This makes points uneven, which might actually be more natural.

35
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,449
Most real snowflakes are actually pretty lumpy and flawed -

36
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,555
just, those aren't the ones people take and share pictures of.

37
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:19,122
And that's not the kind of snowflake you want to make, either.

38
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:21,462
I mean, when you fold this angle into thirds,

39
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:24,155
this flap is under this one, so it has to be a little shorter -

40
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:25,771
at least, if this edge lines up here.

41
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,602
But maybe if you folded one in front and one in back,

42
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:31,476
accordion style, then all three sections could be the same.

43
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:33,971
In fact, then instead of folding it in half, like this,

44
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,872
you could do each section back and forth, and that's much better.

45
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:39,200
Or, maybe you get bored of 6-fold symmetry,

46
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,873
and decide to make a 5-fold one.

47
00:01:40,873 --> 00:01:42,483
Well, if you need 5 lines of symmetry,

48
00:01:42,483 --> 00:01:45,367
that's 10 sections; so first you fold it in half,

49
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,772
and then you need to fold this into 5ths.

50
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,623
You can use a protractor, or just kind of eyeball it and adjust...

51
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:52,462
There. 5-fold snowflake.

52
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,736
In fact, if you get good at folding this initial 5-fold wedge,

53
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,896
you can do a single straight cut on it to get a star super-quickly.

54
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:00,988
Or you can slice it up and get lots of stars.

55
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,929
Or cut fancy stuff in there for fancy snowflakes.

56
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:05,510
Stars count as holiday spirit, right?

57
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,764
And you can do 7-fold symmetry in a similar way,

58
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:10,185
but you're probably gonna need your emergency protractor.

59
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:11,752
But you can do 9-fold without a protractor,

60
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:13,899
because you can do thirds and then thirds again,

61
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,898
and if you can do 5ths without a protractor,

62
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:19,238
you can do 10ths, too, because it's 1/5 times 1/2.

63
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,745
Like I said, happy holidays; but I never said which ones.

64
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:23,854
Valentines day is totally a winter holiday.

65
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,689
11 is prime, though, so time for the protractor again.

66
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,489
Look, prime factorization!

67
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,465
Okay, so now theoretically you can get all sorts of n-fold symmetry.

68
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,369
But what about rotational symmetry?

69
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,433
There's no mirror lines, which means no folding,

70
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,469
so does it even make sense as a question?

71
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,309
Cutting a snowflake design efficiently is

72
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:41,670
all about putting the same cut lines on top of each other,

73
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,448
so you only have to cut them once.

74
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:46,416
So how do you take a rotationally symmetric design like this,

75
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,342
and put all the layers on top of each other,

76
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,986
without overlapping anything else?

77
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,609
Maybe it's not surprising to see that

78
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:55,066
to get stuff with rotational symmetry to line up, you rotate it.

79
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,773
If you make a cut to the center, then you can rotate all the way,

80
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:00,022
and roll the symmetry up into 1 unique thing.

81
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:02,387
It's hard to draw accurate rotational symmetry by hand,

82
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:05,485
but now I can symmetrize this badly-drawn Cyrell design.

83
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,570
So to cut out a paper snowflake, start with a cut,

84
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,387
then curl your paper into a cone.

85
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,906
You can swirl around once, or twice, or more,

86
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,905
but the important thing is to make sure the cut lines up with itself.

87
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:19,048
Because as far as symmetry is concerned, that cut doesn't exist.

88
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:22,246
I like to tape it in place so it doesn't unroll, then cut stuff out.

89
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,004
I find that spirally things work well.

90
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,885
Folding the paper is a good way to start a cut,

91
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,773
but remember that folding creates symmetry,

92
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:29,528
so I like to use it to just to get the scissors in there

93
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:32,705
and then do something asymmetric. Voila! Swirlflake!

94
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,206
For a starflake-swirlflake,

95
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:36,889
you'll have to curl your paper around 5 times or 4 times?

96
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:39,373
It's funny because I think of this as going around once,

97
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:40,759
but really it's going around twice,

98
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,198
and a flat sheet of paper goes around once.

99
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,722
Anyway, yeah, do that, and then give it a nice spirally arm. Or two.

100
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:50,189
You can make a nice fancy starflake-swirlflake-snowflake; awesome flake.

101
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,507
Of course, from snowflakes

102
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,849
it's only one small step to folding and cutting frieze patterns,

103
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,049
and then wallpaper patterns,

104
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,186
and hey, what kinds of patterns do you get?

105
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:57,722
if you start by folding stuff into a mobius strip?

106
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,634
And then maybe you'll want to start folding and cutting spheres,

107
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:00,634
and everything will be a mess.

108
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:03,473
So you'd better just stop. Now.
