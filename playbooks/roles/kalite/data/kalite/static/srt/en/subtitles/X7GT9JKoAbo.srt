1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,640
if the angles A, B, and C of a triangle
are in an arithmetic progression

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,540
and if a, b and c - lower case a, b and c
denote the length of the sides opposite to

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,050
the capital, the angles A - capital A, capital
B and capital C respectively

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,320
then what is the value of this expression
right over here so let's see if we can

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,449
work our way

6
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,710
through this, so let's just draw the triangle so
we have visualization of what all the letters

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,779
represent

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,290
so we have the angles A, B and C

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,660
so let me just draw them like this

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,170
so we have the angles A

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,239
B

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,380
and C and then the sides opposites them are the
lower case versions, so the side opposite the

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,040
capital A is lower case a

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,000
the side opposite to capital B is lower case
b and the side opposite to the angle capital

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,610
C is

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,870
lower case c. Now the first piece of information
they tell us is that they

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,409
the angles

18
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:59,850
capital A, capital B and capital C of the
triangle

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,350
are in an

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,129
arithmetic progression

21
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,380
arithmetic

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,810
progression

23
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,880
very fancy word

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,570
but all an arithmetic progression is, is a series of numbers
that are separated by the same amount, so

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,380
and let me give you some examples, so 1,2,3 - that's an arithmetic progression

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,260
2, 4, 6

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,119
arithmetic progression were separated by 2
every time

28
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,400
i could do 10, 20, 30

29
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,270
also an arithmetic progression. These are all
arithmetic progressions. So all they're saying

30
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,080
is

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,272
is to go from angle A to angle B - however much
that is, is this the same amount to go from angle

32
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:37,680
B to angle C. So let's see

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,279
what that tells us

34
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:44,100
what that tells us about or maybe tells us, maybe doesn't tell us anything about those angles

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,820
so if we could say

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,439
we could say we have angle A

37
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,479
and then we have the notion angle B

38
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,720
so we could say that B is equal to A plus

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,240
some constant we don't know what that is. it could go by 1, it could go by 2, it could go by 10

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,330
we don't know what it is, so A plus N

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,750
and then C

42
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,750
would be equal to B plus N

43
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,550
which is the same thing

44
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,689
which is the same thing as B is A plus N, so this is A plus N
it plus

45
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,709
plus N which is equal to

46
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,489
A plus

47
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,809
2N

48
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:23,809
so what does that tell us? Well, the other thing
we know about three angles in a triangle

49
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:28,439
that they have to add up to a 180
degrees. So:

50
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,040
this, this and this have to add up to a 180 degrees

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,725
let's try it out so we have

52
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,870
A plus A plus N

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,019
plus A plus 2N, plus A plus 2N is going to be equal to 180 degrees

54
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,249
we have one, two, three "A"s here, so we get 3A

55
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:51,069
plus with one N and another two N: three A plus 3 N

56
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,769
is equal to 180 degrees

57
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,849
or you could divide both sides by 3 and you
get A

58
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,099
plus N is equal to

59
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,730
A plus N is equal to 60 degrees

60
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,739
so what does that

61
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,559
what does that tell us

62
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:10,370
well A could still be anything cause if N is 1 then A is 59

63
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,889
if N is 10

64
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,569
then A is going to be 50, so it doesn't give us much information

65
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,679
about the angle A

66
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,929
but if you look up here, do you see A+N anywhere?

67
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:26,039
you see it right over here. B is equal to
A plus N and we just figured out that

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,269
A plus N has to be equal to sixty degrees

69
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,909
so using this first piece of information we
are able to come up with something pretty

70
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:33,749
tangible

71
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:39,489
B must be equal to sixty degrees and you
could try it out with a bunch of numbers these

72
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:40,509
could be

73
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,019
59

74
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:42,749
60

75
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:43,859
and 61

76
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,660
that's an arithmetic progression

77
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,379
and once again B is the middle one
right over here. These could be 50

78
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,180
60

79
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,110
and 70

80
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,689
could be 40

81
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,859
60

82
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,330
and 80

83
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,510
but no matter what the arithmetic progression
is in order for these three angles to add

84
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,629
up to 180 the middle one

85
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,319
has to be equal to

86
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,229
has to be equal to 60 degrees. So that was
a pretty

87
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:10,939
that's.. we're doing pretty well so far so let's
see what we can do at the next part

88
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:15,209
with the next part of problem. I'm trying to save some screen real estate right over here

89
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:15,819
okay

90
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,669
so they want us to figure out the value of
the expression a over c sine of two

91
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,069
C - capital C, plus c over a sine of two A. So
let me just write it down

92
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,419
so we have

93
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,120
i'll do it.. i'll do it in blue

94
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,949
a over c

95
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,819
a over c

96
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:33,770
sine

97
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,550
of two times capital C

98
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,320
plus c over a

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,129
sine

100
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,550
of two times capital A

101
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,729
what's that going to be equal to? so, whenever
you see stuff like this you got a 2 here

102
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:48,299
a 2 here

103
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:51,819
frankly the best things you should do is just experiment
with your trigonometric identities and see

104
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,450
if anything pops out of you that might be
useful

105
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,660
and a little bit of a clue here the first
part of the problem helped us figure out what

106
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,279
B is

107
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,689
it helped us figure out what B is

108
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,489
but right now the expression has no B in it.
So right now this information seems kind of

109
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:06,220
useless

110
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,890
but if we could

111
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,050
put this somehow in terms of B

112
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,219
then we'll have will will be making progress
as we know information about angle B

113
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:15,860
so let's see what we can do

114
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,840
so the first thing

115
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,439
i would use is

116
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,110
well sine of 2A - let me just rewrite each
of these

117
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,919
so sine of

118
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,960
i just say sine of two times anything

119
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,009
that's just the same thing as

120
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,789
and this is called the double angle formula

121
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,209
so this is

122
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:35,839
i might be wrong i was for the actual
names of them but sine of two time something

123
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,629
is two

124
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,369
sine

125
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:39,759
of that something

126
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,620
times the cosine of that

127
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,990
times the cosine of that something and you'll
see that in any trigonometric book on the

128
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,399
inside cover even a lot of calculus books

129
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,189
let's do that for this the same thing right
over here so sine of 2A over here is going

130
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:52,339
to be

131
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,179
2 sine of

132
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,699
A

133
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:56,539
cosine of A

134
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:58,800
that's just a standard trigonometric identity

135
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,400
and we, in the trigonometric, less we prove
that identity i think we do it multiple times

136
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,240
then out on front we have our coefficients till we have a over c times this

137
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,779
plus c over a times this

138
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,400
now is there anything we can do and remember
in the back of our mind we should be thinking

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,030
of how can we use this information that be is
equal to sixty

140
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,649
so if we can somehow put this

141
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,910
in the form

142
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,190
got a b here

143
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,560
when i think about how do you get a b here
I think well

144
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,479
you know we have a triangle here so the things
that relate the sides of the triangle when

145
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,490
especially when it's not a right triangle we are really gonna deal with the law of sines or law of cosines

146
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,509
and a law of sines let me just rewrite it over
here just for our reference

147
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:41,139
Law of sines would say sine of A

148
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,520
over a is equal to sine

149
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,639
of B over b which is equal to sine

150
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,930
of C

151
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,929
over c

152
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,289
And it looks like we might be able to use that
let me just read the law of cosine here

153
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,050
the law of cosine is c squared

154
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,849
it should look as a Pythagorean theorem with little
adjustment for the fact that is not a right triangle

155
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:05,929
So c squared is equal to a squared plus b
squared

156
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:06,720
minus

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,889
2 ab

158
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,249
cosine

159
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:15,479
cosine of C of capital C so it's law of sines and law of cosines, so let's if we can

160
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,710
somehow use both of these to put these in
terms of b which we have information about

161
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,430
well the first thing is

162
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,879
i could rewrite this so this is sine of C
over c and this is sine of A over a, so let

163
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,999
me do that

164
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,639
so i have

165
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,870
so i have the 2a

166
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,770
I have 2a

167
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,069
cosine of c let me write that separately

168
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,460
so that's 2a

169
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,809
cosine

170
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,960
cosine of

171
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,990
capital c

172
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,949
and then times

173
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,460
sine of C over c

174
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,949
times

175
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,270
with white sine

176
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,419
of c

177
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:52,259
that's a capital c

178
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,460
sine of capital c over lower case c, that's
that term and that term right over there

179
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,809
and then to that I'm adding

180
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,539
to that I'm adding let me do this the same thing over
here, I have two times

181
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,139
I'm going to separate

182
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,369
these guys out

183
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:10,029
Actually I wanted to do the sines so let me separate

184
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:13,860
I'm gonna separate this guy and in this guy out

185
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,839
and so I get plus

186
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,249
2c

187
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:18,959
cosine

188
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,180
of A

189
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,719
times sine of capital a over lower case a

190
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,589
times sine

191
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,669
of capital a over lower case a and what does this
do for me

192
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,189
Well look at the law of sines
right over there I have sine of C over c

193
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:36,230
that's that over there

194
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,279
and then I've sine of A over a and that's that over
there capital a over lower case a.

195
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,870
they're both equal to sign of B over b so we're making progress

196
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,309
we started introducing b into the equation

197
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:50,990
and that's what we actually have information about

198
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,370
so this

199
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,140
It could be rewritten a sine of be over b

200
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,150
so this is the same thing as sine

201
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,000
of capital b over lower case b

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,570
and this is the same thing a sine

203
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,910
of capital b over

204
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,640
lower case b and they're both

205
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,709
being multiplied

206
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,070
or both of these terms are multiplying

207
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,910
are being multiplied by that

208
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,090
2a cosine of capital c times that

209
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,810
and then plus

210
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,940
2c

211
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,920
it's a lower case c

212
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,340
cosine of capital a times that

213
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,150
so we can factor out the sine of B over b so let's do that, let's factor it out

214
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,360
so this is the same thing

215
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,280
as

216
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,160
it's the same thing as

217
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,510
2a

218
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,440
2a

219
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,650
and I really have a sense of what the next
step is so I'll leave a space here

220
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,760
2a times cosine of C

221
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,140
plus this and these are being multiplied I'll have 
some space there

222
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,770
plus 2c two lower case c

223
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,189
times the cosine of A

224
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,880
and all of this

225
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,440
all of this times

226
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,050
the sine

227
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,860
the sine of B over b and we already know that B is 60 degrees

228
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,390
so we can evaluate this

229
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,210
uh... pat

230
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,640
pretty easily but let's just continue

231
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,459
let's see if we can somehow put this

232
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,470
right over here in terms of b

233
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,180
well if you look over here we have 2a cosine of C

234
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,900
2c cosine of A

235
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,970
it's trying to look

236
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,730
pretty darn close

237
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,960
each of these terms look preety darn close to this part

238
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,040
to this part of the law of cosines over there and actually let's solve

239
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,400
for that part of the law of cosines

240
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,820
let's see what we could do

241
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,760
so if you add if you add

242
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,670
2ab cosine C to both sides you get 2ab

243
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,880
cosine of capital c

244
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,260
plus c squared is equal to a squared

245
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,930
plus b squared

246
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,870
or if you subtract c squared from both sides you get

247
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,790
2ab

248
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,480
cosine of capital c

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,760
is equal to a squared plus b squared
minus

250
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,130
c squared

251
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,020
and this is interesting and you know we can switch around the letters later on

252
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,480
but this looks pretty darn close to the so what if and this looks pretty darn close

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,050
to this except here we're dealing with
an a instead of the c, we've just switched

254
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,160
letters around

255
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,640
and we could rewrite this

256
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,360
actually let me rewrite it just for fun

257
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,050
i could rewrite this over here as

258
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,140
2

259
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,430
2cb

260
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,709
not rewrite I can swap the letters

261
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,620
times the cosine of A

262
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,189
you see I'm swaping the a(s) and the c(s) is equal to c squared plus b squared minus

263
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,180
a squared

264
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,630
there's nothing unique about the sides I can do this with all of the sides

265
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,080
so here

266
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,840
It's a big c here, you have an a and b out front

267
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,660
and then you have tha a squared plus b squared minus the small c squared, if you have the big A then you gonna have

268
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,580
the cb in the front and you're subtracting the a squared right over here

269
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,730
and this is useful because

270
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,880
this term right over here this term right
over here looks almost like this term over

271
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,580
here if we could just
multiply this by b

272
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,720
so let's do that we can multiply that by b

273
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,899
but let's multiply

274
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:08,240
this whole numerator this whole term by b(s)
if we multiply this whole term by b what do we get

275
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,600
we get a b there

276
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,550
we get

277
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,300
a b there

278
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,719
and of course you can just arbitrarily multiply an expression by b that'll change its value.

279
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:19,100
so what we could do is multiply the expression by b which we just did

280
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,710
we distributed the b across here but they were also divided by b

281
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,270
where which so I'll divide by b, that's an equivalent
of multiplying the denominator

282
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,509
the denominator there not b squared

283
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,720
that's equivalent of multiplying the denominator there by b. That simple thing is dividing it by b

284
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
We've multiplied it by b divided by b

285
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,920
That's the same thing

286
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,330
I'm just turning this into b squared

287
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,930
now what does this give us

288
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,000
well we have this term right over here

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,190
this term right over here is now the exact
same thing is that over there

290
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,400
so it is now in a squared plus b squared
minus c squared

291
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,260
and then this term

292
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,399
right over here

293
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,249
is now the exact same thing as this thing over here which is the same thing as that

294
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,240
We're using the law of

295
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,410
cosines so this is plus

296
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,750
c squared plus b squared minus

297
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,310
a squared

298
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,630
and then all of that times this sine of b

299
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,590
sine of capital b over b squared

300
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,430
now what does this give us the we have an a squared and a negative a squared things are starting

301
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,020
to simplify

302
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,510
a squared negative a squared

303
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,530
we have a negative c squared and a positive c squared

304
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,670
so what are we left with we're just left out with the 2b squared so our whole expression

305
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,940
has simplified to

306
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,730
2b squared sine of B

307
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,730
sine of capital b

308
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,650
over

309
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,420
lower case b squared

310
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,710
these cancel out

311
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,500
so our whole expression simplifies to

312
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,089
2 sine of B

313
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,569
and from from the get go we knew what b was we know it's sixty degrees so this is

314
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:56,900
equal to two times

315
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,070
the sine of sixty degrees and if you
don't have the sine of sixty degrees memorized

316
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,490
you can always just break out of thirty sixty
ninety triangle

317
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,040
so let me draw

318
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,039
this is a right triangle right over here this is
sixty degrees

319
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,230
hypotenuse has length one we're dealing with
the unit circle

320
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,159
this side is thirty degrees

321
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,010
the side opposite to the thirty degrees is one-half

322
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:22,880
the side opposite to the sixty degrees is square root of three times that so it's a sqaure root of three over two

323
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,690
You can even use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out

324
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,520
when you know one of them you could figure out the other one

325
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,489
So it's the sine of, sinus

326
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:33,820
opposite over hypotenuse so square root of three
over two over one

327
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,430
Or just square root of three over two, so this is equal to two

328
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,380
times

329
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,360
there's a home stretch, it;s very exciting !

330
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,940
square root of three over two

331
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,220
these cancel out so we are left with

332
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,690
the square root

333
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,770
of three

334
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,910
that's a pretty neat problem and just in case you're curious this came from the

335
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,890
two thousand ten IIT joint entrance examination

336
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,730
hard to get into engineering and
science universities in India

337
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,459
and they gave this example like you know hundreds of thousands of kids and you know the top

338
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,889
the top i don't know like two thousand actually get into one of the ideas but anyway I just thought

339
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,899
it was a pretty pretty neat problem
