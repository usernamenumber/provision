1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,150
Let's apply everything we've
learned to an actual

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,390
differential equation.

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,850
Instead of just taking Laplace
transforms and taking their

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,940
inverse, let's actually
solve a problem.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,880
So let's say that I have the
second derivative of my

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:22,550
function y plus 4 times my
function y is equal to sine of

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:36,370
t minus the unit step function
0 up until 2 pi of t times

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,890
sine of t minus 2 pi.

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,120
Let's solve this differential
equation, an

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,870
interpretation of it.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,950
And I actually do a whole
playlist on interpretations of

13
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,440
differential equations and how
you model it, but you know,

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,490
you can kind of view this
is a forcing function.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,830
That it's a weird forcing
function of this being applied

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,280
to some weight with, you
know, this is the

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,470
acceleration term, right?

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,490
The second derivative with
respect to time is the

19
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,290
acceleration.

20
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,540
So the mass would be 1 whatever
units, and then as a

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,340
function of its position, this
is probably some type of

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,150
spring constant.

23
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,210
Anyway, I won't go there.

24
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,650
I don't want to waste your time
with the interpretation

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,860
of it, but let's solve it.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,600
We can do more about
interpretations later.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
So we're going take the Laplace
transform of both

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,340
sides of this equation.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,550
So what's the Laplace
transform of

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,610
the left-hand side?

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,680
So the Laplace transform of the
second derivative of y is

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,530
just s squared, so now I'm
taking the Laplace transform

33
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,880
of just that.

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,570
The Laplace transform of s
squared times the Laplace

35
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:45,110
transform of y minus-- lower the
degree there once-- minus

36
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:52,170
s times y of 0 minus
y prime of 0.

37
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,520
So clearly, I must have to
give you some initial

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,980
conditions in order to
do this properly.

39
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:05,490
And then plus 4 times the
Laplace transform of y is

40
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,979
equal to-- what's the Laplace
transform of sine of t?

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,690
That should be second
nature by now.

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,530
It's just 1 over s
squared plus 1.

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,160
And then we have minus
the Laplace

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,790
transform of this thing.

45
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,390
And I'll do a little side note
here to figure out the Laplace

46
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,020
transform of this thing
right here.

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,630
And we know, I showed it to you
a couple of videos ago, we

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:39,320
showed that the Laplace
transform-- actually I could

49
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,370
just write it out here.

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,290
This is going to be the same
thing as the Laplace transform

51
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,510
of sine of t, but we're going to
have to multiply it by e to

52
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,130
the minus-- if you remember that
last formula-- e to the

53
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,520
minus cs, where c is 2 pi.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,480
Actually, let me write
that down.

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
I decided to write it down,
then I decided, oh, no, I

56
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,080
don't want to do this.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,110
But let me write that.

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,940
So the Laplace transform of the
unit step function that

59
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,950
goes up to c times some function
shifted by c is equal

60
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,240
to e to the minus cs times the
Laplace transform of just the

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,510
original function times the
Laplace transform of f of t.

62
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,600
So if we're taking the Laplace
transform of this

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,330
thing, our c is 2 pi.

64
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:37,690
Our f of t is just
sine of t, right?

65
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,240
So then this is just going to
be equal to-- if we just do

66
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,630
this piece right here-- it's
going to be equal to e to the

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:53,480
minus cs-- our c is 2 pi-- e to
the minus 2 pi s times the

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,270
Laplace transform of f of t. f
of t is just sine of t before

69
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,120
we shifted.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,340
This is f of t minus 2 pi.

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,090
So f of t is just going
to be sine of t.

72
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,340
So it's going to be times
1 over s squared plus 1.

73
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,860
This is the Laplace transform
of sine of t.

74
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,000
So let's go back to where
we had left off.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,490
So we've taken the Laplace
transform of both sides of

76
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,490
this equation.

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,870
And clearly, I have some initial
conditions here, so

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,420
the problem must have given me
some and I just forgot to

79
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,290
write them down.

80
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,190
So let's see, the initial
conditions I'm given, and they

81
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,150
are written kind of in the
margin here, they tell us--

82
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,340
I'll do it in orange, they tell
us that y of 0 is equal

83
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,310
to 0, and y prime of
0 is equal to 0.

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,090
That makes the math easy.

85
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,110
That's 0 and that's 0.

86
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,550
So let's see if I can simplify
my equation.

87
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,290
So the left-hand side,
let's factor

88
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,920
out the Laplace transform.

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,440
So let's factor out this
term and that term.

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,760
So we get the Laplace transform
of y times this plus

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,740
this times s squared plus 4 is
equal to the right-hand side.

92
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,130
And what's the right-hand
side?

93
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,270
   

94
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,570
We could simplify this.

95
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,650
Well, I'll just write it out.

96
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,170
I don't want to do too
many steps at once.

97
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:30,180
It's 1 over s squared plus 1
and then plus-- or minus

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,420
actually, this is a minus--
minus the Laplace transfer of

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:39,010
this thing, which was e to
the minus 2 pi s over s

100
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,720
squared plus 1.

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,510
   

102
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,190
So if we divide both sides of
this equation by the s squared

103
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:55,650
plus 4, then we get the Laplace
transform of y is

104
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,620
equal to-- and actually, I
can just merge these two.

105
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,810
They're the same denominator.

106
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,700
So before I even divide by
s squared plus 4, that

107
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,090
right-hand side will
look like this.

108
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,410
It will look like with a
denominator of s squared plus

109
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:19,280
1 and you have a numerator of 1
minus e to the minus 2 pi s.

110
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,150
And, of course, we're dividing
both sides of this equation by

111
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,260
s squared plus 4, so we're going
to have to stick that s

112
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,150
squared plus 4 over here.

113
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,610
Now, we're at the hard part.

114
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,910
In order to figure out why, we
have to take the inverse

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,140
Laplace transform
of this thing.

116
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,620
So how do we take the
inverse Laplace

117
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,720
transform of this thing?

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,400
That's where the hard part is
always, you know, it makes

119
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,060
solving the differential
equation's easy if you know

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,213
the Laplace transforms. So it
looks like we're going to have

121
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,040
to do some partial fraction
expansion.

122
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,290
So let's see if we
can do that.

123
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,675
So we can rewrite this
equation right here.

124
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:56,830
   

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,670
Actually, let's write it as
this, because this'll kind of

126
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,250
simplify our work.

127
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,710
Let's factor this
whole thing out.

128
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,370
So we're going to write it as 1
minus e to the minus 2 pi s,

129
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,340
all of that times-- I'll do it
in orange-- all of that times

130
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:21,940
1 over s squared plus 1 times
s squared plus 4.

131
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,410
Now, we need to do some partial
fraction expansion to

132
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,430
simplify this thing
right here.

133
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,260
We're going to do this
on the side.

134
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,390
Maybe I should do this over
on the right here.

135
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,300
This thing-- let me rewrite it--
1 over s squared plus 1

136
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,990
times s squared plus 4 should be
able to be rewritten as two

137
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,100
separate fractions, s squared
plus 1 and s squared plus 4,

138
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,680
with the numerators.

139
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,070
This one would be As plus B.

140
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,770
It's going to have to have
degree 1, because

141
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,600
this is degree 2.

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,700
Here And then we'd
have Cs plus D.

143
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:11,360
And so when you add these two
things up, you get As plus B

144
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:23,000
times s squared plus 4 plus Cs
plus D times s squared plus 1,

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,870
all of that over the
common denominator.

146
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,330
We've seen this story before.

147
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,650
We just have to do some
algebra here.

148
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,520
As you can tell, these
differential equations

149
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,190
problems, they require
a lot of stamina.

150
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,830
You kind of just have to say I
will keep moving forward and

151
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,700
do the algebra that I need to do
in order to get the answer.

152
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,950
And you kind of have to get
excited about that notion that

153
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,570
you have all this
algebra to do.

154
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,660
So let's figure it out.

155
00:08:49,660 --> 00:09:00,200
So this top can be simplified
to As to the third plus Bs

156
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:10,570
squared plus 4As plus 4B.

157
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:19,330
And then this one, you end up
with Cs to the third plus Ds

158
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,850
squared plus Cs plus D.

159
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,350
So when you add of these up
together, you get-- and this

160
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,410
is all the algebra that we have
to do, for better, for

161
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:43,510
worse-- A plus C over s to the
third plus B plus D times s

162
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:49,920
squared plus 4A plus C times s--
let's scroll over a little

163
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,770
bit-- plus 4B plus D.

164
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,730
And now we just have to say,
OK, all of this is equal to

165
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,710
this thing up here.

166
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,770
This is the numerator.

167
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,140
We just simplified
the numerator.

168
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,050
This is the numerator.

169
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,840
That's the numerator
right there.

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,740
And all of this is going to be
over your original s squared

171
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,280
plus 1 times your s
squared plus 4.

172
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,150
And we established that this
thing should be-- let me just

173
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:23,610
write this-- that 1 over s
squared plus 1 times s squared

174
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,240
plus 4 should equal
this thing.

175
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,010
And then you just pattern match
on the coefficients.

176
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,420
This is all just intense partial
fraction expansion.

177
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,190
And you say, look, A plus C is
the coefficient of the s cubed

178
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,610
terms. I don't see any
s cubed terms here.

179
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,180
So A plus C must
be equal to 0.

180
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,070
And then you see, OK, B plus D
is the coefficient of the s

181
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,010
squared terms. I don't see any
s squared terms there.

182
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,670
So B plus D must
be equal to 0.

183
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,220
4A plus C, the coefficient of
the s terms. I don't see any s

184
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,070
terms over here.

185
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,080
So 4A plus C must
be equal to 0.

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,490
And then we're almost done.

187
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,490
4B plus D must be the constant
terms. There is a constant

188
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,530
term there.

189
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,465
So 4B plus D is equal to 1.

190
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:12,490
So let's see if we can
do anything here.

191
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,680
If we subtract this from that,
we get minus 3A is equal to 0,

192
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,160
or A is equal to 0.

193
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,840
If A is equal to 0, then
C is equals to 0.

194
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
And let's see what
we can get here.

195
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,010
If we subtract this from
that, we get minus 3B.

196
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,020
The D's cancel out.

197
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,290
It's equal to minus 1,
or B is equal to 1/3.

198
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,470
And then, of course, we have D
is equal to minus B, if you

199
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,550
subtract B from both sides.
so D is equal to 1/3.

200
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,960
So all of that work, and
we actually have a

201
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
pretty simple result.

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,190
   

203
00:11:52,190 --> 00:12:00,660
Our equation, this thing here,
can be rewritten as-- the A

204
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,630
disappeared.

205
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,130
It's 1/3 over s squared
plus 1.

206
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,490
B was the coefficient on the--
let me make it very clear.

207
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,230
B was the coefficient on the--
or it was a term on top of the

208
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,400
s squared plus 1, so that's
why I'm using B there.

209
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,730
And then D is minus B,
so D is minus 1.

210
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,510
So let me make sure
I have that.

211
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,060
B is 1/3 minus-- let me make
sure I get that right.

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,260
D is 1/3.

213
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,830
So, sorry, B as in boy is
1/3, so D is minus 1/3.

214
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,930
So B, there's a term on top
of the s squared plus 1.

215
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,560
And then you have minus D over
the minus 1/3 over s

216
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,510
squared plus 4.

217
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,560
This takes a lot of stamina
to record this video.

218
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,370
I hope you appreciate it.

219
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,090
OK, so let me rewrite
everything, just so we can get

220
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,450
back to the problem because
when you take the partial

221
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,740
fraction detour, you forget--
not even to speak of the

222
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,620
problem, you forget
what day it is.

223
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,810
Let's see, so you get the
Laplace transform of y is

224
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:20,060
equal to 1 minus e to the minus
2 pi s times what that

225
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,673
mess that we just solved
for, times-- and I'll

226
00:13:23,673 --> 00:13:24,360
write it like this.

227
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:34,440
1/3 times 1 over s squared
plus 1 minus 1/3 times--

228
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,470
actually, let me write
it this way.

229
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,190
Because I have this s squared
plus 4, so I really want to

230
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,880
have a 2 there.

231
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
So I want to have a 2 in the
numerator, so you want to have

232
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,825
a 2 over s squared plus 4.

233
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,690
So if I put a 2 in the numerator
there, I have to

234
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,440
divide this by 2 as well.

235
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,140
So let me change this to a 6.

236
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,690
Minus 1/6 times 2
is minus 1/3.

237
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,800
So I did that just so I get
this in the form of the

238
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,860
Laplace transform
of sine of t.

239
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,920
Now, let's see if there's
anything that

240
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,090
I can do from here.

241
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,640
This is an epic problem.

242
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,750
I'll be amazed if I don't
make a careless

243
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,320
mistake while I do this.

244
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,170
So we can rewrite everything.

245
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,280
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

246
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,880
And by simplifying it, I'm just
going to make it longer.

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,400
We can write the Laplace
transform of y is equal to--

248
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,640
I'm just going to multiply the
1 out, and then I'm going to

249
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,660
multiply the e to the
minus 2 pi s out.

250
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,540
So if you multiply the 1 out,
you get 1/3 times 1 over s

251
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,840
squared plus 1-- I'm just
multiplying the 1 out-- minus

252
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,060
1/6-- these are all the 1's
times the 1-- times 2 over s

253
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,020
squared plus 4.

254
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,660
And then I'm going to multiply
the minus e.

255
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,670
Let me just switch colors,
do the minus e.

256
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:06,820
So then you get minus e to the
minus 2 pi s over 3 times 1

257
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,430
over s squared plus 1.

258
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,860
And then the minus and the minus
cancel out, so you get

259
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:20,680
plus e to the minus 2 pi
s over 6 times 2 over s

260
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
squared plus 4.

261
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,630
Now, taking the inverse Laplace
transform of these

262
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,800
things are pretty
straightforward.

263
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,580
So let's do that.

264
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's take the inverse Laplace
transform of the whole thing.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,280
And we get y is equal to the
inverse Laplace transform of

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:44,390
this guy right here, is just 1/3
sine of t-- I don't have

267
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,330
to write a parentheses there--
sine of t, and then this is

268
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:56,590
minus 1/6 times-- this
is the Laplace

269
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,840
transform of sine of 2t.

270
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,820
   

271
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,730
That's that term right there.

272
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,410
Now, these are almost the same,
but we have this little

273
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,700
pesky character over here.

274
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,250
We have this e to the
minus 2 pi s.

275
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,486
And there, we just have to
remind ourselves-- I'll write

276
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:13,550
it here in the bottom.

277
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,520
We just have to remind ourselves
that the Laplace

278
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,380
transform of the unit step
function-- I'll put the pi

279
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:28,470
there, just 2 pi times f of t
minus 2 pi-- I should put as

280
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:36,260
the step function of t-- is
equal to e to the minus 2 pi s

281
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,865
times the Laplace transform of
just-- or let me just write it

282
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:45,860
this way-- times the Laplace
transform of f of t.

283
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,040
So if we view f of t as just
sine of t or sine of 2t, then

284
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,290
we can kind of backwards
pattern match.

285
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,790
And we'll have to shift
it and multiply it by

286
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,500
the unit step function.

287
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,050
So I want to make that clear.

288
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,690
If you didn't have this guy
here, the inverse Laplace

289
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,010
transform of this guy would be
the same thing as this guy.

290
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,110
It'd just be sine of t.

291
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,210
The inverse Laplace transform
of this guy

292
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,579
would be sine of 2t.

293
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,450
But we have this pesky
character here, which

294
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,079
essentially, instead of having
the inverse Laplace transform

295
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,190
just being our f of t, it's
going to be our f of t shifted

296
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,510
by 2 pi times the unit
step function, where

297
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,050
it steps up at 2pi.

298
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:34,340
So this is going to be minus
1/3 times the unit step

299
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,010
function, where c is 2 pi of t
times-- instead of sine of t--

300
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:46,150
sine of t minus 2pi.

301
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,170
And then we're almost done.

302
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,660
I'll do it in magenta
to celebrate it.

303
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:58,030
Plus this very last term, which
is 1/6 times the unit

304
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,550
step function 2 pi of t, the
unit step function that steps

305
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:13,780
up at 2 pi times sine of-- and
we have to be careful here.

306
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,990
Wherever we had a t before,
we're going to replace it with

307
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,750
a t minus 2 pi.

308
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,850
So sine of, instead of
2t, is going to be 2

309
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,270
times t minus 2 pi.

310
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,540
And there you have it.

311
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,650
We finally have solved our
very hairy problem.

312
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,600
We could take some time
if we want to simplify

313
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,250
this a little bit.

314
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,780
In fact, we might as well.

315
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,580
At the risk of making a careless
mistake at the last

316
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,690
moment, let me see if I can make
any simplifications here.

317
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,350
   

318
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,470
Well, we could factor out this
guy right here, but other than

319
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,090
that, that seems about as
simple as we can get.

320
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,180
So this is our function of t
that satisfies our otherwise

321
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,330
simple-looking differential
equation that we had up here.

322
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,850
This looked fairly
straightforward, but we got

323
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,340
this big mess to actually
satisfy that equation, given

324
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,130
those initial conditions
that we had initially.
