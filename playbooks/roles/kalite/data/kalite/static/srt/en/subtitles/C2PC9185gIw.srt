1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,870
I've talked a lot about the idea
that eigenvectors could

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,650
make for good bases or
good basis vectors.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,610
So let's explore that idea
a little bit more.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,230
Let's say I have some
transformation.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,310
Let's say it's a transformation
from Rn to Rn,

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,010
and it can be represented
by the matrix, A.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,340
So the transformation of x
is equal to the n-by-n

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,520
matrix, A times x.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,830
Now let's say that we have
n linearly independent

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,430
eigenvectors of A.

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,320
And this isn't always going to
be the case, but it can often

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,940
be the case.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,370
It's definitely possible.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:53,460
Let's assume that A has
n linearly independent

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,710
eigenvectors.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,680
   

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,980
So I'm going to call them v1,
v2, all the way through vn.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:13,450
Now, n linearly independent
vectors in Rn can definitely

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,610
be a basis for Rn.

21
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,980
We've seen that multiple
times.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,510
And what I want to show you in
this video is that this makes

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,410
a particularly good basis
for this transformation.

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,970
So let's explore that.

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,140
So the transformation of each of
these vectors-- I'll write

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,240
it over here.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,250
The transformation of vector 1
is equal to A times vector 1

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,130
and since vector 1 is an
eigenvector of A, that's going

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,040
to be equal to some eigenvalue
lambda 1 times vector 1.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,300
We could do that for
all of them.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,430
The transformation of vector 2
is equal to A times v2, which

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,550
is equal to some eigenvalue
lambda 2 times v2.

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,120
And I'm just going to skip all
of them and just go straight

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,960
to the nth one.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,850
We have n of these
eigenvectors.

36
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,900
You might have a lot more.

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,630
We're just assuming that A
has at least n linearly

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,750
independent eigenvectors.

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,785
In general, you could take
scaled up versions of these

40
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,780
and they'll also be
eigenvectors.

41
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,640
Let's see, so the transformation
of vn is going

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
to be equal to A times vn.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,860
And because these are all
eigenvectors, A times vn is

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,580
just going to be lambda n,
some eigenvalue times the

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,810
vector, vn.

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,820
Now, what are these
also equal to?

47
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,910
Well, this is equal to, and this
is probably going to be

48
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,360
unbelievably obvious to you, but
this is the same thing as

49
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,210
lambda 1 times vn plus 0
times v2 plus all the

50
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,760
way to 0 times vn.

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,440
And this right here is going to
be 0 times v1 plus lambda 2

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,010
times v2 plus all the way,
0 times all of the

53
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,660
other vectors vn.

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,170
And then this guy down here,
this is going to be 0 times v1

55
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,940
plus 0 times v2 plus 0 times
all of these basis vectors,

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,240
these eigenvectors, but
lambda n times vn.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,060
This is almost stunningly
obvious, right?

58
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,400
I just rewrote this as this plus
a bunch of zero vectors.

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,110
But the reason why I wrote that
is, because in a second,

60
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,410
we're going to take this as a
basis and we're going to find

61
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,860
coordinates with respect to that
basis, and so this guy's

62
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,180
coordinates will be lambda 1,
0, 0, because that's the

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,050
coefficients on our
basis vectors.

64
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,620
So let's do that.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,760
So let's say that we define
this as some basis.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,775
So B is equal to the set of--
actually, I don't even have to

67
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,780
write it that way.

68
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,990
Let's say I say that B,
I have some basis B,

69
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,330
that's equal to that.

70
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,710
What I want to show you is that
when I do a change of

71
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,260
basis-- we've seen this before--
in my standard

72
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,380
coordinates or in coordinates
with respect to the standard

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,520
basis, you give me some vector
in Rn, I'm going to multiply

74
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,130
it times A, and you're
going to have the

75
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,600
transformation of it.

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,130
It's also going to be in Rn.

77
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,705
Now, we know we can do
a change of basis.

78
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:10,230
   

79
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,370
And in a change of basis, if you
want to go that way, you

80
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,610
multiply by C inverse, which
is-- remember, the change of

81
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,529
basis matrix C, if you want to
go in this direction, you

82
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,950
multiply by C.

83
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,640
The change of basis matrix is
just a matrix with all of

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,920
these vectors as columns.

85
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,430
It's very easy to construct.

86
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,890
But if you change your basis
from x to our new basis, you

87
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,810
multiply it by the
inverse of that.

88
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,070
We've seen that multiple
times.

89
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,210
If they're all orthonormal, then
this is the same thing as

90
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,930
a transpose.

91
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,600
We can't assume that, though.

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,800
And so this is going to
be x in our new basis.

93
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,810
And if we want to find some
transformation, if we want to

94
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,810
find the transformation matrix
for T with respect to our new

95
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,970
basis, it's going to
be some matrix D.

96
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,510
And if you multiply D times x,
you're going to get this guy,

97
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,670
but you're going to get the B
representation of that guy.

98
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,900
The transformation of the vector
x is B representation.

99
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,620
And if we want to go back and
forth between that guy and

100
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,880
that guy, if we want to go in
this direction, you can

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,030
multiply this times C, and
you'll just get the

102
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,300
transformation of x.

103
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,580
And if you want to go in that
direction, you could multiply

104
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
by the inverse of your change
of basis matrix.

105
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,110
We've seen this multiple
times already.

106
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,340
But what I've claimed or I've
kind of hinted at is that if I

107
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,960
have a basis that's defined by
eigenvectors of A, that this

108
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,910
will be a very nice matrix,
that this might be the

109
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,860
coordinate system that you want
to operate in, especially

110
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,410
if you're going to apply
this matrix a lot.

111
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,230
If you're going to do this
transformation on a lot of

112
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,080
different things, you're going
to do it over and over and

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,100
over again, maybe to the same
set, then it maybe is worth

114
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,070
the overhead to do the
conversion and just use this

115
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,350
as your coordinate system.

116
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,660
So let's see that this will
actually be a nice-looking,

117
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,700
easy-to-compute-with and
actually diagonal matrix.

118
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,060
So we know that the
transformation-- what is the

119
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,850
transformation of-- let's
write this in a bunch of

120
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,790
different formats.

121
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,700
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

122
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,590
So if I wanted to write the
transformation of v1 in B

123
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,410
coordinates, what would it be?

124
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,710
It's just going to be equal to--
well, these are the basis

125
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,380
vectors, right?

126
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,010
So it's the coefficient
on the basis vectors.

127
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,110
So it's going to be equal to
lambda 1, and then there's a

128
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,710
bunch of zeroes.

129
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,846
It's lambda 1 times v1 plus 0
times v2 plus 0 times v3, all

130
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:37,160
the way to 0 times vn.

131
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,520
That's what it's equal to.

132
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,200
But it's also equal to D, and
we can write D like this.

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,250
D is also a transformation
between Rn and Rn, just a

134
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,210
different coordinate system.

135
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,120
So D is going to just be a bunch
of column vectors d1,

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,790
d2, all the way through dn
times-- this is the same thing

137
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,680
as D times our B representation

138
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,030
of the vector v1.

139
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,720
But what is our B
representation

140
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,140
of the vector v1?

141
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,490
Well, the vector, v1 is just 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2 plus

142
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,360
0 times v3 all the way
to 0 times vn.

143
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,970
v1 is a basis vector.

144
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,900
That's just 1 times itself plus
0 times everything else.

145
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,240
So this is what its
representation is in the B

146
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,490
coordinate system.

147
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,350
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

148
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,370
And we've seen this before.

149
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,010
This is all a bit of review.

150
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,800
I might even be boring you.

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,420
This is just equal to 1 times
d1 plus 0 times d2 plus 0

152
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,570
times all the other columns.

153
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,270
This is just equal to d1.

154
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,985
So just like that, we have our
first column of our matrix D.

155
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:44,970
We could just keep doing that.

156
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,300
I'll do it multiple times.

157
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:55,810
The transformation of v2 in our
new coordinate system with

158
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,200
respect to our new basis is
going to be equal to-- well,

159
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,380
we know what the transformation
of v2 is.

160
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:10,330
It's 0 times v1 plus lambda 2
times v2 and then plus 0 times

161
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,580
everything else.

162
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,010
   

163
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,920
And that's the same thing as D,
d1, d2, all the way through

164
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,240
dn times our B representation
of vector 2.

165
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,910
Well, vector 2 is one of
the basis vectors.

166
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,669
It's just 0 times v1 plus 1
times v2 plus 0 times v3 all

167
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,864
the way, the rest is 0.

168
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:35,760
So what's this going
to be equal to?

169
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,539
This is 0 times d1 plus
1 times d2 and 0 times

170
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,550
everything else, so
it's equal to d2.

171
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,860
I think you get the
general idea.

172
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,450
I'll do it one more time
just to really

173
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,380
hammer the point home.

174
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,880
The transformation of the nth
basis vector, which is also an

175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,690
eigenvector of our original
matrix A or of our

176
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,030
transformation in standard
coordinates, in B coordinates,

177
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,710
is going to be equal to what?

178
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,370
Well, we wrote it
right up here.

179
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,110
It's going to be a
bunch of zeroes.

180
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,530
It's 0 times all of these guys
plus lambda n times vn.

181
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,580
And this is going to be this guy
d1, d2, all the way to dn

182
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,930
times the B representation of
the nth basis vector, which is

183
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,740
just 0 times v1, 0 times v2
and 0 times all of them,

184
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,970
except for 1 times vn.

185
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,790
And so this is going to be equal
to 0 times d1 plus 0

186
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,210
times d2 plus 0 times all
of these guys all the

187
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,520
way to 1 times dn.

188
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,570
So that's going to
be equal to dn.

189
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,810
And just like that, we know what
our transformation matrix

190
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,310
is going to look like with
respect to this new basis,

191
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,880
where this basis was defined or
it's made up of n linearly

192
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,730
independent eigenvectors of
our original matrix A.

193
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,560
So what does D look like?

194
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,700
Our matrix D is going to look
like-- its first column is

195
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,170
right there.

196
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,490
We figured that one out.

197
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,440
Lambda 1, and then we just
have a bunch of zeroes.

198
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,640
Its second column
is right here.

199
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,920
d2 is equal to this.

200
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,040
It's 0, lambda 2, and then
a bunch of zeroes.

201
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,610
And then this is in
general the case.

202
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,010
The nth column is going to have
a zero everywhere except

203
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,700
along the diagonal.

204
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,985
It's going to be lambda n.

205
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,620
It's going to be the eigenvalue
for the nth

206
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,210
eigenvector.

207
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,180
And so the diagonal is going to
look-- you're going to have

208
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,510
lambda 3 all the way
down to lambda n.

209
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,890
And our nth column is lambda n
with just a bunch of zeroes

210
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,560
everywhere.

211
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,130
So D, when we picked-- this
is a neat result.

212
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,990
If A has n linearly independent
eigenvectors, and

213
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,500
this isn't always the case,
but we can figure out that

214
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,380
eigenvectors and say, hey, I can
take a collection of n of

215
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,970
these that are linearly
independent, then those will

216
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,350
be a basis for Rn.

217
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,930
n linearly independent vectors
in Rn are a basis for Rn.

218
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,080
But when you use that basis,
when you use the linearly

219
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,320
independent eigenvectors of A
as a basis, we call this an

220
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,570
eigenbasis.

221
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,450
   

222
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,310
The transformation matrix with
respect to that eigenbasis, it

223
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,220
becomes a very, very
nice matrix.

224
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,230
This is super easy
to multiply.

225
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,050
It's super easy to invert.

226
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,370
It's super easy to take
the determinant of.

227
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,330
We've seen it multiple times.

228
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,900
It just has a ton of
neat properties.

229
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,820
It's just a good basis
to be dealing with.

230
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,030
So that's kind of the
big takeaway.

231
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,780
In all of linear algebra, we did
all this stuff with spaces

232
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,670
and vectors and all of that,
but in general, vectors are

233
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,100
abstract representations
of real world things.

234
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,010
You could represent a vector
as the stock returns or it

235
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,540
could be a vector of weather
in a certain part of the

236
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,730
country, and you can create
these spaces based on the

237
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,440
number of dimensions
and all of that.

238
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,090
And then you're going to
have transformations.

239
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,690
Sometimes, like when we learn
about Markov chains, your

240
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,780
transformations are essentially
what's the

241
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,910
probability after one time
increment that something state

242
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,980
will change to something else,
then you'll want to apply that

243
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,230
matrix many, many, many, many
times to see what the stable

244
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,520
state is for a lot of things.

245
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,660
And I know I'm not explaining
any of this to you well, but I

246
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,370
wanted to tell you that all of
linear algebra is really just

247
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,140
a very general way to solve a
whole universe of problems.

248
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,730
And what's useful about this is
you can have transformation

249
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,390
matrices that define
these functions

250
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,680
essentially on data sets.

251
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,260
And what we've learned now is
that when you look at the

252
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,130
eigenvectors and the
eigenvalues, you can change

253
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,640
your bases so that you can solve
your problems in much

254
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,360
simpler ways.

255
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,950
And I know it's all very
abstract right now, but you

256
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,560
now have the toolkit, and the
rest of your life, you have to

257
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,300
figure out how to apply this
toolkit to specific problems

258
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,510
in probability or statistics or
finance or modeling weather

259
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,960
systems or who knows
what else.

260
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,087
