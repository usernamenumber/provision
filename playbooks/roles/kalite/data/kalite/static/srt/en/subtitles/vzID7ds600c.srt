1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,080
Let's say we have
a cup of water.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,330
Let me draw the cup.

4
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,800
   

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,530
This is one side of the cup,
this is the bottom of the cup,

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,130
and this is the other
side of the cup.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,325
Let me say that it's
some liquid.

8
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:19,920
It doesn't have to be water,
but some arbitrary liquid.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,260
It could be water.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,850
That's the surface of it.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,570
We've already learned that the
pressure at any point within

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,970
this liquid is dependent
on how deep

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,580
we go into the liquid.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,450
One point I want to make before
we move on, and I

15
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,730
touched on this a little bit
before, is that the pressure

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,460
at some point isn't just acting
downwards, or it isn't

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,480
just acting in one direction.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,975
It's acting in all directions
on that point.

19
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:50,620
So although how far we go down
determines how much pressure

20
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,000
there is, the pressure is
actually acting in all

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,850
directions, including up.

22
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,330
The reason why that makes sense
is because I'm assuming

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,950
that this is a static system,
or that the fluids in this

24
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,500
liquid are stationary, or you
even could imagine an object

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,360
down here, and it's
stationary.

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,800
The fact that it's stationary
tells us that the pressure in

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,000
every direction must be equal.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,970
Let's think about a
molecule of water.

29
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,870
A molecule of water, let's say
it's roughly a sphere.

30
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,920
   

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,440
If the pressure were different
in one direction or if the

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,070
pressure down were greater than
the pressure up, then the

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,310
object would start accelerating
downwards,

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,950
because its surface area
pointing upwards is the same

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,240
as the surface area pointing
downwards, so the force

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,410
upwards would be more.

37
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,550
It would start accelerating
downwards.

38
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,520
Even though the pressure is a
function of how far down we

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,900
go, at that point,
the pressure is

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,150
acting in every direction.

41
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,790
Let's remember that, and now
let's keep that in mind to

42
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,530
learn a little bit about
Archimedes' principle.

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:01,840
Let's say I submerge a cube into
this liquid, and let's

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:13,370
say this cube has dimensions
d, so every side is d.

45
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,180
   

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,560
What I want to do is I want to
figure out if there's any

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,870
force or what is the net
force acting on this

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,070
cube due to the water?

49
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,770
Let's think about what the
pressure on this cube is at

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,980
different points.

51
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,760
At the depths along the side of
the cube, we know that the

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,310
pressures are equal, because
we know at this depth right

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,350
here, the pressure is going to
be the same as at that depth,

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,110
and they're going to offset each
other, and so these are

55
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,900
going to be the same.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,080
But one thing we do know, just
based on the fact that

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,480
pressure is a function of depth,
is that at this point

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,510
the pressure is going to be
higher-- I don't know how much

59
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,010
higher-- than at this point,
because this point is deeper

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,330
into the water.

61
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,275
Let's call this P1.

62
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:03,210
Let's call that pressure on top,
PT, and let's call this

63
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,260
point down here PD.

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,910
No, pressure on the
bottom, PB.

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,330
   

66
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,220
What's going to be the net
force on this cube?

67
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,330
The net force-- let's call that
F sub N-- is going to be

68
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,420
equal to the force acting
upwards on this object.

69
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,280
What's the force acting
upwards on the object?

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,830
It's going to be this pressure
at the bottom of the object

71
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,730
times the surface area at the
bottom of the object.

72
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,530
What's the surface area at
the bottom of the object?

73
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,930
That's just d squared.

74
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,770
Any surface of a cube is d
squared, so the bottom is

75
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:54,440
going to be d squared minus--
I'm doing this because I

76
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,850
actually know that the pressure
down here is higher

77
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,630
than the pressure here, so this
is going to be a larger

78
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,090
quantity, and that the net force
is actually going to be

79
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,430
upwards, so that's why I can
do the minus confidently up

80
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,570
here-- the pressure
at the top.

81
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,590
What's the force at the top?

82
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,620
The force at the top is going to
be the pressure on the top

83
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,750
times the surface area of
the top of the cube,

84
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,700
right, times d squared.

85
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,540
We can even separate out the d
squared already at that point,

86
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,980
so the net force is equal to
the pressure of the bottom

87
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,920
minus the pressure of the top,
or the difference in pressure

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,150
times the surface area of either
the top or the bottom

89
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,840
or really any of the
sides of the cube.

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,460
Let's see if we can figure
what these are.

91
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,770
Let's say the cube is submerged
h units or h meters

92
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,560
into the water.

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,780
So what's the pressure
at the top?

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,600
The pressure at the top is
going to be equal to the

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
density of the liquid-- I keep
saying water, but it could be

96
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,610
any liquid-- times how
far down we are.

97
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,080
So we're h units down, or maybe
h meters, times gravity.

98
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,700
And what's the pressure
the bottom?

99
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,060
The pressure at the bottom
similarly would be the density

100
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,600
of the liquid times the depth,
so what's the depth?

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,270
It would be this h and then
we're another d down.

102
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,226
   

103
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:29,480
It's h plus d-- that's our total
depth-- times gravity.

104
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,946
Let's just substitute both of
those back into our net force.

105
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:35,750
Let me switch colors to keep
from getting monotonous.

106
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,360
I get the net force is equal to
the pressure at the bottom,

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
which is this.

108
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:52,730
Let's just multiply it out, so
we get p times h times g plus

109
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,480
d times p times g.

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,580
   

111
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,910
I just distributed this out,
multiplied this out.

112
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,230
That's the pressure at the
bottom, then minus the

113
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:13,950
pressure at the top, minus phg,
and then we learned it's

114
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,860
all of that times d squared.

115
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,350
Immediately, we see something
cancels out.

116
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,905
phg, phg subtract.

117
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,950
It cancels out, so we're
just left with--

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,100
what's the net force?

119
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:36,000
The net force is equal to dpg
times d squared, or that

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,490
equals d cubed times
the density of the

121
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,740
liquid times gravity.

122
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,000
Let me ask you a question:
What is d cubed?

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,830
d cubed is the volume
of this cube.

124
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,780
And what else is it?

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,800
It's also the volume of
the water displaced.

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,680
If I stick this cube into the
water, and the cube isn't

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,050
shrinking or anything-- you
can even imagine it being

128
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,860
empty, but it doesn't have to be
empty-- but that amount of

129
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,640
water has to be moved out
of the way in order for

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,040
that cube to go in.

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,360
This is the volume of
the water displaced.

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,680
It's also the volume
of the cube.

133
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:24,200
   

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,010
This is the density-- I keep
saying water, but it could be

135
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,770
any liquid-- of the liquid.

136
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,560
This is the gravity.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,190
So what is this?

138
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,800
Volume times density is the mass
of the liquid displaced,

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
so the net force is
also equal to the

140
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,120
mass of liquid displaced.

141
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,260
Let's just say mass times
gravity, or we could say that

142
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,660
the net force acting on this
object is-- what's the mass of

143
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,120
the liquid displaced
times gravity?

144
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,750
That's just the weight
of liquid displaced.

145
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,030
That's a pretty interesting
thing.

146
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,990
If I submerge anything, the net
force acting upwards on

147
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,630
it, or the amount that I'm
lighter by, is equal to the

148
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,370
weight of the water
being displaced.

149
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,960
That's actually called
Archimedes' principle.

150
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,260
That net upward force due to
the fact that there's more

151
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,090
pressure on the bottom than
there is on the top, that's

152
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,280
called the buoyant force.

153
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,950
That's what makes
things float.

154
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,280
I'll leave you there to just to
ponder that, and we'll use

155
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,919
this concept in the next couple
of videos to actually

156
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,789
solve some problems.
