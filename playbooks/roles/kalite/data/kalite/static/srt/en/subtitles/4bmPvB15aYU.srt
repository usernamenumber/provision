1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:05,259
world war one shaped our world and many
many many ways as far as the wasn't that

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:10,370
long ago was not even one hundred years
ago but it was really the end of the

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,690
more traditional empires is the end of
kingdoms

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,860
it really reshaped much of the globes
muster up much more round states defined

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,269
by nations rather than states defined by
monarchies are states defined by empires

6
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:24,440
it was also

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,020
the first war were technology wrote in
modern technology technology has always

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,860
been a played a major role in wars
affected

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,620
wars have been a catalyst for technology
often and what was the person that much

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,350
of what we can surbhi modern technology
british huge role

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,650
in uh... the actual carrying out of the
warrant a larger this is what made the

12
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,630
war so much bloodier and and one could
argue even more protracted

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,190
so here i have a bunch of pictures of
the various technologies used in world

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,760
war one here in this picture you have

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,170
you have a machine gun

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,170
you have a machine gun which allowances
allows you to kind of

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,390
indiscriminately mow down folks these
guys are looks like they might be in

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,760
some type of a trench and so you could
imagine that combination is viewed from

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,330
above so let's say that this is a trench

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,159
this is a trench a rotary year we're
looking for a bar so there's some people

21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,010
sitting in the trench a couple of these
folks have machine guns the rest of the

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,300
guys just have

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,830
rifles over here

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,200
if you wanted a storm this trench you'd
be in a bad situation they got the

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,110
machine guns and she could just mow
people down

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,500
to just more people down they also
tended to use barb wire barb wire wasn't

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,110
invented in world rwanda's invented many
decades before the eighteen hundreds

28
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,150
but that would make it very hard for
someone to cross the spirit of they

29
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,670
would get stuck in it

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,400
and at which point these guys in the
trench could shoot 'em down and be very

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,500
hard to shoot the guys in the trench

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,759
so it also other than making it very
deadly and give all the advantages to

33
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,500
the the defense so anytime someone to
gain ground especially in one of france

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,319
where trench warfare was being used

35
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,390
is issues which usually finchley bloody
affair

36
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,189
the other

37
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,289
technology they became into mainstream
use in world war one was the use of gas

38
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:02,180
and in particular poison gas

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,530
poisons

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,460
poison gas

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,619
always and gas and as you see these
gentleman right over here they're

42
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,189
wearing gas masks

43
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:13,239
because they're afraid for their
opponent is going is poison gas and the

44
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,159
benefit of

45
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,229
of gas

46
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,380
in particular is

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,830
let's say you have an artillery shell
that you throw over a dozen hit anybody

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,090
but then it starts releasing it start
releasing a canister of a different kind

49
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,919
of and different

50
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,679
it start releasing a canister of gas of
the gas i've drawn

51
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,659
in this purplish color

52
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,189
until effect it doesn't have to be
directed at kansas linger there in in

53
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,769
fact that trench in effect everyone
there

54
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,430
gas warfare was actually the germans
were the first jesus just gas warfare

55
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,899
but they were the first two years

56
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:49,400
they really thought we would call poison
gas in particular nineteen fifteen

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,219
they use chlorine gas

58
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,699
same down chlorine

59
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,439
chlorine gas which immediately attacks
the respiratory system of the person who

60
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,310
hails at and a essentially choked to
death with and seconds or minutes

61
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,649
uh... they also used farce gene gas

62
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,199
because this actually did not in this
did not allow the very kind of did not

63
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,039
stimulate that choking the token reflex
in some ways it kind of infiltrate the

64
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:15,649
respiratory system even more have
delayed effect so did kind of linger

65
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:19,789
around and you have the use of mustard
gas mustard gas was very hard

66
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,110
to protect against

67
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,510
against it wouldn't kind of immediately
have you choke to death like chlorine

68
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,239
gas should be severe blistering this as
we take you take you out of the battle

69
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,299
is very hard to protect against and
would also linger around in the trash so

70
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,679
they can meet the trench a very kind of

71
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:38,689
like talks toxic environment to work in
cities are very very very ugly weapons i

72
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,029
mean it's

73
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:43,990
war itself is ugly weapons themselves
are ugly i mean the machine gun is not a

74
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,310
solid pleasant weapon at city can pick
and more people down um... but but even

75
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,620
folks who do something like a machine
gun is an acceptable thing

76
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,060
uh... tend to view these things is
particularly

77
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,929
particularly idly things lately things
to use

78
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:01,059
other weapons that show up in world war
one we talked about this and other

79
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:02,709
videos but the tank

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,980
started to become

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,260
a factor this right over here is an
american tank

82
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,000
obviously you know what these kind of

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,660
these these these trades a convicted
goin tough terrain

84
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,700
it's heavily heavily armored

85
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,430
uh... you could pick it kind of you know
when you talk about the stretch type of

86
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,370
thing well if you had a big hulking
beast maybe that could roll to the

87
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,320
barbed wire

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,230
and and and take some being in and maybe
eventually

89
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,390
so you could imagine a

90
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,800
a tank overhear that could eventually
action to take this time did not have

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,700
these kind of these big parts of the
mind of a something more like that

92
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,510
but this might be able to actually

93
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,629
be part of an offensive against attracts
like this

94
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,870
we talked excel extensively about

95
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,210
submarine warfare more won the germans
especially

96
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,469
used it as sensitive to get to have a
chance against the the dominant british

97
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:50,080
but they get saddam issue the dominant
british navy you understated u_-boat

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,729
warfare was one of the primary reasons
given by the americans as to why they

99
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:56,780
entered the war on the inside of on the
side of the untied

100
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,120
these are kind of world war one error
u<u>s</u> summer recess to give an idea of

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,589
how they act it looked

102
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:03,610
and probably

103
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,600
that in some ways the the the best for
shattering of of

104
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,440
would play a major major major role in
world and future wars

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,539
it was the

106
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,409
was the bringing up heavier than
aircraft into the wars in particular

107
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:20,409
talking about airplanes so before this
you have stuff like balloons and

108
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:21,249
saplings

109
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,139
use for reconnaissance

110
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:26,539
used to see where we should aim the
artillery things like that

111
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,629
but now

112
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:31,240
you had the right blood brothers only
frankly several years before inventing

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,610
the you know the they've issued the
engine powered heavier than air craft at

114
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,629
first the airplane in the beginning
stages the war was use for khana since

115
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,330
but as the technology improved as the
engines improved

116
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,080
it started the used for for bombing

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,999
sardar to use for air-to-air combat

118
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,470
and all of the folks involved and
air-to-air combat

119
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,699
this gentlemen

120
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,779
this gentleman right over here is
probably the most famous although you

121
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:58,949
might not recognize his name is he's
been kind of character

122
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,939
turn into a bit of a caricature and and
and the modern world but this is manfred

123
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:03,849
von

124
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,120
rigth told him

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,349
and he was a a a pilot or the germans

126
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,080
and he's more famously known as

127
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,729
the red baron

128
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:17,310
the red baron is call the red baron
because he was actually a barren and is

129
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,360
the title of mobility in imperial
germany and he painted his plane reds is

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,919
a picture of his plane right over here
so

131
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,579
potocari analysis isn't quite ready
should as you probably try to get a more

132
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,720
reddish color so maybe this is more of a
red

133
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,110
so that the colors on c_ black-and-white
photograph of me if i colored and for

134
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,889
you

135
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,750
you'll get more of the feeling of what
his plane might have looked like

136
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,930
knows a try plane at these three wings
over here

137
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,629
over three let levels of ranks whatever
his plane was read that's what is called

138
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:46,120
the red baron

139
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
and he was famous for

140
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,059
being the most the most

141
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:50,539
lethal pilot

142
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,800
in all of the warranties were kids
eighty confirmed

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,819
kills who is able to down indiana mere
crapster eighty

144
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:02,580
eighty confirmed wins i guess you could
say when in in in in combat which is

145
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,230
more than any other folks

146
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,360
in toward war once a very very famous
pilot

147
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,449
he himself and we're talking about any
of the combatants in ward one did not

148
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,300
have a long life expectancy

149
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,700
uh... the pilots especially this was a
dangerous game

150
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,020
and heat and he also despite being the
top pile at the top east

151
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,669
in in and almost all the pilot in world
war one he also

152
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,819
ended up getting shot in the air

153
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,979
in nineteen in teen hillary got shot in
the long term hearty somehow managed to

154
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:30,160
land his plane

155
