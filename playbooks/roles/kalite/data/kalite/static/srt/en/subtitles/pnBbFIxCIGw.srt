1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:05,603
(music)

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:07,830
And we’ve entered the church and in the

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,345
back corner to the right of the altar is the version

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:16,510
ended up as the tomb of Pope Julius the Second

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,353
with the figure by Michelangelo of Moses

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,362
And that accounts for the real popularity of this

7
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:25,278
church now, there is a lot of people here and

8
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:27,414
they are all here or virtually all here

9
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:28,769
to see the Michelangelo

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,148
And not the relics of Saint Peter’s chains

11
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,901
which probably would of drawn much

12
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,620
more interest just a few hundred years ago

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,366
And for the main sake of the church that’s right

14
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:39,102
but I’m not sure that Michelangelo would

15
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,282
have been entirely satisfied with

16
00:00:41,282 --> 00:00:43,883
what he made here because this is actually

17
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:48,586
really a fraction of what he originally expected this tomb to be

18
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:53,001
He made very grandiose designs for the tomb of

19
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,628
Pope Julius the Second, so Pope Julius the second

20
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:58,082
commissioned Michelangelo to design and sculpt figures

21
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:00,727
for the tomb; this might seem kind of weird for us

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,911
Today we have someone plan their own tomb and as elaborately

23
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,230
it seems kind of Egyptian does it?

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,785
It does but you know that rulers did that

25
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,946
they commissioned their tomb all the better to ensure

26
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,712
that their memories and their

27
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:16,615
achievements lived on in prosperity

28
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:19,077
Let’s take a look at this sculpture, he’s towering

29
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:21,917
He is towering, I think he is 8 feet sitting down

30
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:25,701
so one can only imagine how tall he would be standing up

31
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:30,583
He is wearing classical garb, he has a massive head

32
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,562
and you just can’t overstate the muscularity

33
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,132
and the sense of power of this figure

34
00:01:35,132 --> 00:01:39,280
He’s frighteningly powerful you can see these bulging muscles

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,333
in his arms, he’s a seated figure and yet there’s nothing relaxed about him

36
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,031
he’s filled with power and energy

37
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,529
And in fact as I look at it I really see this figure in

38
00:01:51,529 --> 00:01:53,869
transition so many of Michelangelo’s figures are

39
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,769
and he is seated but he is in my mind at least about to stand

40
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:03,387
Yeah he does look like he’s pushed his left leg back in order to prepare to rise

41
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:08,051
And it seems to me that he is rising in anger, under his right arm

42
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:10,518
you can see the two tablets of the law

43
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,753
The Ten Commandments

44
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:15,331
One can imagine that he is about to rise and throw them down

45
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,732
on the ground to shatter them, in his anger

46
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:20,203
He’s come from back down the mountain from his audience

47
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:23,311
with god and he’s received the laws and he sees

48
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:27,800
the Israelites who’s left behind have had reverted from the

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,568
monotheism that he is preaching, to a polytheism

50
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,478
worshipping the golden calf

51
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:36,164
And it’s his anger and his fury that I think that

52
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,413
Michelangelo is capturing so beautifully

53
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:43,702
It does appear to be staring at something with a lot of (intensity) intensity

54
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:46,897
the figure seems almost alive, the way he pulls his leg

55
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:53,034
back, his left arm comes in front of his body, his right hand pulls

56
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,998
his beard, his head turns to the left

57
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:59,379
Not a part of his body that’s not in motion (not engaged)

58
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,118
And that’s right and actually really supporting the

59
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:04,410
complexity of composition of the sculpture as a whole

60
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,181
Right and that’s something that I think about

61
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:08,023
that is just something typical of the high renaissance

62
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:11,393
is that kind of new, complexity of the human body

63
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:13,400
You can think about it in the early renaissance

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,550
artists just sort of figuring out contrapposto (Yeah and)

65
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,435
For the first time since the ancient Greeks and Romans

66
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,268
and here we have something so much so much more complicated

67
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,540
It’s almost a seated contrapposto, but even in the beard

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,666
even in the expression which gives energy and velocity and

69
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,431
and just the kind of extraordinary movement through the figure and

70
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:37,574
contrast areas of really deep carving, creating very rich shadows

71
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,849
this very dramatic of alternations between

72
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,752
the dark and the light, between textures, all of which I

73
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:46,737
think energizes this figure

74
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:49,801
It’s too bad that Michelangelo had many other responsibilities

75
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:53,067
and was unable to complete all of the figures that he

76
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,735
intended for the tomb of Pope Julius the Second but the ones

77
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,526
that he started and the one that he finished

78
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:01,129
Moses and the other ones that he started like the slaves for the

79
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:03,829
tomb are just amongst his masterpieces

80
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,246
It is breath taking

81
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:09,246
(music)
