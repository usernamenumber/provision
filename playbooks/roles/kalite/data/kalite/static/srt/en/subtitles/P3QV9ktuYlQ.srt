1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,460
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,490
So let's do a potential
energy problem with

4
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,510
a compressed spring.

5
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,060
So let's make this an
interesting problem.

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,220
Let's say I have
a loop-d-loop.

7
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,120
A loop-d-loop made out of ice.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,080
And I made it out of ice so that
we don't have friction.

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,330
Let me draw my loop-d-loop.

10
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,900
   

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,850
There's the loop, there's
the d-loop.

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,020
All right.

13
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,475
And let's say this loop-d-loop
has a radius of 1 meter.

14
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:34,220
Let's say this is-- this right
here-- is 1 meter.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,700
So of course the loop-d-loop
is 2 meters high.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,050
   

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,380
And let's say I have a
spring here-- it's

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,760
a compressed spring.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,200
Let's say this is the wall.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,942
This is my spring, it's
compressed, so it's

21
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,000
all tight like that.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,050
And let's say its spring
constant, k, is,

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,150
I don't know, 10.

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,650
Attached to that compressed
spring-- so I have a block of

25
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,860
ice, because I need ice on ice,
so I have no friction.

26
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,740
This is my block of
ice, shining.

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,930
And let's say the block of ice
is, I don't know, 4 kilograms.

28
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,860
And we also know that we are
on Earth, and that's

29
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,330
important, because this problem
might have been

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,660
different if we were
on another planet.

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,520
And my question to you is how
much do we have to compress

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,380
the spring-- so, let's say
that the spring's natural

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,000
state was here, right, if
we didn't push on it.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,230
And now it's here.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,740
So what is this distance?

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,800
How much do I have to compress
this spring, in order for when

37
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,615
I let go of the spring, the
block goes with enough speed

38
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:50,920
and enough energy, that it's
able to complete the

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,320
loop-d-loop, and reach safely
to the other end?

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
So, how do we do this problem?

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,440
Well, in order-- any loop-d-loop
problem, the hard

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,870
part is completing the
high point of the

43
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,240
loop-d-loop, right?

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,490
The hard part is making sure
you have enough velocity at

45
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,050
this point, so that you
don't fall down.

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,430
Your velocity has to offset the
downward acceleraton, in

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,530
which case-- and here, is going
to be the centripetal

48
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,320
acceleration, right?

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,740
So that's one thing
to think about.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,180
And you might say, wow this is
complicated, I have a spring

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,150
here, it's going to accelerate
the block.

52
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,720
And then the block's going to
get here, and then it's going

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
to decelerate, decelerate.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,720
This is probably where it's
going to be at its slowest,

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,610
then it's going to accelerate
back here.

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,430
It's a super complicated
problem.

57
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,400
And in physics, whenever you
have a super complicated

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,980
problem, it's probably because
you are approaching it in a

59
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,810
super complicated way,
but there might be a

60
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,610
simple way to do it.

61
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,980
And that's using energy--
potential and kinetic energy.

62
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,280
And what we learned when we
learned about potential and

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,190
kinetic energy, is that the
total energy in the system

64
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,520
doesn't change.

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,370
It just gets converted from
one form to another.

66
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,820
So it goes from potential
energy to kinetic

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,680
energy, or to heat.

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,890
And we assume that
there's no heat,

69
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,780
because there's no friction.

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,940
So let's do this problem.

71
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,970
So what we want to know is, how
much do I have to compress

72
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,760
this spring?

73
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,580
So what I'm essentially saying
is, how much potential energy

74
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,680
do I have to start off with--
with this compressed spring--

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,900
in order to make it up here?

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,310
So what's the potential
energy?

77
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,675
Let's say I compress the
spring x meters.

78
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:22,340
   

79
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,880
And in the last video, how
much potential energy

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,410
would I then have?

81
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,720
Well, we learned that the
potential energy of a

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,040
compressed spring-- and I'll
call this the initial

83
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,110
potential energy-- the initial
potential energy, with an i--

84
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,720
is equal to 1/2 kx squared.

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,180
And we know what k is.

86
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,140
I told you that the spring
constant for the spring is 10.

87
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:52,990
So my initial potential energy
is going to be 1/2 times 10,

88
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,240
times x squared.

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,010
   

90
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,340
So what are all of the energy
components here?

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,520
Well, obviously, at this point,
the block's going to

92
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,160
have to be moving, in order
to not fall down.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,990
So it's going to have
some velocity, v.

94
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,770
It's going tangential
to the loop-d-loop.

95
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,020
And it also is going to have
some potential energy still.

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,850
And where is that potential
energy coming from?

97
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,790
Well, it's going to come because
it's up in the air.

98
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,089
It's above the surface
of the loop-d-loop.

99
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,780
So it's going to have some
gravitational potential

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,450
energy, right?

101
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,370
So at this point, we're going
to have some kinetic energy.

102
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,460
We'll call that-- well, I'll
just call that kinetic energy

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,690
final-- because this is while
we care about alpha, maybe

104
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,410
here it might be the kinetic
energy final, but I'll just

105
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,240
define this as kinetic
energy final.

106
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,580
And then plus the potential
energy final.

107
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,480
And that of course, has to
add up to 10x squared.

108
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,510
And this, of course, now, this
was kind of called the spring

109
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,850
potential energy,
and now this is

110
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,080
gravitational potential energy.

111
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,780
So what's the energy
at this point?

112
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,660
Well, what's kinetic energy?

113
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,590
Kinetic energy final is going
to have to be 1/2 times the

114
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,200
mass times the velocity
squared, right?

115
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,690
And then what's the potential
energy at this point?

116
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,660
It's gravitational potential
energy, so it's the mass times

117
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,380
gravity times this height.

118
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,150
Right?

119
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,070
So I'll write that here.

120
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,250
Potential energy final is going
to be mass times gravity

121
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,940
times the height, which also
stands for Mass General

122
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,020
Hospital, anyway.

123
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,750
You can tell my wife's
a doctor, so my

124
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,130
brain just-- anyway.

125
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,360
So let's figure out the kinetic
energy at this point.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,320
So what does the velocity
have to be?

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,430
Well, we have to figure out
what the centripetal

128
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,580
acceleration is, and then, given
that, we can figure out

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,120
the velocity.

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,915
Because we know that the
centripetal acceleration-- and

131
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:55,730
I'll change colors for
variety-- centripetal

132
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,830
acceleration has to be the
velocity squared, over the

133
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,900
radius, right?

134
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,780
Or we could say-- and what is
the centripetal acceleration

135
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,490
at this point?

136
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,450
Well it's just the acceleration
of gravity, 9.8

137
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,410
meters per second squared.

138
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,750
So 9.8 meters per second
squared is equal to v

139
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,470
squared over r.

140
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,900
And what's the radius
of this loop-d-loop?

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,420
Well it's 1.

142
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,940
So v squared over r
is just going to

143
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,420
be equal to v squared.

144
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,110
So v squared equals 9.8-- we
could take the square root, or

145
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,740
we could just substitute the
9.8 straight into this

146
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,420
equation, right?

147
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:36,930
So the kinetic energy final is
going to be equal to 1/2 times

148
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:45,050
the mass times 4 times
v squared times 9.8.

149
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,770
And that equals-- let's just use
g for 9.8, because I think

150
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,110
that might keep it
interesting.

151
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,490
So this is just g, right?

152
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,340
So it's 2 times g.

153
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:03,610
So the kinetic energy final
is equal to 2g-- and g is

154
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,680
normally kilogram meters per
second squared, but now it's

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,600
energy, right?

156
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,360
So it's going to be in joules.

157
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,640
But it's 2g, right?

158
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,260
And what is the potential
energy at this point?

159
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,470
Well, it's the mass, which is
4, times g times the height,

160
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,490
which is 2.

161
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,290
So it's equal to 8g.

162
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,800
Right.

163
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,770
So what's the total energy
at this point?

164
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,080
The kinetic energy is 2g, the
potential energy is 8g, so the

165
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,730
total energy at this
point is 10g.

166
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,580
10g total energy.

167
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,950
So if the total energy at this
point is 10g, and we didn't

168
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,000
lose any energy to friction
and heat, and all of that.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
So then the total energy
at this point has also

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
got to equal 10g.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,530
And at this point we have no
kinetic energy, because this

172
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,400
block hasn't started
moving yet.

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,210
So all the energy is
a potential energy.

174
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,280
So this also has to equal 10g.

175
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,620
And this g, I keep saying,
is just 9.8.

176
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,750
I just wanted to do that just
so you see that it's a

177
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,140
multiple of 9.8, just for
you to think about.

178
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,900
So what do we have here?

179
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,110
[? I'll do ?]

180
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,060
these numbers worked out well.

181
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,410
So let's divide both
sides by 10.

182
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,730
You get x squared is equal
to g, which is 9.8.

183
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,560
So the x is going to be equal to
the square root of g, which

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,420
is going to be equal to what?

185
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,350
Let's see-- if I take 9.8, take
the square root of it,

186
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,360
it's like 3.13.

187
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,170
So x is 3.13.

188
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,049
So we just did a fairly-- what
seemed to be a difficult

189
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,179
problem, but it wasn't so bad.

190
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,500
We just said that, well the
energy in the beginning has to

191
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,340
be the energy at any point in
this, assuming that none of

192
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,340
the energy is lost to heat.

193
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,990
And so we just figured out
that if we compress this

194
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,540
spring, with the spring
constant of 10.

195
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,920
If we compress it 3.3 meters--
3.13 meters-- we will have

196
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,670
created enough potential
energy-- and in this case, the

197
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,730
potential energy is 10 times
9.8, so roughly 98 joules.

198
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,400
98 joules of potential energy
to carry this object all the

199
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,150
way with enough velocity at the
top of the loop-d-loop to

200
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,330
complete it, and then come
back down safely.

201
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,280
And so if we wanted to think
about it, what's the kinetic

202
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,140
energy at this point?

203
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,730
Well we figured out it
was 2 times g, so

204
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,120
it's like 19.6 joules.

205
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,020
Right.

206
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,590
And then at this point,
it is 98 joules.

207
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,950
Right?

208
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,000
Did I do that right?

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Well, anyway I'm running out
of time, so I hope I did do

210
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,150
that last part right.

211
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,130
But I'll see you in
the next video.
