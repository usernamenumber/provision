1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,740
Think about this real
world problem.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,660
To estimate the population of a
town in upcoming years, one

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,670
of the town workers collected
populations from past years

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,000
and made this table.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,210
So they have years starting
with 1950 and going up by

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,310
increments of 10 years.

8
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,130
And they just figure out the
population of the town in each

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,400
of those years.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,040
The town wants to estimate
the population for

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,950
2015, 2018, and 2020.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,930
To do this, will you be using
inductive reasoning or

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,510
deductive reasoning?

14
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,100
Now before answering that, let's
just think about what

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,850
inductive reasoning is and what
deductive reasoning is.

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,530
Inductive reasoning is looking
for a pattern or

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,940
looking for a trend.

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,220
So it's looking for a trend
or a pattern and then

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,510
generalizing.

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,640
You could imagine, it's kind
of extrapolating the

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,350
information you have,
generalizing.

22
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,470
Deductive reasoning is taking
some set of data or some set

23
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,170
of facts and using that to
come up with other, or

24
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,790
deducing some other, facts
that you know are true.

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,230
When you generalize you don't
know necessarily whether the

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,740
trend will continue, but
you assume it will.

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,850
You don't know 100%
it'll be true.

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,050
With deductive reasoning,
you know it'll be true.

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,300
You're starting with facts.

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,250
And then you're deducing other
facts from those facts.

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,200
Other facts that you
know are true.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,230
Now, when the town is
estimating, and that's kind of

33
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,570
a clue that they're not going
to know the exact population

34
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,990
for 2015, 2018, and 2020.

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,060
But when they estimate the
population for these years,

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,670
these years are in the future.

37
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,120
They don't know what
the population

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,370
will be in those years.

39
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,900
The best they can do is see
the trend of growth here,

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,050
maybe see what percentage it's
growing every 10 years.

41
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,720
Or what the absolute number of
growth is every 10 years.

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,730
And maybe they can continue
that trend out to

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,740
2015, 2018, and 2020.

44
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,320
So they'll be looking for trend
in growth over this

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,480
60-year period.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,360
And then they'll generalize
it out to these years.

47
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,470
So this will be inductive
reasoning.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,533
