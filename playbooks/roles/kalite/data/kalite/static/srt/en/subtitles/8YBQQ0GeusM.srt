1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,670
We're on problem 66.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,550
In the accompanying diagram,
the measure of

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,540
angle a is 32 degrees.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,770
And AC is equal to 10.

6
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,060
Which equation could be used
to find x in triangle ABC?

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,380
So we want x.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,960
So let's write our
SOHCAHTOA down.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,250
   

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,880
What are they giving us?

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,250
Well x is the opposite side,
this is equal to the opposite,

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,760
it's opposite of our
angle in question.

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,190
And then this 10 side
is the adjacent.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,150
So I haven't looked at the
choices yet, but if we say the

15
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:40,650
tangent of 32 degrees should be
equal to the opposite side,

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,670
which is x, over the adjacent
side, which is 10.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,870
And then if we multiply both
sides of this by 10, we get 10

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,580
tangent of 32 degrees
is equal to x.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,860
Let's hope that's one
of the choices.

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,410
Yep, sure enough, C.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,270
x is equal to 10 tangent
of 32 degrees.

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,200
Everything in trigonometry
really does

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,310
boil down to SOHCAHTOA.

24
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,350
You'll be amazed.

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,910
When you actually take
trigonometry as a class,

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,420
you'll see that they
have all these trig

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,350
identities and all that.

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,160
But all of those things can be
just proved from SOHCAHTOA.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,880
And these are just definitions
of ratios that have been very

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,280
useful in the world when
studying triangles.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,700
All right, 67.

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,010
But you can watch, we have a
whole playlist on trigonometry

33
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,610
and we talk about all the
ratios and the unit

34
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,320
circle and all that.

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,500
So if you're enjoying these
problems, I encourage you to

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,520
watch those videos.

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,455
Or if you don't understand these
problems, I encourage

38
00:01:38,455 --> 00:01:40,870
you even more to watch
those videos.

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,240
All right.

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,610
The diagram shows an 8 foot
ladder leaning against a wall.

41
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,800
The ladder makes a 53 degree
angle with the wall.

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,030
Which is closest to the distance
up the wall the

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,230
ladder reaches?

44
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,990
So this is what they
care about, this

45
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,810
distance right here.

46
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,430
So let's see how we
can figure it out.

47
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,270
If we write SOHCAHTOA, maybe
we don't have to

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,620
to write that anymore.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,460
So we have this angle and
what have they given us?

50
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,910
This deals with the hypotenuse,
which is 8.

51
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,535
And it deals with this
adjacent side.

52
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,290
   

53
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,630
So what trig function deals with
the adjacent side and the

54
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,020
hypotenuse.

55
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,820
Well, I'll write it down.

56
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,070
SOHCAHTOA.

57
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,660
   

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,050
We want to figure out adjacent,
we have the

59
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,540
hypotenuse.

60
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
What trig function
deals with it?

61
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,100
Well, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:42,870
So the cosine of 53 degrees is
equal to the adjacent side of

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,950
this triangle, of this
right triangle.

64
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,190
So that's A.

65
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,960
And you should only be applying
these, right now,

66
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,220
with right triangles.

67
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,610
Later on we'll learn, in
trigonometry how trig

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,640
functions are useful
for any triangle.

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Because obviously, only
a right triangle has a

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,050
hypotenuse.

71
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,330
So these h's wouldn't be too
meaningful if you're not

72
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,470
dealing with a right triangle.

73
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,380
Back to the problem.

74
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,520
Cosine of 53, it equals the
adjacent side over the

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,410
hypotenuse, which is 8.

76
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,960
I can write x there, x
is the adjacent side.

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,720
So we multiply both sides of
this by 8, we get 8 times the

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,460
cosine of 53 degrees
is equal to x.

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,960
And they give us
a little chart.

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,680
They tell us that the cosine of
53 degrees is approximately

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,240
equal to 0.6.

82
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,070
So we get 8 times 0.6
is equal to x.

83
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,770
8 times 0.6 is 4.8.

84
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,360
   

85
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,800
So x is equal to 4.8.

86
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,420
And that is choice B.

87
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,170
   

88
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,920
Problem 68.

89
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,640
Triangle JKL is shown below.

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Fair enough.

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,530
Which equation should be used
to find the length of JK?

92
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,560
This is JK.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,270
All right so we have
this angle here.

94
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,920
JK is the opposite side.

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,480
We want to figure out
the opposite side.

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,519
We have the hypotenuse.

97
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,920
So what trig function deals with
opposite and hypotenuse?

98
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
Well I could just
write SOH down.

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,970
I'm don't even have to write
the whole SOHCAHTOA.

100
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,210
Because sine is equal to the
opposite side over the

101
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,350
hypotenuse.

102
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:36,520
So in this case, sine of 24
degrees is equal to the

103
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,780
opposite side, which is side
JK, over the hypotenuse.

104
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,840
This is the hypotenuse
right here, 28.

105
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
The longest side of the right
triangle, or the side that's

106
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,800
opposite the 90 degree angle.

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
And so maybe we're done.

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:59,690
So sine of 24 degrees is
equal to JK over 28.

109
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,940
That's choice A.

110
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:08,380
   

111
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,070
Problem 69.

112
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,650
These are kind of fun,
aren't they?

113
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,710
What is the approximate height
in feet of the tree in the

114
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,260
figure below?

115
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,080
Now you'll see why trigonometry
is useful,

116
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,160
because I'm sure you often
wonder how tall is that tree?

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,050
And it might be hard
to climb it.

118
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,320
And now you can use
trigonometry.

119
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,440
If you just have a way to
measure the angle between your

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,350
line of sight and between you
and the top of the tree.

121
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,120
You've probably seen those
surveyors, actually they use

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,760
things like this.

123
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,090
And you can figure out the
heights of things far away if

124
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,630
you know how far away
you are from it.

125
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,070
But anyway, let's work
on this problem.

126
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,880
What is the approximate height
in feet of the tree in the

127
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,580
figure below?

128
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,990
OK, so this is 50.

129
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,580
So let's think about it.

130
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,780
What do they tell us?

131
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,460
This is 90, this is 50.

132
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,390
So the approximate
height in feet.

133
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,120
OK, so this is the opposite
side of this angle.

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,320
So let's call this h.

135
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,480
So what deals with the
opposite side?

136
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,125
Actually I should use h,
let's call that O.

137
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,450
O is the height of the
tree because it's

138
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,930
opposite the 50 angle.

139
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,870
So what deals with the opposite
and the hypotenuse?

140
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,580
So once again, SOHCAHTOA.

141
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,220
We just have to look
at the SOHA part.

142
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,870
Sine is equal to opposite
over hypotenuse.

143
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:36,790
So the sine of 50 degrees is
equal to the opposite side of

144
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,660
this triangle, that's the
height of the tree.

145
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,810
So I'll say O for the
height of the tree.

146
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,010
Over the hypotenuse, the
hypotenuse is 100 feet.

147
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,730
Multiply both sides by 100.

148
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:53,710
You get 100 sine of 50 is equal
to this opposite side,

149
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,430
which is equal to the
height of the tree.

150
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,830
Sine of 50 is 0.76.

151
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,360
So 0.76 times 100
is equal to O.

152
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,610
That 76 is equal to O, or
the height of the tree.

153
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,230
   

154
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh, they said 0.766.

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
So let's put another 6.

156
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,480
That becomes 76.6.

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,730
And that's choice B.

158
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,720
All right.

159
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Problem 70.

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,320
These go fast. If a is equal
to 3 roots of 3 in the

161
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,570
triangle below.

162
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,360
   

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,690
I think you're going to learn a
little bit about 30, 60, 90

164
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,140
triangles now.

165
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,695
What is the value of B?

166
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:41,250
   

167
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,600
OK, maybe they assume that you
already do know something

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,070
about 30, 60, 90 triangles.

169
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,330
But anyway, if a is equal
to 3 root 3, what is B?

170
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,830
And I'm debating on what
I should assume

171
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,130
that you already know.

172
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,530
But let's think about
it a little bit.

173
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,040
   

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,090
Let me see how I can do this
without resorting to just the

175
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,200
definition of 30, 60,
90 triangles.

176
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,350
I'll prove it for you.

177
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,940
Although, later you
can memorize.

178
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,360
Because when I keep saying 30,
60, 90 triangles, we know that

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,260
this right here is 60 degrees.

180
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,040
Because 30, plus 60, plus 90
is equal to 180 degrees.

181
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,090
So that's why we could
we keep calling this

182
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,510
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

183
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,280
So how do we figure out
this side, if we

184
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,310
just know that side?

185
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,830
And we know this
is 30 degrees.

186
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,840
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to try to redraw

187
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,620
this same triangle but I'm
going to flip it over.

188
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,799
And this is actually the proof
of figuring out the measures

189
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,950
of a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

190
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,330
So maybe I'll do it in
a different color.

191
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,420
And I have some time
so I'll do it.

192
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,840
Let's see.

193
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,520
So I'll do it like that.

194
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,840
I have to bring another line
down, something like that.

195
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,495
And then I'll have to draw
another line more like that.

196
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:02,590
I think you get the idea.

197
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,660
And then bring a line
across like that.

198
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,930
And actually, I'm going to draw
another line straight

199
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,360
down like that.

200
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
OK, let's see what we
can do with this.

201
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,660
Maybe there's an easier
way to do it.

202
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,400
But this is just what my brain
is thinking of right now.

203
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,140
Let's think about
it a little bit.

204
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,510
In this drawing that I've done,
this triangle is just a

205
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,590
mirror image of that one.

206
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,060
So this right here,
this is also 60.

207
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,990
This is 60, this is 60, what's
this angle going to be?

208
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,710
Well they're all collectively
supplements of each other.

209
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,030
If you go all the way
from there to there,

210
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,340
you have 180 degrees.

211
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,540
So this big angle right here
has got to be 60 degrees.

212
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,340
This angle right here, it's
a complement of 30.

213
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,140
So this is 60 degrees.

214
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,890
And then this is 60 degrees.

215
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,380
So this is an equilateral
triangle.

216
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,550
All the sides are going
to be equal.

217
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,690
So that side is equal to
that side, which is

218
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,650
equal to this side.

219
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,230
Now let me ask another
question.

220
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,650
What is this side right here?

221
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,630
Let me just draw the
shorter part.

222
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,050
And once you memorize 30, 60,
90 triangles, you don't have

223
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,180
to go through all this.

224
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,310
But it's good to be able
to reprove it.

225
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,460
So what's this length
right here?

226
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,190
Well if we look right up
there, that's length a.

227
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,750
This was just a mirror image,
so this is also length a.

228
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,860
This whole base of the
equilateral triangle is 2a.

229
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,700
Well it's an equilateral
triangle so all the sides are

230
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,330
the same, so this is
2a and this is 2a.

231
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,890
And just like that we were
able to figure out the

232
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,290
hypotenuse.

233
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,580
And they want to know
what the b is.

234
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,660
Once we know two sides of a
right triangle, it's very easy

235
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,230
to figure out the third side.

236
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,270
So we know that a squared
plus b squared

237
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,000
is equal to c squared.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,250
Let me write that down.

239
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,900
   

240
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,036
Now what's a squared?

241
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:58,670
   

242
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,510
a is 3 roots of 3.

243
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,680
So a squared would be, let me
write it down, 3 roots of 3

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,420
squared plus b squared is equal
to, let me do it in

245
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,670
another color.

246
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,320
What's c? c, we just figured
out, is 2 times a.

247
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,630
So it's 6 roots of 3 squared.

248
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,680
That's what we did all this
stuff for, to figure out that

249
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,370
this length is twice
that length.

250
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,500
Fair enough.

251
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,340
Now let's simplify.

252
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,990
So if we take 3 roots of 3 to
the second power, that's the

253
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,060
same thing as 3 squared times
square root of 3 squared.

254
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,450
So that's 9 times 3
plus b squared is

255
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,920
equal to 36 times 3.

256
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,820
And so that's 27
plus b squared.

257
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,030
36 times 3 is 108.

258
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,060
Subtract 27 from both sides.

259
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,300
b squared is equal to 81.

260
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,070
b is equal to 9.

261
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,160
So that is choice a.

262
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,550
Anyway, you should watch the
videos I've done in the

263
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,410
trigonometry playlist on 30, 60,
90 triangles if you want

264
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,570
to be able to do this faster.

265
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,440
But I think that was useful.

266
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,770
Because you've actually seem
how you can figure out the

267
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,130
sides of a 30, 60, 90 triangle
without having memorized it

268
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,810
ahead of time.

269
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,170
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

270
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,900
