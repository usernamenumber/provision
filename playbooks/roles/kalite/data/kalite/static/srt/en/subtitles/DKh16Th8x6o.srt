1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:05,317
We are asked to find the cube root of -512

2
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:08,615
Or another way to think about it is if I have some number

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:12,934
and it is equal to the cube root of -512

4
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:17,533
This just means if I take that number and I raise it to the to the third power

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:22,867
then I get -512. And if doesn't jump out at you immediately

6
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:29,667
what this is the cube of or what we have to raise to the third power to get -512

7
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:33,400
the best thing to do, is just to do a prime factorization of it.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,243
And before we do a prime factorization of it and to see which of these factors show up at least 3 times,

9
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:41,308
lets at least think about the negative part a little bit.

10
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,467
So negative 512 thats the same thing, so let me re-write the expression

11
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:51,664
this is the same thing as the cube root of negative 1 times 512.

12
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:54,822
Which is the same thing as the cube root,

13
00:00:54,822 --> 00:01:04,333
which is the same thing as the cube root of -1 times the cube root of 512

14
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,804
and this one is pretty straight forward to answer.

15
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,600
What number, when I raise it to the third power, do I get -1?

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,795
Well I get -1! This right here is -1

17
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:20,000
-1 to the third power is equal to -1 time-1 times -1, which is equal to -1

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
So the cube root of -1 is -1

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,133
So it becomes -1 times, times this business right here

20
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:33,400
Times the cube root, cube root of 512 and lets think of what this might be

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,782
So, so lets do the prime factorization

22
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:41,000
So 512 is 2 times 256

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,138
256 is 2 times 128

24
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:49,575
128 is 2 times 64

25
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:50,736
We already see a 2 three times

26
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:56,727
64 is 2 times 32

27
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:57,933
32 is 2 times 16

28
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,652
We're getting a lot of twos here

29
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:04,250
16 is 2 times 8

30
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,823
8 is 2 times 4

31
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:11,200
And 4 is 2 times 2

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,992
So we got a lot of twos

33
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,185
If you multiply

34
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:18,800
So essentially if you multiply two 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 times

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
You are going to get 512

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,012
Or 2 to the 9th power is 512

37
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,867
And that by itself should give you a clue of what the cube root is

38
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,610
But another way to think about it is

39
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,749
Can we find

40
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,139
There is definetly 3 twos here

41
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,786
But can we find 3 groups of 2

42
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,900
Or can we

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,867
We can also find

44
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,640
Look at it this way

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,800
We can find three groups of two 2s over here

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,724
So that's 2 times 2 is 4

47
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:44,699
2 times 2 is 4

48
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,600
So definitely 4 multiplied by itself 3 times is divisible into this

49
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,000
But even better it looks like we can get three groups of three twos

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,791
So one group, two groups and three groups

51
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,996
So each of these groups

52
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:05,400
2 times 2 times 2, that's 8

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,712
That is 8

54
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:08,244
And this is 2 times 2 times 2, thats eight

55
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,473
And this is also 2 times 2 times 2

56
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,402
So that's 8

57
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:14,932
So we could write 512 as being equal to

58
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:18,200
8 times 8 times 8

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,733
And so we can re-write this expression right over here

60
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,823
As the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8

61
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,200
And so this is equal to

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,074
this is equal to -1

63
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,653
Or I'll just put a negitave sign here

64
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:36,267
-1 times the cube root, the cube root of 8 times 8 times 8

65
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,734
So we are asking the question

66
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,400
What number can we multiply by itself 3 times

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,981
Or to the third power to get 512

68
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,000
Which is the same thing as 8 times 8 times 8

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,975
Well clearly this is 8

70
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,136
So the answer

71
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,458
This part right over here is just going to simplifly to eight

72
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,467
And so our answer to this

73
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:58,400
The cube root of -512 is -8

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,792
And we are done

75
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,139
And you can verify this

76
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,786
Multiply -8 times itself 3 times

77
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,133
Well lets just do it

78
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:08,988
-8 times -8 times -8

79
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,728
-8 times -8 is positive 64

80
00:04:11,728 --> 00:04:14,235
You multiply that times negative 8

81
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:18,000
You get -512
