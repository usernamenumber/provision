1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,910
Eugenol is the major components in oil of cloves.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,200
It has a molar mass of 164.2 grams per mole,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,440
and is 73.14% carbon, and 7.37% hydrogen.

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,140
The remainder is oxygen.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,610
What are the empirical and molecular formulas for eugenol?

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,840
And just as a refresher,

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,340
empirical formula is

8
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,070
the simplest ratio of the atoms in the molecule.

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,380
And we'll see that in a second.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,590
And the molecular formula

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,090
is the actual number of atoms in the molecule.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's see if we can figure this out.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,120
So the first piece of information they gave us is that,

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,150
the molar mass of eugenol is 164.2 grams per mole.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,130
So just to simplify things in our head,

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:55,880
let's just assume that we have 1 mole of eugenol.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,940
And just as a bit of a refresher,

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,470
a mole is just a huge number.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,810
It's like saying we have a million molecules of eugenol,

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,560
but a mole is just an even bigger number.

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,650
And we know that the molar mass of eugenol--

22
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,220
if we have that many molecules of eugenol,

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,080
then since we have 1 mole, we know that,

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,020
that is going to have a mass of 164.2 grams.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:26,240
So another way to say it is, we have 164.2 grams of eugenol.

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,960
Now they gave us the composition.

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,440
They tell us what percentage is carbon,

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,400
what's hydrogen, and the remainder is oxygen.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,860
So if we assume we have a mole of eugenol

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,600
and we know that mole will have a mass of 164.2 grams,

31
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,820
we can just use the percentages to figure out

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,930
what is our mass of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

33
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,880
So let's figure this out.

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,890
So let's start off with this.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:56,770
So 164.2 grams of eugenol times--

36
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,670
let me do it in another color-- times 73.14%.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,790
This will tell us what is our mass of carbon

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,690
that we're dealing with.

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,170
So let's figure this out.

40
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,350
So our mass of carbon--

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,050
get the calculator up here.

42
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,230
All right, so we have 164.2 times--

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,610
so 73.14% is the same thing as 0.7314.

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,870
So we have 120.1.

45
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,750
Let's go with that.

46
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,120
We have four significant digits in each of these numbers,

47
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,730
so let's just go with 120.1 grams of carbon.

48
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,320
So this is 120.1 grams of carbon.

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,750
Now let's do the same thing for the hydrogen and the oxygen.

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,000
So we have 164.2 grams of eugenol times--

51
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,290
what's our percent composition of hydrogen?

52
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,430
It's right here, 7.37%-- so times 7.37%.

53
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,130
What is this going to be equal to?

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,940
Get the calculator out.

55
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,950
So we have 164.2 times--

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,840
7.37% is 0.0737.

57
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,780
And we will get 12.1.

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,160
So we have 12.1 grams of carbon.

59
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,120
And they don't give us, explicitly,

60
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,270
the percent composition of oxygen.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,140
But we could figure it out fairly easily,

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,580
because we know everything left over is oxygen.

63
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,830
So we could take the mass of carbon,

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,070
the mass of hydrogen--

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,510
oh sorry, this isn't grams of carbon.

66
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,840
That's grams of hydrogen.

67
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,100
We could take the mass of hydrogen,

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,540
the mass of carbon, subtract them both from 164.2,

69
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,090
and whatever is left over will be oxygen.

70
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,180
So let's do it that way.

71
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,490
Or we could figure out the percentage that's oxygen,

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,460
because these all have to add up to 100%,

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,300
and then multiply.

74
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,870
Either way would work.

75
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,270
So let's do that.

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,740
So if we have 1 mole of eugenol,

77
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,270
it's 164.2 grams.

78
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,550
We just figured out that

79
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,470
120.1 of those grams are carbon,

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,000
and that 12.1 of those grams are hydrogen.

81
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,200
So what's left over?

82
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,250
We have exactly 32 grams of oxygen.

83
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,110
So what's left over

84
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,910
when you subtract these two guys out?

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,550
I'll do that in green.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
We are left with 32 grams of oxygen.

87
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,350
So if you have a mole of eugenol,

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,360
it has a mass of 164.2 grams.

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,670
And if you break it down

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,390
by the masses of the constituent molecules,

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,640
120 grams of carbon, 12 grams of hydrogen,

92
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,740
32 grams of oxygen.

93
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
Now what we need to do is

94
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,770
figure out how many moles of carbon this is,

95
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,610
how many moles of hydrogen this is,

96
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,240
and how many moles of oxygen.

97
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,750
And this is maybe something that

98
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,510
you should have memorized at some point,

99
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,610
because these are the three most common elements

100
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,830
you'll ever deal with.

101
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,540
But just as a refresher,

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,690
you could look up on any periodic table for carbon,

103
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,270
you would see in the periodic table the atom is--

104
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,560
well, most periodic tables

105
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,880
will give you the atomic weight,

106
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,020
which is the weighted average

107
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,130
of the different isotopes of carbon around.

108
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,270
But in general, the atomic weight,

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,930
or the weighted average of the atomic masses

110
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,360
of the different isotopes.

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,850
But carbon, you just remember that

112
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,900
the atomic weight is pretty close to

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,690
12 atomic mass units.

114
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,560
Which means, that carbon has

115
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,950
a molar mass of 12 grams per mole.

116
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,780
Or if you have a mole of carbon molecules,

117
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,840
it will have a mass of 12 grams.

118
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,980
We do the same thing for the hydrogen and the oxygen.

119
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:04,670
Hydrogen has, whether you take a single isotope

120
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,920
or you take the weighted average,

121
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,640
its atomic weight or mass,

122
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,050
depending which one you use,

123
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,340
is pretty darn close to 1.

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,870
And so hydrogen's molar mass is 1 gram per mole.

125
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,010
There's some decimals here

126
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,420
if you look it up on a periodic table,

127
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,850
but I just remember carbon as 12, hydrogen is 1,

128
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,600
and then finally, oxygen is 16.

129
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,350
So oxygen's is approximately 16 atomic mass units.

130
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,480
I guess, if you take a specific isotope, atomic mass.

131
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,400
If you take its weighted average, atomic weight.

132
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,380
And that means that

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,210
its molar mass is 16 grams per mole.

134
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,140
Now we have the number of grams

135
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,780
of oxygen, hydrogen, and oxygen.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,670
So now we should be able to

137
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,010
use this information down here

138
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,570
to figure out how many moles this is.

139
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,250
So let's do this.

140
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,650
So it's 12 grams per mole,

141
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,210
but we want to divide by grams

142
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,190
because we want this gram

143
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,690
to disappear in the numerator.

144
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,570
So what we could do is, if it's 12 grams per mole,

145
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:15,740
that's the same thing as 1 mole for every 12 grams.

146
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,750
All I did is, I took the reciprocal of this right here.

147
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,330
If we have 12 grams for every mole,

148
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,010
that's also true that

149
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,180
we have 1 mole for every 12 grams.

150
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,090
And the grams cancel out.

151
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,080
And we are left with 120.1 divided by 12,

152
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,690
which is pretty close to 10.

153
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:38,220
So this is equal to 10 moles of carbon.

154
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,120
So we know how many moles of carbon we have

155
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,610
in 1 mole of eugenol.

156
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,130
Now let's do the hydrogen.

157
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,290
So we do the multiplication here.

158
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,540
And so here we have 1 mole of hydrogen--

159
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,310
if we take the inverse of this,

160
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,400
or the reciprocal of this--

161
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,250
has a mass of 1 gram.

162
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,480
So really, this is just going to multiply out.

163
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,550
So we literally have,

164
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,270
we could say 12.1 moles of hydrogen.

165
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,770
But because we're looking for formulas,

166
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,940
that's pretty darn close to 12.

167
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,530
So we should just say 12 moles of hydrogen.

168
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,940
And then finally, we have our oxygen.

169
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,860
And we have 1 mole of oxygen for every 16 grams of oxygen.

170
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,670
32 divided by-- the grams cancel out, of course--

171
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,040
32 divided by 16 is 2.

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,200
So this is equal to 2 moles of oxygen.

173
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,380
So if we have 1 mole of eugenol,

174
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,620
we have 10 moles of carbon,

175
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,940
12 moles of hydrogen, and 2 moles of oxygen.

176
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,680
So we now have the ratio.

177
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,750
Or you could even think of,

178
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,740
if you had 1 molecule of eugenol,

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,700
we would have 10 carbons,

180
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,770
we have 12 hydrogens,

181
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,870
and we have 2 oxygens.

182
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,360
And we're done.

183
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,410
This is the molecular formula we have for every mole.

184
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,820
We could think of it in moles which is a huge number.

185
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,970
Or you could think of, for every molecule of eugenol,

186
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,450
we have 10 molecules of carbon,

187
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,800
12 molecules of hydrogen,

188
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,440
6 molecules of oxygen.

189
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:23,060
This right here is molecular formula.

190
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,290
And the empirical formula is essentially

191
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,240
taking this ratio to the simplest terms.

192
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,160
And all of these have a common factor of 2.

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:37,210
So the empirical formula,

194
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,550
we essentially just put this ratio in simplest terms.

195
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,080
So we can divide all of them by 2.

196
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,480
So let's divide all of them by 2.

197
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:48,780
And you have 5 carbons for every 6 hydrogens.

198
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,370
This isn't O, 6.

199
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,600
This is 2 oxygens.

200
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,470
So let me make that clear.

201
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,280
I'll have to erase a lot of stuff to get there.

202
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,230
There you go.

203
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,400
That was 2 oxygens.

204
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,480
Don't want to make that blunder.

205
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,850
We saw we have 2 moles of oxygen,

206
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,710
so this is the molecular formula.

207
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,860
And the empirical formula,

208
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,840
at least the 2 is still divisible by 2.

209
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,640
So you divide all of these by 2.

210
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,130
You get the simplest ratio.

211
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,990
For every 5 carbons, you have 6 hydrogens,

212
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,690
and you have 1 oxygen.

213
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,630
Or you can put a 1 right there if you like.

214
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,490
And we're done.
