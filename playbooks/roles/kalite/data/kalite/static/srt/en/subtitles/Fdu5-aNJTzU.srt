1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,680
It is not unusual in calculus
textbooks to see something-- to

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,780
see problems along the lines
of, prove that the limit as x

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,380
approaches-- I don't know,
say, as x approaches 1.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,240
Let me think of an interesting
function when x approaches 1.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,380
Let's see.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:27,770
3x times x minus 1
over x minus 1.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,980
And you might say, hey Sal, why
did you do this x minus 1 in

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,820
the numerator and denominator?

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,970
Well, I did that because
obviously you can't

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,020
have a 0 down here.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,270
So this function is actually
not defined as x is

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,030
equal to 1, right?

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,930
If I had just put a 3x,
this cancels out for

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,120
all the other values.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,250
So this is essentially the
line 3x, except it has a

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,970
hole at x is equal to 1.

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,580
And that's why I did it.

19
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,230
Because I want to take the
limit, and it's interesting to

20
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,070
take a limit a to a point where
the function doesn't exist.

21
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,200
But the books will say, hey,
prove that this limit is equal

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,650
to-- well, it would actually
be equal to 3, right?

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,440
Prove that.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,290
And you essentially have
to use the epsilon delta

25
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,910
definition of a limit.

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,390
So to prove this, you're
essentially proving

27
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,540
what this means.

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:11,720
And this means-- proving
this is the same thing as

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,690
proving-- so you could
just prove that given--.

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,190
So if you give me some epsilon
greater than 0-- and remember,

31
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,980
that's how close you want f
of x to get to the limit.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,880
Given some epsilon greater than
0, in order for this to be

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,970
true, I need to prove that I
can give you-- that there

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,650
exists-- that, you know, I can
give you a delta

35
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,400
greater than 0.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:49,006
Where as long as the distance
between x and our limit point,

37
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:54,090
x and 1, is less than delta--
remember, we don't want x to

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,320
ever get right on top
of the limit point.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,480
Because a function might
not be defined there.

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,020
So the distance between
x and 1 has to be

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,970
greater than 0, right?

42
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,390
That's what this tells us.

43
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,110
So I have to prove, you
give me an epsilon, that

44
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,850
I can give you a delta.

45
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,460
And as long as x is within
delta of 1-- and this is all

46
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,980
this is saying-- as long as
the distance between

47
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,780
x and 1, right?

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,320
That's when you subtract
2 things and take

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,910
the absolute value.

50
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,070
That's just distance.

51
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,050
So as long as the distance
between x and 1 is less than

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,770
delta then the distance between
3x-- let me write that up

53
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:37,650
there-- the distance between 3x
times x minus 1 over x minus 1,

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,470
that's the function, right?

55
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,550
The distance between that and
the limit point-- and 3--

56
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,260
is going to be less
than the epsilon.

57
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,110
   

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,390
A lot of calculus text
books, you know, they'll

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,070
write it generally.

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,620
They're like, the limit of f of
x as x approaches a of equals

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,030
l, and so this would be a.

62
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,410
This would be your f of
x, and this would be

63
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,090
your l, right there.

64
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,420
But anyway, when someone says
they want you to prove this,

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,020
they essentially want
you to prove this.

66
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,410
I'll give you an epsilon.

67
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,090
You have to prove that any
epsilon that you're given, or

68
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,860
that you give me, that I--
let's say I'm the one who has

69
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,360
to prove it-- any epsilon you
give me, I have to be able to

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,380
give you a delta where, as long
as x is within delta of 1,

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,000
then the function is within
epsilon of the limit point.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,550
And how do we do that?

73
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,140
And I'll just say, you know, a
lot of proofs, it's just kind

74
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,600
of-- there's not a-- well,
there's not a systematic

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,250
way to do proofs.

76
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,520
And that's kind of what
makes them so interesting

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,730
on a lot of levels.

78
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,060
But these, there kind of tends
to be a systematic way.

79
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,355
And this problem I've given
you, to some degree, is kind of

80
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:48,310
the easy one that they'll give
when they ask you

81
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,170
to prove these.

82
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,450
But they usually involve
starting from this point right

83
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,580
here and algebraically
manipulating it until you get--

84
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,680
until this expression
right here looks something

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,210
like this expression.

86
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,640
And then you'll have
this expression is less

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,560
than, you know, epsilon
divided by something.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,450
Or, you know, some
function of epsilon.

89
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,450
And it's like, oh, well as long
as delta is that, you give me

90
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,270
an epsilon, I can just apply
that, you know, take epsilon

91
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,660
and divide it by
4, or whatever.

92
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,150
And use that as my delta.

93
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,710
Then I've proved the theorem.

94
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,680
And so we'll do that here.

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,510
So let's start with this.

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,810
Let's start with kind of
where we want to get to.

97
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,380
And then figure out a delta
that's essentially a

98
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,290
function of epsilon.

99
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,440
So that whenever I'm given an
epsilon, I can say, hey,

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,380
whatever number you give me,
I'm going to give you back

101
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,500
a number that's, you know,
that divided by whatever.

102
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,060
And then this will all work.

103
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,840
So let's do that.

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,740
So immediately we
can simplify this.

105
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,750
We can cross these out.

106
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,720
And when you cross that out,
you still have to say, well, we

107
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,430
can't do that as long as x--
you can only do this as long as

108
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,200
you assume that x
does not equal 1.

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,340
Because if x equals 1, this
function is undefined, right?

110
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,860
And that's OK because we only
care about the intervals

111
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,610
as x approaches 1.

112
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,270
We only care about the
intervals as x approaches 1.

113
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,860
We don't care exactly
when x is equal to 1.

114
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,660
So that's fine.

115
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,480
So then this simplifies to--
this right there simplifies

116
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,550
to-- the absolute value of 3x
minus 3 is less than epsilon.

117
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,360
And then we could factor out a
3, so that's, you know, we

118
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,820
could say the absolute value of
3 times x minus 1 is

119
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,950
less than epsilon.

120
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,280
And you might already see, we
already have an x minus 1

121
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,200
there and an x minus 1 there.

122
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,000
If we can get this 3 over
on this side, then we'll

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,030
be done, essentially.

124
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,940
So the absolute value of 3
times some other number, it's

125
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,200
going to be the same thing as
the absolute value of 3 times

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240
the absolute value
of x minus 1.

127
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
And if you don't believe me,
I mean, try it out with

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,980
a bunch of numbers.

129
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,600
This is going to be
positive no matter what.

130
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
This is going to be
positive no matter what.

131
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,850
It's going to have the
same magnitude, right?

132
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,210
And of course, that is
less than epsilon.

133
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,600
And this is what we say-- you
know, a lot of times a calculus

134
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,950
teacher will say, if this is
true, this is true, if and

135
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,370
only if this is true.

136
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,830
And that's just a
fancy way of saying.

137
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,940
So sometimes they'll
do a two way arrow.

138
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,550
Sometimes they'll write IF
and only IF, kind of an IFF.

139
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,260
An IF with 2 f's.

140
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,940
But that just means if
that's true, that's true.

141
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,570
And if this is true,
then that's true.

142
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,380
And that's generally the case,
whenever you just do some

143
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,510
algebraic manipulation.

144
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,450
You can manipulate this back to
get that, or that to get that.

145
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,770
And then they'll say, well, if
this is true, this is true

146
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,370
if and only if this is true.

147
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,020
But this is just
algebraic manipulation.

148
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,220
Right?

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,490
Because you can go back and
forth between these steps.

150
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,720
And that's true, if and
only if that is true.

151
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,980
And then the absolute value
of 3 is just 3, right?

152
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
We know that.

153
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,180
Let's divide both sides by 3
and you get-- well, I can

154
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,920
just get rid of the absolute
value signs right there.

155
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,725
Because we know that's 3.

156
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,760
If you divide both sides of the
equation by 3, you get the

157
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,680
absolute value of x minus 1
is less than epsilon over 3.

158
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,120
So what have we
just done so far?

159
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,455
We've just proved that the
absolute value-- I need to

160
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:00,710
write this in another color.

161
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,930
We've just proved that the
absolute value of essentially

162
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:14,270
3x times x minus 1 over x minus
1 minus 3 is less than epsilon,

163
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:22,620
if and only if x minus 1 is
less than epsilon over 3.

164
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,390
Right?

165
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:29,570
So it's like, this is true, as
long as the distance between x

166
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,890
and 1 is less than
epsilon over 3.

167
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,080
So we can just use epsilon
over 3 as our delta.

168
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,100
Remember the whole point of
this was like, you give me

169
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,645
an epsilon, you give me a
distance, or you say, I want

170
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:46,110
to be within this distance
of my limit point.

171
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,480
I want the function to be that
close to the limit point.

172
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,100
And this is just the distance
between the function and

173
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,240
the limit point, right?

174
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,150
This is f of x.

175
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,150
And this is the limit
that it approaches.

176
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,360
So you want to be that close.

177
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,680
And I say, well, you're going
to be that close if and only if

178
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,600
x-- the distance between x and
1, or the distance between x

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,320
and the value it's
approaching-- is

180
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,750
less than this.

181
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,630
So we just prove
this algebraically.

182
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,890
So whatever number you give
me-- if you give me a-- if

183
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,490
you say, Sal, I want to be
within 1 of the limit point.

184
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,110
I want f of x to be no further
than 1 from the limit point,

185
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,850
then I'll say, OK, and
I'll give you 1/3, right?

186
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,780
Because this is true.

187
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,580
Let me write that out.

188
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,460
So let's say you pick
1 as an epsilon.

189
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,597
So you say, hey, you need to
prove to me that there's some x

190
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:43,080
value where, as long as the x
value is no more-- there's

191
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,130
some value of delta.

192
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,080
So as long as we're no more
than delta away from 1, then

193
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,210
the function itself will
be no more than 1 away

194
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,570
from the limit value.

195
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,590
Right?

196
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,660
And then I say, well,
you, gave me an epsilon

197
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,310
that's equal to 1.

198
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,140
So I could just make-- I can
just say this is, you know, we

199
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,860
just proved, if and only if
absolute value of x minus 1 is

200
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,120
less than whatever number
you gave me divided by 3.

201
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,790
And that actually makes
a lot of sense if you

202
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,900
graph this equation.

203
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,990
Let me see.

204
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,100
Let me draw the x-axis, y-axis.

205
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,710
We already established.

206
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,470
This thing looks just like the
equation of 3x except it has

207
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,490
a hole at x is equal to 1.

208
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,840
Let me draw the graph.

209
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,530
It'll have slope.

210
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,700
It'll have the slope of 3.

211
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,790
So it'll be pretty steep.

212
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,410
It'll look something like that.

213
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,940
And when we're at 1--
this point right

214
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,200
here-- there's a hole.

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,420
Right?

216
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,620
This is 3.

217
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,880
So all we're saying, we just
proved that-- so if you said

218
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,930
that you wanted to be within 1
of our limit point, that's like

219
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,970
you giving me an epsilon of 1.

220
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,710
So this distance
right here is 1.

221
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,090
   

222
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,780
Which would be a
pretty big number.

223
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,970
So you want the function
to be within 1 of our

224
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,980
limit point, right?

225
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,240
Because this is
the limit point.

226
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,510
Then all we're saying is, you
just have to take 1/3 of that.

227
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,520
So we just have to be within
1/3-- so this distance right

228
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,570
here is 1/3 away from 1.

229
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,030
Or we could have said it more
generally, this is epsilon.

230
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,180
This is epsilon.

231
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,220
This would be epsilon over 3.

232
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,810
This is epsilon over 3.

233
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,090
And the reason why this is a
proof, is because it shows no

234
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,670
matter what epsilon you give
me, I can always find a delta.

235
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,410
Because I can just take
whatever number you gave

236
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,410
me, and divide it by 3.

237
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,160
And I can divide any real
number greater than 0.

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,690
I can divide any
real number by 3.

239
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,970
So I can always-- no matter
what you give me-- I can always

240
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,840
find you something else.

241
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,640
And therefore, I have proven by
the epsilon delta definition of

242
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,350
limits that the limit
as x approaches 1, of

243
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,890
this, is equal to 3.

244
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,500
