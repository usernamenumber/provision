1
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:15,181
It's the longest side of the triangle; it's opposite the 90 degree side, it's oppisite the right angle.

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,771
And a, length a, this is the length of the adjacent side of this angle right over here.

3
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:53,437
So, what trig function deals with adjacent and the hypotenuse?

4
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,033
Well remember, let's rewrite soh cah toa.

5
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:54,780
soa cah toa.

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,328
Well cosine deals with adjacent and hypotenuse.

7
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:55,834
Cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

8
00:00:56,334 --> 00:05:12,002
So we can right that cosine of 60 degrees is equal to the adjacent side - the length of the adjacent side - which is a, over the hypotenouse, which is equal to 10.

9
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,071
If we want to solve for a, we can just multiply both sides by 10.

10
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:13,638
And we're left with a is equal to 10 time the cosine of 60 degrees.

11
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:14,063
Now if you were to type cosine of 60 degrees into your calculator, you would get this big decimal number,

12
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:14,243
but cosine of 60 degrees is one that comes up a lot.

13
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:14,436
It is actually good to know the sine and cosine of 60 degrees, 30 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees because they come up so much

14
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:14,837
and often times you might want to express your answer, not as a decimal, but as some type of radical expression.

15
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:15,046
So it's good to know that the cosine of 60 degrees is one half.

16
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:15,223
And I guess, for the case of 60 degrees - cosine of 60 degrees - your calculator would have done the job.

17
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:15,442
and given you a vey exact answer. We can show that to you.

18
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:15,634
If we say cosine of 60 degrees, you get exactly one half.

19
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:15,798
Now this is one...I normally don't tell people to commit a lot of thigs to memory, but this is a useful one to commit to memory.

20
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:15,903
The cosine of 60 degrees is equal to one half.

21
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,164
So if the cosign of 60 degrees is one half, which is equal to 5.

22
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:16,302
So, a is equal to 5.
