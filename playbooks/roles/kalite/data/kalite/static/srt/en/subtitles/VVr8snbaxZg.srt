1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,440
So in the last video I
hopefully proved to you, at

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,720
least maybe it doesn't make
intuitive sense just yet, but I

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,130
showed you that the probability
of a and b is equal to the

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,400
probability of a given b
times the probability of b.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,700
And the probability of b given
a is equal to the probability

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,250
of b given a times a.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,230
And then we played around a
little bit and we got this.

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,550
And this is called Bayes'
theorem or Bayes' law.

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,630
And I will now show you how
you can apply this formula.

11
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,450
But it shouldn't
be in a formula.

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,690
You should always be able to
intuitively come to this

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,270
conclusion, even if you forget
Bayes' theorem, which I do all

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,740
the time and then I go through
that thought process that

15
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,050
we did at the end of the
last video over again.

16
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,870
But let's see how we can
apply this to this problem.

17
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,250
So we want to figure out the
probability that we pick the

18
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,250
two-sided coin given that we
observed when we flip it

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,670
five times we got 5 heads.

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,920
So let's say that this is
event a and this is event b.

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,720
So we can use Bayes' theorem.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,770
So the probability that I got
the two-sided coin, given 5 out

23
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:07,440
of 5 heads is equal to the
probability-- and I'm actually

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,930
going to think about what this
fraction means in a second.

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,370
But it means the probability
that I got a given

26
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,660
b, so it's this.

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,760
The probability that I got 5
out of 5 heads, given the

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,810
two-sided coin times the
probability of the two-sided

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,150
coin-- b-- we defined event
b as the two-sided coin.

30
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,830
Time the probability
of two-sided coin.

31
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,870
Divided by the probability of
in general, the probability

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,080
of getting 5 out of 5 heads.

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,610
   

34
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,080
Well, what's the probability
of getting 5 out of 5 heads

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,600
given the two-sided coin?

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,680
Well, we wrote that down.

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,580
We're guaranteed to get 5 out
of 5 heads, so that's 1.

38
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,470
And what's the probability of
getting the two-sided coin?

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,840
Well, that was 1/10.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,140
And now what's the probability
of getting 5 out of

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,110
5 heads in general.

42
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,660
Well, we figure that out, I
think, either in the last video

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,720
or the video before that.

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,170
I forgot the exact number.

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,800
Actually, it was something
like 1/10 plus 9/320.

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,910
Right, so this is 32.

47
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,450
It was 41/320.

48
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,760
We figured that out in
the previous problem.

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,200
This is over 41 over 320.

50
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,150
And so what did we get?

51
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:38,190
We get this is equal
to 1/10 over 41/320.

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,360
Now what is that equal to?

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,670
That equals to 1/10
times 320/41.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,480
Let's divide the top
and the bottom by 10.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,510
So it equals 32/41.

56
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,610
That's interesting.

57
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,560
I actually find that
really interesting.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,150
I don't know which coin I
picked out of the bag, but I

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,150
know that if I flip that coin
five times and all 5 are heads,

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,360
there's a 32 out of 41 chance--
this is maybe a little bit

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,880
better than a 75% chance that I
picked the two-headed

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,330
coin we could say.

63
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,490
And let's think about this
visually a little bit.

64
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,120
So if this is the entire
universe of what could happen,

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,830
and we said, 1/10 of that--
this is the two-sided coin,

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,720
this is the fair coin.

67
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,530
And then, out of all of that,
the situation in which we get 5

68
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,350
out of 5, well, those could
be-- if we got the two-sided

69
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,820
coin all of that is
going to be 5 out of 5.

70
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,120
And then some small fraction,
1/32 of the fare coin.

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,070
So this yellow circle
represents getting

72
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,310
5 heads in a row.

73
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,860
So if I want to know what's the
probability of the two-sided

74
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,420
coin, all Bayes' theorem is
saying, well, OK, we observed

75
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,490
that we got the two-sided coin.

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,540
Sorry, we observed that
we got 5 out of 5 heads.

77
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,980
So we now know that we're in
this yellow universe because

78
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,470
the yellow universe represents
the area or all of the outcomes

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,180
where we got 5 out of 5 heads.

80
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,040
And then we say, well, out of
those outcomes, what percentage

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,670
of them involved me getting
the two-sided coin?

82
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,010
Well, if we look here,
all of these-- sorry.

83
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,560
Edit.

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,640
If we look at it here, this is
the area out of the yellow

85
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,770
where I had the two-sided coin
and I got the 5 out of 5.

86
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,300
And so this is going to
be roughly 32 out of 41

87
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,320
of this yellow area.

88
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,840
So that's a visual
representation of

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,000
Bayes' theorem.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,810
This says the probability of
getting a two-sided coin,

91
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,560
given I got 5 out of 5,
that says-- well, OK.

92
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,660
Let's look at the universe of
you got 5 out of 5, and then,

93
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,950
what percentage of that
universe involved you getting,

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,370
essentially the two-sided coin?

95
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,250
And that's that.

96
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,710
And that's all Bayes' theorem
essentially tells us.

97
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,260
So let's see if we
can apply that.

98
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,770
   

99
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,690
Let's do a more
interesting one.

100
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,090
Actually, I'm going to to leave
it there and then in the

101
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,120
next video I will apply
Bayes' theorem to more

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,025
interesting problems.

103
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,740
See you soon.

104
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,400
