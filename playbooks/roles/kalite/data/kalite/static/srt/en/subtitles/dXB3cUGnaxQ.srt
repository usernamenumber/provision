1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,933
In this video we will talk about what the chi squared distribution is. Chi squared distribution

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:20,067
sometimes called the chi-squared distribution. And in the next few videos, we will actually use it to test how well

3
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,933
theoretical distributions explain observed ones, or, how good a fit

4
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:28,800
observed results are for theoretical distributions. So lets just think about it a little bit, lets say

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,600
I have some random variables. And each of them are independent standard

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,600
normally distributed random variables. let me just remind you what that means, so lets just say I have

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
I have the random variable X. If X is normally distributed

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,467
we could write that X is a normal random variable with a mean

9
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:57,600
of 0 and a variance of 1 or you can say that the mean expected value of X is equal to 0

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,000
or in that the variance of our random variable X is equal to 1. Or, just to visualize it

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,067
is that we are sampling when we take an instantiation of this variable

12
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:14,333
we are sampling from a normal distribution a standardized normal

13
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:21,400
distribution that looks like this. Mean of 0 and then a variance of 1 which would also mean the standard

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,067
deviation of 1.

15
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:30,000
So this could be the standard deviation, or , variance, or the standard deviation that would be equal to 1

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,467
so a chi-squared distribution, if you just take one of these random variables

17
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:38,333
and you, let me just define it this way, let me take a new random variable

18
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:47,800
let me define a new random variable Q, let me define a new random variable Q that is equal to you essentially sampling

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,800
from this standard normal distribution and squaring whatever number you got.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,533
so it is equal to this random variable X squared, it is equal to that random variable X squared

21
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:09,067
the dist for this random variable right here is going to be an example

22
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:13,067
of the chi-squared distribution, actually what we are going to see in this video is that the

23
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:19,400
chi-squared distribution is actually a set of distributions depending on how many sums you have

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,133
right now we only have 1 random variable that we are squaring so this is just one of the examples

25
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:36,000
that we will talk more about them in a second. This right here, this we could write that Q is a chi-squared distributed random variable

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,133
or that we could use this notation right here Q is, we could write it like this

27
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:46,133
this isn't an X anymore this is the greek letter chi although it looks alot like a curvy X

28
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:52,133
so its a member of chi-squared and since we are only taking one sum over here

29
00:02:52,133 --> 00:03:00,533
here, we are only taking the sum of on 1 independent normally distributed standard normally distributed variable we say

30
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:04,067
that this has only 1 degree of freedom. and we write that over here

31
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:10,267
so this right here is our is our degree of freedom

32
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:14,630
we have one degree of freedom over there. now if we define

33
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:24,667
lets call this Q1, let's say we have another random variable - lets call it Q - we need a diff color, let me do Q2 in blue

34
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:34,667
lets say I have another random variable Q2 that is defined as, lets say I have 1 independent normally distributed variable I'll call that

35
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:45,333
X1 and then I'll square it. and then I have another independent standard or is guess you could call it standard normal

36
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:51,800
distributed variable X2 and then I square it. And you could imagine that both of these guys have distributions like

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:59,733
this and they are both independent and so to get to sample Q2 you essentially sample X1 from this distribution square that value,

38
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:08,667
sample X2 from the same distribution essentially square that value then add the two and then you are going to get Q2

39
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:21,400
this over here, here we would write Q1. Q2 here we would write is a chi-square distributed random variable with 2 degrees of freedom.

40
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:32,933
Two degrees of freedom and just to visualize the set of chi-squared distributions

41
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:39,667
lets look at this over here. So this, I got this off of wikipedia, this shows us some of the probability densities

42
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:45,933
functions for some of the chi-squared distributions. This first one over here for K of equal 1

43
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:51,800
that's the degrees of freedom so this essssentually our Q1. This is our probability density

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:01,533
function for Q1 and notice it really spikes close to 0 and that makes sense. If you were sampling just once from this standard norm dist

45
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:07,200
there's a very high likelyhood that your going to get something pretty close to 0

46
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
and then if you square something close to 0, remember these are decimals

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,267
they are going to be less than 1 pretty close to 0 its going to become even smaller

48
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:19,000
so you have a high prob of getting a very small value you have a high prob of getting

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,200
values less than some threshold, this right here less than is guess this is 1 right here

50
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,467
so then one half and then you have a very low prob of getting a large number. To get

51
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:37,200
a 4 you would have to sample a 2, you would have to sample a 2 from this distribution and we know that 2 is

52
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,333
actually its 2 variences or two standard deviations from the mean, so its less likely

53
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:51,533
and acutally thats - thats to get a 4 so to get an even larger numbers its going to be even less likely

54
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,533
so thats why you see this shape over here. now when you have 2

55
00:05:53,533 --> 00:06:00,933
degrees of freedom it moderates a little bit this is the shape for, this blue line right here is the

56
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:06,267
shape of Q2 and notice that your are a little bit less likely to get values close to 0

57
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,600
and a little bit more liekly to get numbers further out

58
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,267
but its still kinds shifted of weightrd towards small numbers

59
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:20,267
then if we had another random variable and other chi-squared distributed random variable so then we have

60
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:29,800
lets say Q3 and lets deffing it as sum f three indipenedient variables

61
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,733
each of them would have a stand norm dist so X1, X squared plus X3 squared then all the sudden

62
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:46,067
our Q3, this is Q2 here, has a chi-squared distribution of 3 degrees of freedom so this guy right over here

63
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,867
that will be this green line. Maybe I should have done this

64
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:54,600
in green, this will be this green line over here and then notice that it is becoming a little more likely

65
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,267
that you get values in this range over here.

66
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:00,400
because you are taking the sum, each of these are going to be pretty small values, but you are taking the

67
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,933
sum so it starts to shift it over to the right. So the more degrees of freedom you have

68
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,933
the further this lump starts to move to the right. and to some degree

69
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:11,267
the more symmetric it gets and whats interesting about this

70
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:14,267
i guess its almost different than any other distribution,

71
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,600
we have looked at, although we have looked at others that have

72
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
this property as well, is that you cant have a value below 0

73
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,933
because we are always squaring these values each

74
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:27,000
these guys can have values below zero, they are normally distributed, they can have negative values

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
but since we are squaring and taking the sum of squares

76
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,067
this is always going to be positive.

77
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,333
The place that this is going to be useful, and we are going to see in the next

78
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:38,733
few videos is in measuring, essentially error from an expected value

79
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:44,708
and if you take the total error, you can figure out the probability of getting that error

80
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:49,533
from, if you hold some parameters, or if you assume some parameters

81
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,000
we'll talk more about that in the next video

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,067
Now with that said, I just want to show you how to read

83
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:59,800
a chi-squared distribution table. So if I were to ask you, if I were to ask you

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,467
if this is our distribution, let me pick this blue one right here

85
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:07,400
so over here we have 2 degrees of freedom for adding two of these guys right here

86
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,933
if i were to ask you, what is the probability

87
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:14,333
what is the probability, of, what is the probability of

88
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:21,462
Q2 being greater than, Q2 being greater than. Let me

89
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:26,390
put it this way. What is the probability of Q2 being greater than

90
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,733
2.41? And I'm picking that value for a reason.

91
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:35,200
so I want the probability of Q2 being greater than 2.41

92
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,800
what I want to do is, ill look at a, ill look at a chi-squared table

93
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,533
like this. Q2 is a version of chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom

94
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:49,267
so i look at this row right here under 2 degrees of freedom

95
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:53,800
and I want the probability of getting a value

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,133
above 2.41 and i picked 2.41 because it is actually

97
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,600
at this table. And so most of these chi-squared

98
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
the reason why we have these weird numbers

99
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,933
like this instead of whole numbers

100
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,800
or easy to read fractions is its actually

101
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,467
driven by the p value its driven by the probability

102
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:09,933
of getting something larger than that value

103
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:11,733
so normally you would look at it the other way

104
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:15,600
you would say, ok if i want to say what, what chi-squared value

105
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,533
for 2 degrees of freedom there's a 30% chance of getting

106
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,600
something larger than that, then i would look up 2.41

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,667
buyt im doing it the other way just for the sake of this video

108
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,333
so if i want the probability of getting, of this random variable right here

109
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,533
being greater thaan 2.41, of being greater than 2.41 or its p value

110
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:37,533
we read it right here, it is 30% and just to visualize it on this chart

111
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:41,467
this chi-squared distribution, this Q2 the blue one

112
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:44,267
over here 2.41 is going to sit, lets see this is three

113
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:48,933
this is 2.5 so 2.41 is going to be someplace right around

114
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,933
here, so essentially what that table is telling us

115
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:58,333
is this entire area, this entire area, under, under this blue

116
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,800
line right here. what is that? and that right there is going

117
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,933
to be 30% of, well its going to be .3, or you can view

118
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:11,533
it as 30% of the entire area under this curve

119
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:15,600
because obviously all the probabilites have to add up to 1.

120
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
so that's our intro to chi-squared distribution. In the next video we are

121
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,933
actually going to use it to make some, or to test some

122
00:10:20,933 --> 99:59:59,999
inferences
