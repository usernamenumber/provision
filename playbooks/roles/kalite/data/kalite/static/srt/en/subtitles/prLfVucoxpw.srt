1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,920
In this video, we're going to
study the electric field

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,860
created by an infinite uniformly
charged plate.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,400
And why are we going
to do that?

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,550
Well, one, because we'll learn
that the electric field is

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,650
constant, which is neat by
itself, and then that's kind

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,420
of an important thing to realize
later when we talk

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,640
about parallel charged plates
and capacitors, because our

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,510
physics book tells them that
the field is constant, but

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,340
they never really prove it.

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,340
So we will prove it here, and
the basis of all of that is to

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,790
figure out what the electric
charge of an infinitely

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,400
charged plate is.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,975
So let's take a side view of the
infinitely charged plate

15
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:37,440
and get some intuition.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,550
Let's say that's the side view
of the plate-- and let's say

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,670
that this plate has a charge
density of sigma.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,670
And what's charge density?

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,240
It just says, well, that's
coulombs per area.

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,750
Charge density is equal
to charge per area.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,930
That's all sigma is.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,980
So we're saying this has a
uniform charge density.

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,030
So before we break into what may
be hard-core mathematics,

24
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,870
and if you're watching this in
the calculus playlist, you

25
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,670
might want to review some of
the electrostatics from the

26
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,400
physics playlist, and
that'll probably be

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,810
relatively easy for you.

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,090
If you're watching this from the
physics playlist and you

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,020
haven't done the calculus
playlist, you should not watch

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,430
this video because you will
find it overwhelming.

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,710
But anyway, let's proceed.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,200
So let's say that once again
this is my infinite so it goes

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,300
off in every direction and it
even comes out of the video,

34
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,170
where this is a side view.

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,130
Let's say I have a point
charge up here Q.

36
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,655
   

37
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:41,470
So let's think a little bit
about if I have a point--

38
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,170
let's say I have an area
here on my plate.

39
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,550
Let's think a little bit about
what the net effect of it is

40
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,250
going to be on this
point charge.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,430
Well, first of all, let's say
that this point charge is at a

42
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,225
height h above the field.

43
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:58,840
Let me draw that.

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,260
This is a height h, and let's
say this is the point directly

45
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,300
below the point charge, and
let's say that this distance

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,110
right here is r.

47
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,400
So first of all, what is the
distance between this part of

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
our plate and our
point charge?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,780
What is this distance that
I'll draw in magenta?

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,030
What is this distance?

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,400
   

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,550
Well, the Pythagorean theorem.

53
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,880
This is a right triangle, so
it's the square root of this

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,270
side squared plus this
side squared.

55
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,030
So this is going to be
the square root of h

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,570
squared plus r squared.

57
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,990
So that's the distance between
this area and our test charge.

58
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,550
Now, let's get a little
bit of intuition.

59
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,410
So if this is a positive test
charge and if this plate is

60
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,950
positively charged, the force
from just this area on the

61
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,620
charge is going to be radially
outward from this area, so

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,220
it's going to be-- let me do it
in another color because I

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,220
don't want to-- it's going to
go in that direction, right?

64
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,720
But since this is an infinite
plate in every direction,

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,530
there's going to be another
point on this plate that's

66
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,610
essentially on the other side of
this point over here where

67
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,140
its net force, its net
electrostatic force on the

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,490
point charge, is going
to be like that.

69
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,680
And as you can see, since we
have a uniform charge density

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,470
and the plate is symmetric in
every direction, the x or the

71
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,700
horizontal components of the
force are going to cancel out.

72
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,080
And so that's true for really
any point along this plate.

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,910
Because if you pick any point
along it, and we're looking at

74
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,720
a side view, but if we took a
top view, if that's the top

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,790
view and, of course, the plate
goes off in every direction

76
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,390
forever and that's kind of where
our point charge is, if

77
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,930
we said, oh, well, you know,
there's this point on the

78
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,160
plate and it's going to have
some y-component that's on

79
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,160
this top view coming out of the
video, but it'll have some

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,190
x-component, this point's
x-component effect

81
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,320
will cancel it out.

82
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,000
You can always find another
point on the plate that's

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,680
symmetrically opposite whose
x-component of electrostatic

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,600
force will cancel out
with the first one.

85
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,769
So given that, that's just a
long-winded way of saying that

86
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,900
the net force on this point
charge will only be upwards.

87
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,025
I think it should make sense
to you that all of the

88
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,370
x-components or the horizontal
components of the

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,120
electrostatic force all cancel
out, because they're infinite

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,780
points to either side
of this test charge.

91
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,550
So with that out of the way,
what do we need to focus on?

92
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,890
Well, we just need to focus
on the y-components of the

93
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,470
electrostatic force.

94
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,660
So what's the y-component?

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,460
So let's say that this point
right here-- and I'll keep

96
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,270
switching colors.

97
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,270
Let's say that this point-- and
once again, this is a side

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:09,250
view-- is exerting-- its field
at that point is e1, and it's

99
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,270
going to be going in
that direction.

100
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,620
What is its y-component?

101
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,200
What is the component
in that direction?

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,620
And, of course, it's
pushing outwards if

103
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,290
they're both positive.

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,120
So what is the y-component?

105
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,290
What is that?

106
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,330
Well, if we knew theta, if
we knew this angle, the

107
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,350
y-component, or the upwards
component is going to be the

108
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,890
electric field times
cosine of theta.

109
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,590
Cosine is adjacent over
hypotenuse, so hypotenuse

110
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,810
times cosine of theta is
equal to the adjacent.

111
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,050
So if we wanted the vertical
or the y-component of the

112
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,800
electric field, we would just
multiply the magnitude of the

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,290
electric field times the
cosine of theta.

114
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,980
So how do we figure out theta?

115
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,510
Well, that theta is also the
same as this theta from our

116
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,430
basic trigonometry.

117
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,080
And so what's cosine of theta?

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,940
Cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse

119
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,770
from SOHCAHTOA, right?

120
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,160
Cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

121
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,190
   

122
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,120
So when we're looking at this
angle, which is the same as

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,110
that one, what's adjacent
over hypotenuse?

124
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,740
This is adjacent, that
is the hypotenuse.

125
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,600
So what do we get?

126
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,030
We get that the y-component of
the electric field due to just

127
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:29,065
this little chunk of our plate,
the electric field in

128
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:33,935
the y-component, let's just call
that sub 1 because this

129
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,280
is just a little small
part of the plate.

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,400
It is equal to the electric
field generally, the magnitude

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,720
of the electric field from this
point, times cosine of

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,910
theta, which equals the electric
field times the

133
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,500
adjacent-- times height-- over
the hypotenuse-- over the

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,110
square root of h squared
plus r squared.

135
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,610
Fair enough.

136
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,250
So now let's see if we can
figure out what the magnitude

137
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,270
of the electric field is, and
then we can put it back into

138
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,920
this and we'll figure out the
y-component from this point.

139
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,770
And actually, we're not just
going to figure out the

140
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,840
electric field just from that
point, we're going to figure

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,730
out the electric field from a
ring that's surrounding this.

142
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,530
So let me give you a little bit
of perspective or draw it

143
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,480
with a little bit
of perspective.

144
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,990
So this is my infinite
plate again.

145
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,920
I'll draw it in yellow
again since I

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,390
originally drew it in yellow.

147
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,315
This is my infinite plate.

148
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:39,675
It goes in every direction.

149
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:45,240
   

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,930
And then I have my charge
floating above this plate

151
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,930
someplace at height of h.

152
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,120
And this point here, this could
have been right here

153
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,770
maybe, but what I'm going to do
is I'm going to draw a ring

154
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,470
that's of an equal radius around
this point right here.

155
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,430
So this is r.

156
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,850
Let's draw a ring, because all
of these points are going to

157
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,400
be the same distance from
our test charge, right?

158
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,170
They all are exactly like this
one point that I drew here.

159
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,420
You could almost view this as
a cross-section of this ring

160
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,290
that I'm drawing.

161
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,890
So let's figure out what the
y-component of the electric

162
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,310
force from this ring is
on our point charge.

163
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,370
So to do that, we just have to
figure out the area of this

164
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:34,740
ring, multiply it times our
charge density, and we'll have

165
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,640
the total charge from that
ring, and then we can use

166
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,919
Coulomb's Law to figure out its
force or the field at that

167
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,980
point, and then we could use
this formula, which we just

168
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,700
figured out, to figure
out the y-component.

169
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,710
I know it's involved, but it'll
all be worth it, because

170
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,520
you'll know that we have a
constant electric field.

171
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,360
So let's do that.

172
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,385
So first of all, Coulomb's Law
tells us-- well, first of all,

173
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:57,360
let's figure out the charge
from this ring.

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,390
So Q of the ring,
it equals what?

175
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,460
It equals the circumference
of the ring times the

176
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,160
width of the ring.

177
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,230
So let's say the circumference
is 2 pi r, and let's say it's

178
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,675
a really skinny ring.

179
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:14,750
It's really skinny.

180
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,600
It's dr. Infinitesimally
skinny.

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,470
So it's width is dr. So that's
the area of the ring, and so

182
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,340
what's its charge going to be?

183
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,940
It's area times the charge
density, so times sigma.

184
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,890
   

185
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,140
That is the charge
of the ring.

186
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,400
And then what is the electric
field generated by the ring at

187
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,900
this point here where
our test charge is?

188
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,250
Well, Coulomb's Law tells us
that the force generated by

189
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:48,700
the ring is going to be equal
to Coulomb's constant times

190
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,460
the charge of the ring times our
test charge divided by the

191
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,100
distance squared, right?

192
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,350
Well, what's the distance
between really any point on

193
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,400
the ring and our test charge?

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,380
Well, this could be one of the
points on the ring and this

195
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,130
could be another one, right?

196
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,640
And this is like a
cross-section.

197
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,470
So the distance at any point,
this distance right here, is

198
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,410
once again by the Pythagorean
theorem because

199
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,880
this is also r.

200
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,060
This distance is the
square root of h

201
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,140
squared plus r squared.

202
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,710
It's the same thing as that.

203
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:28,290
So it's the distance squared
and that's equal to k times

204
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:35,170
the charge in the ring times
our test charge divided by

205
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:35,970
distance squared.

206
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,560
Well, distance is the square
root of h squared plus r

207
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,820
squared, so if we square
that, it just becomes h

208
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,300
squared plus r squared.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,280
And if we want to know the
electric field created by that

210
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,060
ring, the electric field is
just the force per test

211
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,360
charge, so if we divide both
sides by Q, we learned that

212
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,510
the electric field of the ring
is equal to Coulomb's constant

213
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,540
times the charge in the
ring divided by h

214
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,830
squared plus r squared.

215
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,180
And now what is the
y-component of the

216
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,460
charge in the ring?

217
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,960
Well, it's going to
be this, right?

218
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,890
What we just figured out is the
magnitude of essentially

219
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,250
this vector, right?

220
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,350
But we want its y-component,
because all of the

221
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,950
x-components just cancel out,
so it's going to be times

222
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,790
cosine of theta, and we figured
out that cosine of

223
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,380
theta is essentially this, so
we multiply it times that.

224
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,370
So the field from the ring in
the y-direction is going to be

225
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,850
equal to its magnitude times
cosine of theta, which we

226
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,020
figured out was h over
the square root of h

227
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,780
squared plus r squared.

228
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,740
We could simplify this
a little bit.

229
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,670
The denominator becomes what?

230
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,630
h squared plus r squared
to the 3/2 power.

231
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,210
And what's the numerator?

232
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:13,340
Let's see, we have kh and then
the charge in the ring, which

233
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,310
we solved up here.

234
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:28,180
So that's 2 pi sigma r-- make
sure I didn't lose anything--

235
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,480
dr. So we have just calculated
the y-component, the vertical

236
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,860
component, of the electric
field at h

237
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,270
units above the plate.

238
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,600
And not from the entire plate,
just the electric field

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,530
generated by a ring of radius r
from the base of where we're

240
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,780
taking this height.

241
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,160
And so I've already gone 12
minutes into this video, and

242
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,130
just to give you a break and
myself a break, I will

243
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,230
continue in the next.

244
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,110
But you can imagine what
we're going to do now.

245
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,680
We just figured out the electric
field created by just

246
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,320
this ring, right?

247
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,425
So now we can integrate across
the entire plane.

248
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:11,010
   

249
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,040
We can solve all the rings of
radius infinity all the way

250
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,170
down to zero, and that'll give
us the sum of all of the

251
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,880
electric fields and essentially
the net electric

252
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,460
field h units above the
surface of the plate.

253
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,340
See you in the next video.

254
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,500
