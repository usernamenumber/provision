1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,395
In the last video, using the accrual basis for accounting

2
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:08,395
we had $200 of income in month 2,

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:09,892
but over that same month, we saw that we went

4
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:14,278
from having $100 in cash, to having negative $100

5
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:17,103
in cash, so we actually lost $200 in cash.

6
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:19,061
So how can we reconcile the fact that

7
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,281
it looks like we made $200 in income,

8
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,944
but we lost $200 in cash?

9
00:00:24,944 --> 00:00:27,229
And that reconciliation is going to be done

10
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:28,729
with the cash flow statement.

11
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,564
So most cash flow statements, they'll start

12
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,654
so I'm going to do a cash flow statement right over here

13
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:34,943
So they'll start with your net income

14
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:37,268
or actually they'll start with the cash that you started out with

15
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,065
so they take you from

16
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:42,646
this cash balance to that cash balance.

17
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,311
So they'll say something like

18
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:50,821
Starting cash, we know is $100

19
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,286
And then they'll say well in the most naive

20
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,005
interpretation of things, you net income

21
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,733
in theory should be the cash you're getting

22
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,803
or at least it's some type of profit

23
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,333
you're getting assets in the door

24
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,210
or at least you're counting as if you're

25
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,122
getting some assets in the door.

26
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,651
So then you're having, you have your

27
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:09,809
net income, your net income during the period.

28
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:12,010
And here we'll literally just take whatever is

29
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,682
reported from the income statement.

30
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,924
So over there we get $200 net income,

31
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:19,206
and now we have to do the reconciliation part

32
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:21,178
because if this was all that you were getting,

33
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:23,884
then you should have $300 cash at the end of the period

34
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,344
which we clearly don't have,

35
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,415
so we have to reconcile by looking at the changes

36
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:30,920
in different things on the balance sheet.

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,210
So over here we have a net change

38
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,951
in accounts receivable. So we have an increase

39
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,923
in accounts receivable.

40
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,898
So I'll call it AR increase

41
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,159
AR is short for accounts receivable, just to save some space

42
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,611
So let's just think about it,

43
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,955
when you have an increase in account receivable,

44
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:50,671
you're kind of letting people owe you money

45
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,061
you're letting people owe you $400

46
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,482
if you didn't let them owe you,

47
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,079
that would have been cash,

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,879
so you're kind of pushing back the time

49
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,331
that you're getting cash.

50
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,395
This is $400 that you didn't get

51
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:03,389
that you could have gotten

52
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,877
if you didn't allow, I guess, this person to delay

53
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,077
when they paid you.

54
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,460
So an increase in accounts receivables is

55
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,062
actually less cash than you would have otherwise gotten

56
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:18,133
so this is negative $400 for your cash flow.

57
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,344
And we had no other changes, we haven't even addressed

58
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:23,344
accounts payable, that's essentially pushing back,

59
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:27,701
owing people, paying other people, paying your vendors money,

60
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,831
but I don't even address that in the previous example.

61
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,646
No other changes in our liabilities, so this is

62
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:36,810
the only adjustment we make. And so if we do this,

63
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,945
and sometimes this will be called a use of cash,

64
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:42,677
or a subtraction from, there's different ways

65
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:45,213
it can be phrased in different contexts,

66
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,588
but over here you'll have your net cash

67
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:53,309
from operations. Cash from operations, I'll say ops,

68
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,462
and over here you can see, when you add it all

69
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:58,026
just the cash from operations

70
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:01,268
$200 minus $400, so I'm just adding this part right over here,

71
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,352
you have negative $200

72
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:05,775
and so your starting cash is $100,

73
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:08,490
you have negative $200 cash from operations,

74
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,098
and this is what you would have also gotten

75
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:12,210
if you had done cash accounting,

76
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,983
you would have negative $200 cash from operations,

77
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:18,084
and then, if you start with $100, you use $200

78
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:26,035
in cash, your ending cash will be negative $100.

79
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:27,749
So this little thing that I just created here,

80
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,981
this little reconciliation between the positive $200 in income

81
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,088
and the negative $200 of cash,

82
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,347
it's showing how we got

83
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:38,033
from this starting point in cash to this ending point.

84
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:44,033
This is a cash flow statement, so you now know the 3 major financial statements.
