1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,870
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,100
Where we left off in the last
video, I had just purchased a

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,290
$1 million house.

5
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,220
To do it, I went to the bank and
I said, bank, can you give

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,910
me $750,000?

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,020
They said, sure, Sal, you have
an excellent credit rating,

8
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,190
and you look like an all
around great guy.

9
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,420
So we'll give you $750,000.

10
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,080
And so I took that $750,000 and
the $250,000 that I had

11
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,440
saved up through a lifetime of
hard work, and I went and I

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,540
bought that house.

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,500
After that transaction, this is
what my personal -- well,

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,620
this might not involve
everything, but it could be--

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,770
my personal balance sheet.

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,660
But it looks like my whole
world is this house.

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Which in a lot of cases, it
is, for a lot of people.

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,750
So in this situation,
what are my assets?

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,820
I have a $1 million house
on my balance sheet.

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,430
I have one asset in the world.

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,210
I guess you can't quantify
charisma and good looks.

22
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,990
So the only real tangible
asset I have is

23
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,420
a $1 million house.

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,050
And what are my liabilities?

25
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,990
Well I owe $750,000
to the bank.

26
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,030
And so we learned in the last
video -- and you shouldn't

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,460
view this as a formula.

28
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,410
It should start to make a little
bit of intuitive sense

29
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,640
-- that assets are equal to
liability plus equity.

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,385
Or the other way to view it is,
assets minus liabilities

31
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:11,680
is equal to equity, right?

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
Subtract the liability
from both sides.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,190
And you know that if I have $1
million of assets, I owe

34
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,530
$750,000, if I were to resolve
everything, what I'd have left

35
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,830
over at the end is $250,000.

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,810
And I could make that happen.

37
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,700
I could sell the house for $1
million, hopefully, and then

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,430
pay the bank back.

39
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,130
And I would have
$250,000 left.

40
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,220
So that's what equity is, just
what you have left after you

41
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,820
resolve everything.

42
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,430
Or another way -- and this
makes sense to you.

43
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,710
If you talk about all the things
you own minus all the

44
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,040
things you owe to other
people, equity

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
is what's left over.

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,490
Or that could be
owner's equity.

47
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:46,060
So now let's play with some
scenarios of what happens,

48
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,780
maybe, when the market value
of the house changes.

49
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,760
So let's say, what happens when
-- oh, and one important

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,280
thing to note, this bank,
they're not just going to give

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,080
me $750,000 just to do
anything with it.

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,610
They're not going to say, hey,
Sal, here's $750,000.

53
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,260
I know you'll pay it back
to me, but you can go

54
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,690
gamble it in Monaco.

55
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,470
They want to know that they have
a good chance of getting

56
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,470
at least the money that they
give, the loan amount, and

57
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,100
that is often referred
to as the principal.

58
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,740
They want to know that they're
going to be able to get that

59
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,220
principal back one day.

60
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,230
So what they say is, Sal, we're
only going to give you

61
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,260
this loan, but this loan
has to be backed.

62
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,960
Or it has to be collateralized
by some asset.

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,120
And so what I say is, OK, well,
you know I'm taking this

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,940
loan out to buy a house,
a $1 million house.

65
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,230
If for whatever reason, I lose
my job, or I disappear

66
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,850
somehow, or whatever happens.

67
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,710
If I can't pay you the $750,000,
you get the house.

68
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,610
You'll get this $1
million house.

69
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,800
And right now that looks like
a pretty good deal to the

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,710
bank, right?

71
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,830
They almost hope that I'll
default, because

72
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,840
they gave me $750,000.

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,680
If after a day I just say, you
know what, bank, I can't pay

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,330
this loan, I don't have the
income, or I lost my job, I

75
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,810
can't afford the mortgage.

76
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,350
They get a $1 million
house overnight.

77
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,610
They would have made
$250,000, right?

78
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,700
They would have essentially
gotten all my equity for free.

79
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,220
So in that situation, the bank
works out pretty good.

80
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,620
And that's why they make sure
that there's something that

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,980
they can grab onto if you
can't pay the loan.

82
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,740
And that's why, back in the good
old days, and I think the

83
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,930
good old days are going to come
back again, and I think

84
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,590
they already are -- that the
bank wants you to put some

85
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,100
down payment in a house.

86
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Because there's a situation
where, let's

87
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
say that I do this.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,770
I borrow the money, and
I buy the house.

89
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,050
And I lose my job, or
you know, whatever.

90
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,850
I just drink away all of
my money, whatever

91
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,080
the case may be.

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,210
And so the bank,
they foreclose.

93
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,020
Foreclose means that Sal isn't
paying on his debt, so we're

94
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,880
going to take the collateral
back that he

95
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,420
gave for the loan.

96
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,080
So in that situation, the bank
says, Sal can't pay, we're

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,270
taking that house.

98
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,090
Well when they take that house,
there's a situation

99
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,860
where maybe they're not
going to get $1

100
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,940
million for that house.

101
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,850
They don't want to sit and wait
for months and months and

102
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,980
months while a real estate
agent tries to sell it.

103
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,410
So the bank might just auction
off the house.

104
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,090
And when it auctions off the
house -- actually I think

105
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,790
there are laws that it can't get
more than the mortgage, or

106
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,550
anything more than the mortgage
it gets, it actually

107
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,930
has to pay taxes, or -- we won't
go into all of that.

108
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,550
But it will auction off the
house, and maybe it can only

109
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,769
auction off the house
for $800,000.

110
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,399
Right?

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,070
So the $1 million asset
would really

112
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,980
become an $800,000 asset.

113
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,670
And so the bank keeps this
equity cushion, right?

114
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,350
That if they loan $750,000 for
a $1 million house, and then

115
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,260
the $1 million house only sells
for $800,000, the bank

116
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,190
still gets all of their
money back.

117
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,820
That's why, in the good old
days, the banks wanted you to

118
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,430
put 20% or 25% down, because
they know even if the value of

119
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,560
the house drops by 20%
or 25%, it'll all

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,690
come from your equity.

121
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,810
And maybe I should draw a
diagram to see that situation.

122
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,680
Let's say that for whatever
reason, I have to sell this

123
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,840
house in a fire sale.

124
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,190
Or let's say I can't sell the
house and the bank is forcing

125
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,790
me to liquidate my assets.

126
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,210
The banks says well then,
I want that house back.

127
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,530
So in that situation -- well
actually, that's not a good

128
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,080
situation because the bank
will just -- I'll

129
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,110
just get wiped out.

130
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,290
Let's just do the situation
where let's say a neighbor's

131
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,120
house sells for-- a neighbor's
house that is identical.

132
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,780
An identical neighbor's house,
sells for $800,000, right?

133
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,680
So in that situation, if I want
to be honest with myself,

134
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
and if I want to be honest with
the balance sheet-- and

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,340
actual real companies have to
do this-- I'll say, you know

136
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,450
what, this asset, I have
to revalue it.

137
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,840
I cannot in all honesty say that
this is now worth, that

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,030
this is a $1 million asset.

139
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,860
So I would revalue the asset.

140
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,000
And this is actually called
marking to market.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,480
You probably heard
of this concept.

142
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,810
Marking to market means I have
an asset, and every now and

143
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,625
then, maybe every few months,
every quarter -- a quarter is

144
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,270
just a fourth of a year -- I
have to figure out what that

145
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,240
asset is worth.

146
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,850
And the best way to figure out
what that asset is worth is to

147
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,000
see what identical assets
like that are

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,290
going for on the market.

149
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,340
And very few houses are
completely identical.

150
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,630
Well there are, in
a few suburbs.

151
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,990
Very few assets are completely
identical.

152
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,290
But let's just say that I know
for a fact that an identical

153
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,730
house just sold for $800,000.

154
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,210
So I have to be honest. And I
have to mark it to market, and

155
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:23,940
then say that my assets are
now an $800,000 house.

156
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,680
My same house.

157
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,920
Nothing really happened, but the
market value has dropped

158
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,260
by $200,000 for whatever
reason.

159
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,520
Maybe the car factory nearby
has gone out of business.

160
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,860
So in this situation,
what happens?

161
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,440
What is my new balance sheet?

162
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,490
Well has my liability changed,
because my neighbor's house

163
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,310
sold for less?

164
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,650
Well, no, as far as the bank
is concerned, I still owe

165
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:51,030
$750,000 to the bank.

166
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,440
This is a liability.

167
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,220
I still owe $750,000.

168
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,930
This is assets, of course.

169
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,180
So what's leftover?

170
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,240
What would be left over if I
were to liquidate at the

171
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,630
market price, if I were
to sell the house

172
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,950
at the market price?

173
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,620
Well I would have $50,000
left over.

174
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,590
   

175
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,090
Essentially when the market
price of my asset dropped, all

176
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,670
of that value came
out of my equity.

177
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,710
I'll do actually a whole other
video on the benefits and the

178
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,890
risks of leverage, because
that's very relevant to what's

179
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,200
happening in the world today.

180
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,710
But I think you get a sense
of what's happening.

181
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,230
Equity kind of takes
all of the risk.

182
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,090
So in this situation, this is
why the bank wants you to put

183
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,020
some down payment.

184
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,490
Because the bank, if you can't
pay this loan right here,

185
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,770
they're going to take
your house.

186
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,270
And even in the situation where
the value of the house

187
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,000
went down, if you can't pay the
loan, the bank will still

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,940
be able to get its
$750,000, right?

189
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,390
If you just leave town, or lose
your job, and you just

190
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,060
tell the bank I can't pay
anymore, they're just going to

191
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,540
take this house, sell it,
hopefully for $800,000,

192
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,260
because that's what your
neighbor sold it for.

193
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,020
And they're going to get the
money back for their loan.

194
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,840
So that's why the bank wants you
to put some down payment.

195
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,210
And then there's the other
situation, which is maybe a

196
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,180
more positive situation.

197
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,120
And this is what happened in
much of the world, and

198
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,440
especially in areas like
California and Florida and

199
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,580
Nevada over the last
five years or so.

200
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,060
And I'll do a whole video
on why it happened.

201
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,950
But let's say your neighbor's
house, a year later, didn't

202
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,180
sell for $800,000.

203
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,250
Let's say the identical
neighbor's house

204
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,150
sold for $1.5 million.

205
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,230
And you say, gee whiz.

206
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,250
That's great.

207
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,020
Now my house is also worth
$1.5 million because I'm

208
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
marking to market.

209
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,150
So now my asset -- nothing
has really changed.

210
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,110
It's still the same house.

211
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,669
But I guess, since someone else
sold it for $1.5 million,

212
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,909
I guess I could, too.

213
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,180
So my asset is now a
$1.5 million house.

214
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,920
What are my liabilities?

215
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
Well your liabilities still
haven't changed.

216
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,810
I still owe $750,000 to bank.

217
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,410
This is liabilities.

218
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,280
So what's left over?

219
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,530
What's my equity?

220
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,610
   

221
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,200
Well, assets minus liability.

222
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,860
So I have $750,000 of equity.

223
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,200
That's awesome.

224
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,820
Even though the house
appreciated by 50%, right?

225
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,990
It went from $1 million to $1.5
million, my equity grew

226
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,900
three-fold.

227
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,020
It appreciated by 200%.

228
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,650
I think you're starting to get
the benefits of what happens

229
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,410
when you do leverage.

230
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,750
Leverage is when you use
debt to buy an asset.

231
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,840
But when you use leverage, the
return that you get on your

232
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,550
asset gets multiplied when you
get the return on your equity.

233
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,070
I hope I'm not confusing you.

234
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,150
But in this situation,
all of a sudden I

235
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,610
have a ton of equity.

236
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,230
And I'm running out of time.

237
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,760
But in the next video
I'm going to talk

238
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,820
about how this happened.

239
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,200
Because you saw it in a
lot of neighborhoods.

240
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,370
A lot of houses appreciated
from about 2001 to 2005.

241
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,830
And people, all of a sudden,
just sitting on their house,

242
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,130
ended up with a lot of equity.

243
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,380
And they felt that, wow, I just
went from having $250,000

244
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,050
of net wealth to $750,000
of wealth,

245
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,900
without doing anything.

246
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,940
Just by my neighbor's house
selling for more.

247
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,190
I'll see you in the next video.

248
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,970
