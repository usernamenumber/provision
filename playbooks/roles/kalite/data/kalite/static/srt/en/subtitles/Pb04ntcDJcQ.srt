1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,600
OK, I filled your brain with a
bunch of partial derivatives

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,920
and psi's, with respect
to x's and y's.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,820
I think now it's time to
actually do it with a real

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,400
differential equation,
and make things a

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,195
little bit more concrete.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:16,640
So let's say I have the
differential, y, the

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,570
differential equation, y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:34,360
y, plus sine of x, plus-- I'm
already running out of space--

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,140
x squared, e to the y,
minus 1, times y

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,970
prime, is equal to 0.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,090
Well, your brain is already,
hopefully, in exact

12
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,310
differential equations mode.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,510
But if you were to see this
pattern in general, where you

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,690
see a function of x and y,
here-- this is just some

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,870
function of x and y-- and then
you have another function of x

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,440
and y, times y prime, or times
dy, d of x, your brain should

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,950
immediately say if this
is inseparable.

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,180
And I'm not going to try to
make it separable, just

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,530
because that'll take
a lot of time.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,460
But if it's not separable, your
brain said, oh, maybe

21
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,850
this is an exact equation.

22
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,350
And, you say, let
me test whether

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,040
this is an exact equation.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,300
So if this is an exact equation,
this is our function

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,160
M, which is a function
of x and y.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,670
And this is our function
N, which is a

27
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,140
function of x and y.

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,700
Now, the test is to see if the
partial of this, with respect

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,290
to y, is equal to the partial
of this, with respect to x.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,420
So let's see.

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,240
The partial of M, with respect
to y, is equal to-- let's see,

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,480
y is-- so this cosine of x is
just a constant, so it's just

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,460
cosine of x.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,610
Cosine of x plus-- now,
what's the derivative?

35
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,725
Well, 2x is just a constant,
what's the derivative of e to

36
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:50,820
the y, with respect to y?

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,350
Well, it's just e
to the y, right?

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,110
So we have the constant on
the outside, 2x times the

39
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,810
derivative, with respect to
y, so it's 2xe to the y.

40
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,910
Fair enough.

41
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,430
Now, what is the partial
derivative of this, with

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,950
respect to x?

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,100
So N sub x, or the partial of
N, with respect to x-- so

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,360
what's the derivative of sine
of x, with respect to x?

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,630
Well, that's easy, that's cosine
of x, plus 2x times e

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,830
to the y, right? e and y is just
a constant, because y is

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,030
constant when we're taking the
partial, with respect to x.

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,550
So plus 2xe to the y.

49
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,800
And then minus 1, the derivative
of a constant, with

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,450
respect to anything
is going to be 0.

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,310
So the derivative of N-- the
partial of N, with respect to

52
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,460
x, is cosine of x, plus 2xe to
the y, which, lo and behold,

53
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,000
is the same thing as the
derivative, the partial of M,

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,120
with respect to y.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,190
So there we have it.

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,860
We've shown that M of y is equal
to-- or the partial of

57
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,230
M, with respect to y-- is equal
to the partial of N,

58
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,510
with respect to x, which
tells us that

59
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,040
this is an exact equation.

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,380
Now, given that this is an exact
equation-- oh, my wife

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,120
snuck up behind me,
I was wondering.

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,150
I thought there was
some critter in

63
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,820
my house, or something.

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,440
Anyway, so we know that this is
an exact equation, so what

65
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,020
does that tell us?

66
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,990
Well, that tells us that there's
some psi, where the

67
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,060
partial derivative of psi, with
respect to x, is equal to

68
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,420
M, and the partial derivative of
psi, with respect to y, is

69
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,600
equal to N.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
And if we know that psi,
then we can rewrite our

71
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,090
differential equation as the
derivative of psi, with

72
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,450
respect to x, is equal to 0.

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,790
So let's solve for psi.

74
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,765
So we know that the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is

75
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,390
equal to M.

76
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,160
So we could write that.

77
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,820
We could write the partial of
psi, with respect to x, is

78
00:03:50,820 --> 00:04:01,110
equal to M, which is y cosine
of x, plus 2xe to the y.

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,600
That's just here.

80
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,570
That's my M of x.

81
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,440
We could have done
it the other way.

82
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,160
We could have said the partial
of y-- the partial of psi,

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,220
with respect to y, is this
thing over here.

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,430
But let's just do it with x.

85
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,910
Now, to at least get kind of a
first approximation of what

86
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,930
psi-- not an approximation, but
to start to get a sense of

87
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,829
it-- let's take the derivative
of both sides, with respect

88
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,000
to-- sorry, take the
antiderivative-- take the

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,270
integral of both sides,
with respect to x.

90
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,280
So if you take the derivative of
this, with respect to x, if

91
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,800
you integrate-- sorry, if
you were to take the

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,220
antiderivative of this,
with respect to x.

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,836
So let me just write
that down.

94
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,520
The partial, with
respect to x.

95
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
We're going to [? integrate ?]

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,820
it, with respect to x.

97
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,030
That is going to be equal to
the integral of this whole

98
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,820
thing, with respect to x.

99
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,940
Cosine of x plus 2xe to the y.

100
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,870
We're integrating with
respect to x.

101
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,220
And normally when you integrate
with respect to x,

102
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,430
you'd say, OK, plus c, right?

103
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,000
But it actually could be a
plus-- since this is a

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,740
partial, with respect to x, we
could have had some function

105
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,045
of y here in general, because
y, we treat it

106
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,730
as a constant, right?

107
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,300
And that makes sense, because
if you were to take the

108
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,110
partial of both sides of this,
with respect to x, if you were

109
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,430
to take the partial of a
function that is only a

110
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,420
function of y, with respect
to x, you would

111
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,880
have gotten a 0 here.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
So when you take the
antiderivative, you were,

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,190
like, oh well, there might have
been some function of y

114
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,780
here that we lost when
we took the partial,

115
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,790
with respect to x.

116
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,690
So anyway, this will
simplify to psi.

117
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,710
psi is going to be equal to the
integral, with respect to

118
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,340
x, or the antiderivative, with
respect to x, here, plus some

119
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,130
function of y that we might
have lost when we took the

120
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,520
partial, with respect to x.

121
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,260
So let's do that.

122
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
Let's figure out
this integral.

123
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,890
I'll do it in blue So y
is just a constant.

124
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,310
So the antiderivative of y
cosine of x, is just y sine of

125
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:04,020
x, plus-- either the y
is constant, so 2x.

126
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,060
The antiderivative of 2x, with
respect to x, is x squared, so

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,920
it's x squared e to the y.

128
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,440
And then plus some
function of y.

129
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,540
And if you want to verify this,
you should take the

130
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,080
partial of this, with
respect to x.

131
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,200
If you take the partial of
this, with respect to x,

132
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,780
you're going to get this in
here, which is our function,

133
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,310
M, up here.

134
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,190
And then when you take the
partial of this, with respect

135
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,720
to x, you'll get 0, and
it'll get lost. OK, so

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,430
we're almost there.

137
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,270
We've almost figured out our
psi, but we still need to

138
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,030
figure out this function of y.

139
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,880
Well, we know that if we take
the partial of this, with

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,340
respect to y, since this
is an exact equation,

141
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,210
we should get this.

142
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,410
We should get our N function.

143
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,150
So let's do that.

144
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,540
So the partial-- I'll switch
notation, just to expose you

145
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,340
to it-- the partial psi, with
respect to y, is going to be

146
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,160
equal to-- so here, y sine
of x, sine of x is just a

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,420
constant. y is just y, so the
derivative of this, with

148
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,030
respect to y, is
just sine of x.

149
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,300
Plus the derivative of e to the
y is e to the y. x squared

150
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,950
is just a constant.

151
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,600
So it's just x squared e to
the y, plus-- what's the

152
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,120
partial of f of y, with
respect to y?

153
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,900
It's going to be f prime of y.

154
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,530
Well, what did we do?

155
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,230
We took M, we integrated with
respect to x, and we said,

156
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,270
well, we might have lost some
function of y, so we added

157
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,060
that to it.

158
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,740
And then we took the partial of
that side that we've almost

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,470
constructed, and we took
the partial of that,

160
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,040
with respect to y.

161
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,940
Now, we know, since this is
exact, that that is going to

162
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,960
equal our N.

163
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,670
So our N is up there.

164
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,585
Cosine of x plus-- So that's
going to be equal to-- I want

165
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:57,720
to make sure I can read it up
there-- to our N, right?

166
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,390
Oh no, sorry.

167
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,930
N is up here.

168
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,540
Our N is up here.

169
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,150
Sine of x-- let me write
that-- sine of x plus x

170
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,450
squared, e to the y, minus 1.

171
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:13,760
So sine of x plus x squared,
e to the y, minus 1.

172
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,350
That was just our N,
from our original

173
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,470
differential equation.

174
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,720
And now we can solve
for f prime of y.

175
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,010
So let's see, we get sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,

176
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:39,364
plus f prime of y, is equal to
sine of x plus x squared, e to

177
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:42,150
the y, minus 1.

178
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,600
So let's see, we can delete
sine of x from both sides.

179
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,640
We can delete x squared e to
the y from both sides.

180
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,740
And then what are
we left with?

181
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,750
We're left with f prime
of y is equal to 1.

182
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,610
And then we're left with f of
y is equal to-- well, it

183
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,720
equals y plus some constant,
c, right?

184
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,350
So what is our psi now?

185
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,040
We wrote our psi up here, and we
had this f of y here, so we

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,600
can rewrite it now.

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
So psi is a function of x and
y-- we're actually pretty much

188
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
almost done solving it-- psi
is a function of x and y is

189
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:41,010
equal to y sine of x, plus x
squared, e to the y, plus y--

190
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,860
oh, sorry, this is f prime
of y, minus 1.

191
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,330
So this is a minus 1.

192
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,350
So this is a minus y plus c.

193
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,370
So this is going to be
a minus y plus c.

194
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,560
So we've solved for psi.

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,800
And so what does that tell us?

196
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,390
Well, we said that original
differential equation, up

197
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,390
here, using the partial
derivative chain rule, that

198
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,270
original differential equation,
can be rewritten now

199
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:10,740
as the derivative dx of psi is
equal to-- psi is a function

200
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,570
of x and y-- is equal to 0.

201
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,560
Or if you were to integrate both
sides of this, you would

202
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:26,630
get that psi of xy is equal
to c is a solution of that

203
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,430
differential equation.

204
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,020
So if we were to set this is
equal to c, that's the

205
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,700
differential equation.

206
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:37,530
So we could say, y sine of x
plus x squared, e to the y,

207
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,890
minus y-- now we could say, plus
this c-- plus this c, you

208
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,990
call it c1, is equal to c2.

209
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,143
Well, you could subtract the c's
from both sides, and just

210
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,520
be left with a c at the end.

211
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,380
But anyway, we have solved
this exact equation, one,

212
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,220
first, by recognizing it was
exact, by taking the partial

213
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,670
of this, with respect to y, and
seeing if that was equal

214
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,110
to the partial of N,
with respect to x.

215
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,000
Once we saw that they were
equal, we're like, OK, this is

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,090
going to be exact.

217
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,850
So let's figure out psi.

218
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,340
Since this is exact, M is going
to be the partial of

219
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,000
psi, with respect to x.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,700
N is the partial of psi,
with respect to y.

221
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,570
Then to figure out y, we
integrated M, with respect to

222
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,130
x, and we got this.

223
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,500
But since we said, oh, well,
instead of a plus c, it could

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,520
have been a function of y there,
because we took the

225
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,140
partial, with respect to x, so
this might have been lost. To

226
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,100
figure out the function of y,
we then took our psi that we

227
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,960
figured out, took the partial
of that, with

228
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,290
respect to y, got this.

229
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,450
And we said, this was an exact
equation, so this is going to

230
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,710
equal our N of x y.

231
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,750
We set those equal to each
other, and then we

232
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,420
solved for f of y.

233
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,690
And then we had our final psi.

234
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,320
Our final psi was this.

235
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,500
And then the differential
equation, because of the chain

236
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,270
rule of partial derivatives,
we could rewrite the

237
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,330
differential equation as this.

238
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,000
The solution is this, and so
this is the solution to our

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,510
differential equation.

240
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,780
See you in the next video.
