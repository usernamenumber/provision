1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,350
All right. We are on problem number ten.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,740
This says the absolute value of 10 minus k is equal to 3.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,560
And that we know that the absolute value of k minus 5 is

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,020
equal to 8. And they say,

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,860
what is the value of k that satisfies both equations above?

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,790
Well let's do the first one.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,970
The absolute value of 10 minus k is equal to 3.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,280
That tells us that 10 minus k is equal to 3,

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,530
or 10 minus k is equal to minus 3.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,340
If 10 minus k is 3,just based on the first equation alone,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,610
I get k is equal to 7. 10 minus 7 is equal to 3.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,630
And here,k is equal to 13. So just on this first constraint,

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,790
we have k is equal to 7 or 13.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,980
So now let's do the second constraint,

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,420
and I'll do it in yellow. So k minus 5 is 8.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,520
That absolute value is equal to 8,so it's either k minus 5

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,230
is equal to 8,or k minus 5 is equal to minus 8.

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,890
If k minus 5 is 8,then k is 13.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,850
If k minus 5 is equal to minus 8,

20
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,470
then that means k is equal to minus 3.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,270
In order for k to satisfy both of this equations,

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,950
I've just kind of solved it.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,690
What k satisfies both of these equations?

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,520
Well 7 only satisfies the first one,

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,660
and negative 3 only satisfies the second one.

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:38,170
But 13,k equals 13,satisfies both. So that is your answer.

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,360
13. Next problem.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,120
Problem number eleven. I've gotta do some drawing.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,120
I think I'm going to go for a walk after this.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,000
I need to work off that turkey.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,180
I have a line here,that's line M.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,050
I have line L,something like that.

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,700
And then I have this perpendicular line,

34
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,410
up here like that. And then what do they tell us?

35
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,380
They tell us that this is perpendicular.

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,680
Let me switch colors. They tell us that this is 65 degrees.

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,600
They tell us that this,right here,is x degrees.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh,and there's another line there,I haven't even drawn it.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,150
There's another line,that I haven't drawn,that is this.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,100
Switching back to the green.

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,560
This is 20 degrees,and so this is x.

42
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,450
x is just this thing right here,not this whole thing.

43
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,740
This is 20 degrees.

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,380
What is the value of x in the figure above?

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,020
So we just gotta do what I like to affectionately call

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,250
the angle game. And the angle game,

47
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,600
I just try to figure out as many angles as I can figure out.

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,350
So what is the measure of this angle?

49
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,960
Well this angle and this angle are complementary.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,300
They add up to 90 degrees.

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,410
We know this is 90,so this whole thing is 90.

52
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,010
So if this and this add up to 90,what is this?

53
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,690
25 plus 65 is 90,correct? Yes.

54
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,520
You can tell addition is my weak point.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,000
So this is 25 degrees,this is 20 degrees.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,560
Can we figure out x? Well,sure.

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,600
We know that all of these 3 angles combined

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,090
have to add up to 180 now.

59
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,260
Because they're all kind of collectively supplementry.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,360
You go around,you go halfway around the circle.

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,110
So we know that x plus 20 plus 25 is equal 180.

62
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,590
x plus 45 is equal to 180.

63
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:12,450
So x is equal to,this is where I always mess up,

64
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:19,570
so x is equal to 135. So that's our answer. Next problem.

65
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,770
So number twelve.

66
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,400
That last problem was one that my cousin had marked up pretty

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,430
incorrectly,so I had to take some pause just to make sure

68
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,710
I didn't mark it up incorrectly. OK.

69
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,480
Problem number twelve.

70
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,060
The median of a set of 9 consecutive integers is 42.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,380
What is the greatest of these integers?

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,460
So the median of 9 consecutive integers is 42.

73
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:09,050
So 42 is the middle number,and there's 9 consecutive numbers.

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,930
How many numbers are going to be greater than 42?

75
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,470
Median means middle.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:28,330
So that means there are 4 greater and 4 less.

77
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,880
Because there's a total of 9 numbers.

78
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,230
4 less,42,and then 4 greater.And they're consecutive numbers,

79
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,080
so what are going to be the 4 numbers greater that it?

80
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,170
Well 43,44,45,46.

81
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,070
The question asks us,what is the greatest of the numbers?

82
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,650
Well sure,it's going to be 46.

83
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,800
And you could have written out all the numbers,but you know

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,300
42 is the middle,there are 4 greater and 4 less,just do 4.

85
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,130
It saves you a little time. Problem number thirteen.

86
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:11,460
Let the function f be defined by f of x is equal to x plus 1.

87
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:19,910
If 2f of p is equal to 20. So 2 times f of p is equal to 20.

88
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,900
What is the value of f of 3p? This looks fun.

89
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,480
So 2 times f of p is equal to 20,what is f of 3p?

90
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,830
So let's evaluate 2 times f of p.

91
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:43,200
2 times f of p,well that equals 2 times p plus 1.

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,850
We know that equals 20.

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,360
And so you know that 2p plus 2,I just distributed the 2,

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,280
is equal to 20. 2p is equal to 18,p is equal to 9.

95
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,950
We just solve for p.

96
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,980
They're just trying to confuse you with notation.

97
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,330
There's nothing really that fancy here.

98
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,800
It's a very simple equation to solve.

99
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,650
And once you know p equals 9,then we say f of 3p,

100
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,810
that's the same thing,because p equals 9,f of 27.

101
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,780
And now this becomes just a simple function evaluation.

102
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:24,070
f of 27 is equal to 27 plus 1. 27 plus 1 is just 28.

103
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,290
That's it. Next problem. Problem number fourteen.

104
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll do in green.

105
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,680
Problem number fourteen. I have to do some drawing now.

106
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,390
I'll do it big because it looks complicated. Big line there.

107
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,640
I have another line here that's almost horizontal.

108
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,300
And then this looks like it's perpendicular,it is.

109
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:03,560
And then we'll go like that there.

110
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,730
And add another perpendicular line like that.

111
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:24,320
That's a nice looking drawing. So then this is J,K,L,N,M.

112
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,900
They tell us that this is 90 degrees,it's perpendicular.

113
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,990
This is x degrees.They also tell us that this is 125 degrees.

114
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,870
They also tell us that this is perpendicular.

115
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,760
In the figure above,KN is perpendicular to JL.

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,190
We knew that because they drew it.

117
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,120
And LM is perpendicular to JL.

118
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,770
We knew that because they drew that there.

119
00:08:53,770 --> 00:09:07,960
If the lengths of LN and LM are equal,these are equal lengths

120
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,160
what is the value of x?

121
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,210
Well if we know that these 2 sides are equal,

122
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,400
what do we also know about its base angles?

123
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,230
This angle is going to have to be equal to this angle.

124
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,790
So if that angle is equal to that angle,

125
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,910
let's figure out what that is.

126
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,730
If this purple angle here is 125,what is this?

127
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,480
Well they're supplementary,so they add up to 180.

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,170
So this is 125. I just realized

129
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,250
I only have 35 seconds left to do this problem.

130
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,020
Actually,I will continue it in the next video,

131
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,610
because I only have 20 seconds now to do this.

132
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,810
So I'll see you in the next video.
