1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,670
We're on problem 201 which I had continued in the last video,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,100
but, frankly, I had bad reading comprehension.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,400
I had read the first statement wrong,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,900
and I went down an incorrect path.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,380
So let me read it correctly.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,270
If the sum of n consecutive integers is 0,

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,000
which of the following must be true?

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,530
So I have n numbers in the row, and their sum has to be 0.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,630
So, first of all, that tells us that some of them have to

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,940
be positive and some of them have to be negative.

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,430
And they're consecutive, right?

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,350
So if we put this as 0--

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,170
let's think about how we can even construct this,

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,450
how this could ever happen.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,110
n consecutive numbers, the sum being 0.

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,070
Really in order to do that--

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,970
and they're consecutive, which is a trick.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:55,090
If a is one of the numbers, then, really,

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,030
negative a has to be one of the numbers as well.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,380
And why is that?

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
You might say, oh well why can't I have some other set of

22
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,770
negative numbers that offset a? Well,

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,210
the key here is that we're dealing with consecutive numbers.

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,090
Because those other negative numbers are going to have to

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,270
offset all of the other positive numbers in between.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,180
Maybe I should do this with more abstract.

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,050
Let's say that n is equal to 1.

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,680
The sum of n consecutive integers is 0.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,590
So, first of all, can n equal 1? Well sure.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,680
Only if that one integer is 0. Now what if n is equal to 2?

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,740
Can n equal 2? Well let's think about it.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,740
We have to add one integer to thisŁŹ

33
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,000
and they're integers right?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,650
So if we add one integer-if we add any positive integer here,

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:49,010
a, then the sum is going to be 0 plus a.

36
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,690
If you're going to cross the negative boundary,

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,740
if you're going to cross 0, 0 has to be one of your integers.

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,310
So that's always going to be counted.

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,040
So, in order to get into negative a,

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,740
you need to have at least three integers.

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,730
So, if I said that n is equal to 3, you could do 1,

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,010
0, and minus 1.

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,510
Now, if n is equal to 4, can I just add one number?

44
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,510
Can I add either 2 or negative 2?

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,650
No, that'll change the sum again.

46
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,410
So I have to add a 2 and a minus 2.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,440
So I think you could see here that there's a pattern because

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,270
0 is always going to be one of the integers and

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,950
it's symmetric on the right- or left-hand side.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,550
We're always going to have an odd number of integers

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,900
we're summing up. So we know that n is odd.

52
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,140
So, we know statement one. They say statement one, n even.

53
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,300
That's not true.

54
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,420
We actually can't construct it with n as even.

55
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,760
Statement two says, n is odd which we've just shown.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
And then statement three is,

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,080
the average of the n integers is 0. Well sure.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,070
What's the average?It's the sum of the integers divided by n.

59
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,730
Well, they're telling us that the sum of the integers is 0.

60
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,900
So 0 divided by anything,

61
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,380
as long as we don't have zero integers, is 0.

62
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,760
So two and three are both correct. So the choice is e.

63
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,150
Next question.

64
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,500
202.

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:46,570
In the formula, v is equal to 1 over 2r cubed.

66
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,730
If r is halved, then v is multiplied by what?

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,000
The easiest thing I always find to do in this is take numbers

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,760
So let's say, if r is 2 what happens?

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,610
And let's halve it when r equals 1 and see what happens to v.

70
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,900
We can do it analytically, but this is, frankly,

71
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,040
the easiest way to do it.

72
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,870
So you can say when r is equal to 2,

73
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,180
v is equal to 1 over 2 times 2,is 4,to the third power is 64.

74
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,100
And then when r is 1, you get 1 over-- let's see,

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,110
2 times 1 is 2 to the third power.

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,010
So you get 1/8. So what happened to v?

77
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:30,020
We, essentially, multiplied that by 8. So that is choice b.

78
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,800
To go from 1/64 to 1/8 you have to multiply by 8.

79
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,890
You can view 1/8 as the same thing as 8/64

80
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,030
if that clarifies it at all.

81
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,140
I always find it easier to deal with actual physical numbers

82
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,400
where they say, if you change this variable by a

83
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,010
factor of 5 what happened to that variable?

84
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,080
So easy to just-- well anyway.

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,130
It could get very confusing if you try to do an r1 and an r2,

86
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,080
and r1 is 2 times r2 and all that.

87
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,340
Next question. 203.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,280
A certain bakery has six employees.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,380
It pays annual salaries of $14,000 to each of two employees.

90
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,340
$16,000 to one employee.

91
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,570
And $17,000 to each of the remaining three employees.

92
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,380
The average annual salary of these employees is closest to

93
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,980
which of the following? So,

94
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,040
we have to take the sum of all their salaries and divide by 6

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,450
So it'll be 2 times 14, plus 1 times 16-- which is 16,

96
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,000
plus 3 times 17, and we divide it by 6.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,020
2 times 14 is 28, plus 16, plus 51, all of that over 6.

98
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,740
Let's see, what is that equal to?

99
00:05:52,770 --> 00:06:02,400
28, 16, 51, 8 plus 6 is 14, 14 plus 1 is 15, 1 plus 2 is 3,

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:09,510
3 plus 1 is 4, 4 plus 5 is 9. This was 8 plus 6.

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,000
So, it's 95 divided by 6. Sorry, 95 divided by 6.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think my brain was computing ahead of me

103
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,770
because 96 divided by 6 is equal to 16.

104
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,470
So this number is going to be just under 16. It's 15 and 5/6.

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,440
So they want to get an approximate, as close as-- oh,

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,430
actually they have a lot of numbers that are really close.

107
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,230
Let me make sure that I get it right.

108
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,770
So, 6 goes into 95-- if they didn't have numbers that

109
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,330
weren't close, I wouldn't do this.

110
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,540
6 goes into 95, 6 into 9, 6.

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,050
35, goes 5 times, 5 times 6 is 30, remainder of 5.

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,060
Actually let's keep going because we want a decimal.

113
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,730
We're doing it in thousands So, bring down a 0.

114
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,110
6 goes into 50 8 times. 8 times 6 is 48.

115
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,150
Remember, we were dealing in thousands when I said 16,

116
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,080
that was thousands. So, now we're at 15.8 thousand.

117
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,580
So 8 times 48, 20, 6 goes into 20 3 times.

118
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
I think that's close enough to what we need.

119
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,070
So it's going to be roughly $15,800.

120
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,040
Or 15.8 thousands. And that is choice C.

121
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,390
At first I said maybe we can approximate,

122
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,830
and they had 16,000 there, but then I saw the 15,800

123
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,410
so we should do a little bit more math.

124
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,900
We don't want to get too careless.

125
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,280
Next problem. 204.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,410
If x is equal to the sum of the even integers from 40 to

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,490
60 inclusive.

128
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,190
This is my ad hoc notation.

129
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,190
And y is the number of even integers.

130
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,150
Let's see, if x is equal to the sum of the even integers

131
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,880
from 40 to 60, inclusive, so it includes 40 and 60,

132
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,730
and y is the number of even integers from 40 to 60 inclusive,

133
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,440
what is the value of x plus y?

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,370
The number-- y is an easy thing.

135
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,000
How many integers are there between 40 and 60,

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
if you include both of them?

137
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,640
This is always a tricky thing to think about.

138
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,810
But, if you think about it, if I said the numbers 1,2, and 3,

139
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,690
how many integers are there here?

140
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,020
Well, clearly, you can count them. 1, 2, and 3.

141
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,000
But if you wanted a quick way you could say 3 minus--

142
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,310
if I just took the endpoint minus the starting point,

143
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,020
I would get these integers. Then I want to add 1.

144
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,300
If I want to know how integers are there between 60 and 40,

145
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,450
I would say 60 minus 40.

146
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,810
And that'll give me 41,42, 43, 44, all the way to 59, and 60.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,590
And then I have to add 1 because we're including 40 as well.

148
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,790
So y is equal to 21. Now let's think about,

149
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,880
is there an easy way to add up all of the integers between 40

150
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,790
and-- all of the even, oh no, no sorry.

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,850
y is the number of even integers from 40 to 60.

152
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,870
So that's not right. So, even integers.

153
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,010
Frankly,it might just be easier to-let's just write them out.

154
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:56,070
40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, and 60.

155
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:05,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 11 intergers. So that's y.

156
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,010
And we need to take the sum of all of these.

157
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,030
So there's a couple of ways we could think about it.

158
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:17,570
You could view this as 40 plus 0, 40 plus 2,

159
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,400
40 plus 3, and so forth. All the way to 40 plus 8.

160
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:27,490
And so if you wanted to add up at least up to this point,

161
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,850
it's a pretty straightforward way of doing it.

162
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,370
You could just say, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of them.

163
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,470
So it's equal to 40 times 5. That adds up all the 40's.

164
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,030
Plus 2, plus 4, plus 6, plus 8.

165
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:48,820
So 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 6 is 12, plus 8 is 20. So, plus 20.

166
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:56,060
So, that's 40 times 5 is what? 200 plus 20 is equal to 220.

167
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,000
And you use the same logic here.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is 50 plus 0, 50 plus 2, all the way to 50 plus 10.

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,390
And how many are there? There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

170
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:20,200
So, it's equal to 6 times 50, plus 2 plus 4 is 6,

171
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,100
plus 6 is 12, plus 8 is 20. Which we actually already knew.

172
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
We already calculated it there. It was 20.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,330
Because these don't contribute to the-- oh no, no plus 10.

174
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,000
Sorry, plus 10. Don't want to get careless. Plus 10.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,430
Because there's six of these.

176
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,030
There's plus 0, plus 2, plus 4, plus 6, plus 8, plus 10.

177
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,550
So, it's 20 plus 10 is 30.

178
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,470
2 plus 4 plus 6 plus 8 plus 10 is 30.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:57,030
So,6 times 5 is 300,plus 30 is equal to 330. So,330 plus 220.

180
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,560
These numbers have a strange pattern that-- well

181
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,510
there is a formula if you want to add the first n numbers,

182
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,110
but they've changed it a little bit by talking about

183
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,080
even numbers so I wanted to do it manually.

184
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,060
So you go 0, 5, 5. So 550 is the sum.

185
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,430
And then we know that y-- this is x. x is equal to 550.

186
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,020
And y is equal to 11. We figured that out before.

187
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:30,030
So x plus y is equal to 550, plus 11 which is equal to 561,

188
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,550
which is, thank goodness, actually one of the choices.

189
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,080
That's choice D.

190
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,050
