1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
In the last video we talked about pensions

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,679
and how there're defined benefit plans

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:07,380
and how they could get underfunded

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,011
of how there could be temptation for people to underfund them

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,796
In this video I want to make things a little bit more concrete

6
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:16,494
by looking on actual numbers especially at the state level

7
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:21,788
So right over here is a map of obviously the United States

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:27,494
and what it shows is how funded the pension liabilities are in the different states

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,971
so for example

10
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:29,737
actually Texas for example

11
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:35,056
83% of their pension liabilities are funded

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:40,742
They set aside 83% of they right amount of money for their pension obligations

13
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,562
Not 100% it is underfunded

14
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,064
but it's not crazy

15
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:45,432
California, pretty high

16
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:49,818
78% but one of these states is jumping out to you

17
00:00:49,818 --> 00:00:52,137
probably because it's been shaded in red

18
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,232
and that is the state of Illinois

19
00:00:55,232 --> 00:00:57,794
and Illinois is in trouble because

20
00:00:57,794 --> 00:01:02,124
it's only funded 45% of its pension obligations

21
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:04,277
and Illinois really jumps out because

22
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:05,392
it's in red

23
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:07,512
but there're a lot of states pretty close to Illinois

24
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:14,529
Louisiana 56$, Oklahoma 56%, Kentucky 54%, West Virginia 58%

25
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:16,002
and this is an issue because

26
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,339
it's set a side in the past very little money

27
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,920
for the pension obligations that are starting to hit now

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,146
especially if you have a retiring baby boomer population

29
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:26,673
and in order to meet those obligations

30
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,001
those promised obligations

31
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,958
they're going to have to dig into money

32
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,406
that was being spent in other places

33
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,264
that going in the past when they were under funding the pension

34
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,919
they were able to fund other things nicely

35
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,387
but not fund the pension

36
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,151
and kind of kick the can down the road

37
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:44,844
but now that the can can't be kicked any further

38
00:01:44,844 --> 00:01:46,930
it's going to have to go the other way around

39
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,559
you're going to have to take money from other things to fund your pensions

40
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,695
and to make it clear

41
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,374
let's focus on the state of Illinois

42
00:01:54,374 --> 00:01:57,554
So this right over here there're a couple of things going on

43
00:01:57,554 --> 00:02:00,272
In this kind of yellow ochre colour

44
00:02:00,272 --> 00:02:02,532
and I'll circle it in yellow-ochre

45
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,512
they're talking about the total liabilities

46
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,056
and just to make this graph clear

47
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:08,694
it's not just about the total liabilities

48
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:12,109
the entire height of each of these bars is the total

49
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:15,564
is the total liabilities

50
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:18,278
and you see how it's just completely

51
00:02:18,278 --> 00:02:20,344
it's completely blossomed here

52
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,650
and there're a lot of things that go into the total liabilities

53
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,873
the same things that we talked about in the last video

54
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:29,000
they're things like return on investment

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,427
Return on investment

56
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:34,396
if you're in a low interest rate environment like we are right now

57
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,146
For example in my savings account

58
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,876
I think is getting like 0.4% interest

59
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,583
It's getting pretty much no interest

60
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:43,521
If you're in a low interest rate environment

61
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,210
if your're not getting good returns

62
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,807
a lot of pensions tend to go into very safe assets

63
00:02:47,807 --> 00:02:49,782
but those are going to get very low returns

64
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,097
you're going to have to set aside

65
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,516
more money

66
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:52,872
And so

67
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:58,780
you see these obligations essentially just growing dramatically

68
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,189
on top of that you have things like cost of living adjustments

69
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:07,712
These are attempts at kind of factoring in inflation

70
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,432
how much things are costing in that region

71
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,849
but there are also negotiated

72
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,865
and especially in the case of Illinois

73
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:17,495
they've grown faster than the rate of inflation

74
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:19,326
And so you have these liabilities

75
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,592
and you see they're getting less and less well funded

76
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,346
So if we go right over here

77
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:24,763
and this is what this green line is

78
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,697
the funding ratio so how well funded are these liabilities

79
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:31,339
red says the red part of the bar that is not paid for

80
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:37,928
and the green is the ratio of what is funded

81
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:40,629
essentially this higher part

82
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:46,289
is the ratio of this part right over here to the entire bar

83
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,978
And you see right over here

84
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,161
Illinois is in a bad situation

85
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:54,913
Their total liabilities are 138 billion

86
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:55,626
this is in millions

87
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,458
so it's a 138 thousand milllions

88
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,420
so it's 138 billion

89
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,794
This is for 1 state

90
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:05,615
and 85 or 86 billion of that is unfunded

91
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,043
that they have to figure our somewhere to get the money

92
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:11,758
because the right amount of money was not being set aside

93
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:16,305
And to do that they're going to have to dig into other things

94
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,489
so this right over here

95
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,005
this is the pension contribution

96
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,407
let me circle this

97
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:24,605
so in this yellow colour right over here is the pension contribution

98
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:25,636
and now the state

99
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:28,876
in order to get to a funded position

100
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,601
they're going to have to make up for the underfunding of the past

101
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,666
and also the other factors that are making this obligation even larger

102
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,271
they're going to have to dig into other things

103
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,996
and so you see right over here in yellow

104
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:43,210
these are the pensions

105
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,061
these are the contributions they're going to have to make for the pensions

106
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,282
and you see that growing

107
00:04:47,282 --> 00:04:51,870
it's going in excess by 2018 of 6 billion a year

108
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,542
but what's really fascinating about this graph

109
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:57,941
is that it's passing total education funding in the state

110
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,859
so the cost of funding retirements

111
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:05,909
for people who have already done service for the state

112
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:08,273
but aren't in service to the state right now

113
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,908
is going to pass up

114
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,418
and this is happening very soon

115
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:17,093
is going to pass up actual spending on a state-wide basis on education

116
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:18,809
and at the state level

117
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,081
education is a major major major expenditure

118
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:23,804
so it's going to be passing up a major expenditure

119
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:27,626
a very important expenditure on the future of the state

120
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:30,541
based on past obligations

121
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,329
and to understand where this is going

122
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,081
and just to understand Illinois' situation

123
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,232
there are 750 thousand

124
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:38,962
Illinois...I don't know how to say this

125
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:41,525
Illinoians? Illinoisians?

126
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:44,815
who are members of the State's five pension systems

127
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:46,676
so this is the teacher's retirement system

128
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:49,362
this is the state universities' retirement system

129
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,124
this is the state employees' retirement system

130
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,338
this is the state judges' retirement system

131
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:55,895
you see that there're a lot fewer judges than that

132
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:58,055
there's been many more teachers

133
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,483
many who have been in the state universities

134
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:02,525
and this right over here is the General Assembly

135
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:05,424
very few people who are in the Illinois State Assembly

136
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,750
and you can see kind of comparable salaries

137
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,834
this is the retirement benefit

138
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:10,607
not just the salaries

139
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,437
this is on average how much these folks

140
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:15,543
are getting once they retire on an annual basis

141
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,097
so you see that they're pretty reasonable

142
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:20,007
especially for the judges

143
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,374
although that they are a small fraction

144
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:25,268
but in all fairness this was promised to these people

145
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,164
they planned

146
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:28,610
they probably took lower compensation while they were working

147
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,424
with the expectation that they were going to get these benefits

148
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,443
once they retired

149
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:36,660
they probably stayed on their jobs longer

150
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,533
This is a way of retaining employees

151
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,358
because they knew they were going to get these benefits

152
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:43,584
So you can say these are really great benefits

153
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,806
but at the same time these people probably sacrificed other things

154
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,930
in order to get these benefits now

155
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,045
But it's a very hard question

156
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:52,399
when you look at this

157
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,661
You say these people

158
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,860
they've done service

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,489
they've put these expectations

160
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:58,310
but at the same time

161
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,674
this is really cutting in

162
00:07:00,674 --> 00:07:01,972
and this is just one thing I'm showing

163
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:05,415
It's really cutting in to very important areas of investment

164
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,159
for the entire state

165
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,857
So the whole reason of really just surfacing this

166
00:07:09,857 --> 00:07:11,709
whole pension issue is just to put this in

167
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,301
and hopefully people understand what these issues are

168
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,935
because that's the only way that fairly hard decisions

169
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,151
are going to have to be made

170
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:22,087
Decisions on cutting necessary investments

171
00:07:22,087 --> 00:07:24,499
or restructuring or who knows what it may be

172
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:28,499
I don't envy the people who have to make these decisions
