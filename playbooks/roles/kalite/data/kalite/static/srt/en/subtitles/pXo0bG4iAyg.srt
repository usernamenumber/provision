1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
   

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,520
In this video I want to
introduce you to the idea of a

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,245
geometric sequence.

4
00:00:05,245 --> 00:00:09,590
   

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,720
And I have a ton of more
advanced videos on the topic,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,330
but it's really a good place to
start, just to understand

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,380
what we're talking about
when someone tells

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,450
you a geometric sequence.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,200
Now a good starting point is
just, what is a sequence?

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,330
And a sequence is, you
can imagine, just a

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,420
progression of numbers.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,730
So for example, and this isn't
even a geometric series, if I

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,570
just said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,120
This is a sequence of numbers.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,680
It's not a geometric sequence,
but it is a sequence.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,085
A geometric sequence is a
special progression, or a

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:52,370
special sequence, of numbers,
where each successive number

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,180
is a fixed multiple of
the number before it.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,080
Let me explain what
I'm saying.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,430
So let's say my first number is
2 and then I multiply 2 by

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,290
the number 3.

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,420
So I multiply it
by 3, I get 6.

23
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,590
And then I multiply 6 times the
number 3, and I get 18.

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,230
Then I multiply 18 times the
number 3, and I get 54.

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,280
And I just keep going
that way.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,090
So I just keep multiplying
by the number 3.

27
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,860
So I started, if we want to get
some notation here, this

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,970
is my first term.

29
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,840
We'll call it a1 for
my sequence.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,170
And each time I'm multiplying
it by a common number, and

31
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,140
that number is often called
the common ratio.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,420
So in this case, a1 is equal to
2, and my common ratio is

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,670
equal to 3.

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:49,760
   

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,680
So if someone were to tell
you, hey, you've got a

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,310
geometric sequence.

37
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,220
a1 is equal to 90 and your
common ratio is equal to

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,160
negative 1/3.

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,570
That means that the first term
of your sequence is 90.

40
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,770
The second term is negative
1/3 times 90.

41
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,759
Which is what?

42
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,160
That's negative 30, right?

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,340
1/3 times 90 is 30, and then you
put the negative number.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,000
Then the next number is going
to be 1/3 times this.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,930
So negative 1/3 times this.

46
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,790
1/3 times 30 is 10.

47
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,790
The negatives cancel out,
so you get positive 10.

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,650
Then the next number is going
to be 10 times negative 1/3,

49
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,250
or negative 10/3.

50
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,500
And then the next number is
going to be negative 10/3

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,950
times negative 1/3 so it's going
to be positive 10/3.

52
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,950
And you could just keep going
on with this sequence.

53
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,040
So that's what people talk
about when they mean a

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
geometric sequence.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,880
I want to make one little
distinction here.

56
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,280
This always used to confuse me
because the terms are used

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,940
very often in the
same context.

58
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,980
These are sequences.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,860
These are kind of a progression
of numbers.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,330
2, then 6, then 18, 90, then
negative 30, then 10, then

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,030
negative 10/3.

62
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,150
Then, I'm sorry, this is
positive 10/9, right?

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,500
Negative 1/3 times negative
10/3, negatives cancel out.

64
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,760
Right.

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,550
10/9.

66
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,830
Don't want to make
a mistake here.

67
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,350
These are sequences.

68
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,725
You might also see the
word a series.

69
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:24,840
   

70
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,180
And you might even see
a geometric series.

71
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,360
A series, the most conventional
use of the word

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,410
series, means a sum
of a sequence.

73
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,850
So for example, this is
a geometric sequence.

74
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:49,070
A geometric series would be 90
plus negative 30, plus 10,

75
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,500
plus negative 10/3, plus 10/9.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,660
So a general way to view
it is that a series is

77
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,910
the sum of a sequence.

78
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,470
I just want to make that clear
because that used to confuse

79
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,690
me a lot when I first learned
about these things.

80
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,550
But anyway, let's go back to
the notion of a geometric

81
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,240
sequence, and actually do a word
problem that deals with

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
one of these.

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,959
So they're telling us that Anne
goes bungee jumping off

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,599
of a bridge above water.

85
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:30,570
   

86
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,690
On the initial jump, the cord
stretches by 120 feet.

87
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,750
So on a1, our initial
jump, the cord

88
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,260
stretches by 120 feet.

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,510
We could write it this way.

90
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,100
   

91
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,865
We could write, jump, and then
how much the cord stretches.

92
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:56,330
   

93
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,370
So on the initial jump,
on jump one, the cord

94
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,870
stretches 120 feet.

95
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,420
Then it says, on the next
bounce, the stretch is 60% of

96
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,910
the original jump, and then
each additional bounce

97
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,230
stretches the rope 60% of
the previous stretch.

98
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,280
So here, the common ratio, where
each successive term in

99
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,400
our sequence is going to be
60% of the previous term.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,680
Or it's going to be 0.6 times
the previous term.

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,400
So on the second jump, we're
going to start 60% of that, or

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,220
0.6 times 120.

103
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,180
Which is equal to what?

104
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,960
That's equal to 72.

105
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,210
Then on the third jump, we're
going to stretch 0.6 of 72, or

106
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,470
0.6 times this.

107
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:49,900
So it would be 0.6 times
0.6 times 120.

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,410
Notice, over here, so on the
fourth jump we're going to

109
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:03,770
have 0.6 times 0.6 times
0.6 times 120.

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,810
60% of this jump, so every
time we're 60% of

111
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,030
the previous jump.

112
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,060
So if we wanted to make a
general formula for this, just

113
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,690
based on the way we've defined
it right here.

114
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:25,960
So the stretch on the nth
jump, what would it be?

115
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:39,900
So let's see, we start at 120
times 0.6 to the what?

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,570
To the n minus 1.

117
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,330
How did I get this?

118
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,410
Let me write this a
little bit here.

119
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,620
So this is equal to 0.6,
actually let me write the 120

120
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:59,500
first. This is equal to 120
times 0.6 to the n minus 1.

121
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,540
How did I get that?

122
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,610
Well we're defining the first
jump as stretching 120 feet.

123
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,880
So when you put n is equal to 1
here, you get 1 minus 1, 0.

124
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,995
So you have 0.6 to the
0th power, and you've

125
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:13,360
just got a 1 here.

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,920
And that's exactly what happened
on the first jump.

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,360
Then on the second jump, you put
a 2 minus 1, and notice 2

128
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,050
minus 1 is the first
power, and we have

129
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,900
exactly one 0.6 here.

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,620
So I figured it was n minus 1
because when n is 2, we have

131
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,560
one 0.6, when n is 3, we have
two 0.6's multiplied by

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,040
themselves.

133
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,120
When n is 4, we have 0.6
to the third power.

134
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,510
So whatever n is, we're taking
0.6 to the n minus 1 power,

135
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,940
and of course we're multiplying
that times 120.

136
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,340
Now and the question they also
ask us, what will be the rope

137
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,390
stretch on the 12th bounce?

138
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:00,790
And over here I'm going
to use the calculator.

139
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,600
and actually let me correct
this a little bit.

140
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,550
This isn't incorrect, but
they're talking about the

141
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,150
bounce, and we could call the
jump the zeroth bounce.

142
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,190
Let me change that.

143
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,150
This isn't wrong, but I think
this is where they're going

144
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,340
with the problem.

145
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,300
So you can view the initial
stretch as the zeroth bounce.

146
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,050
So instead of labeling it jump,
let me label it bounce.

147
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,049
So the initial stretch is the
zeroth bounce, then this would

148
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,960
be the first bounce, the second

149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,950
bounce, the third bounce.

150
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,960
And then our formula becomes
a lot simpler.

151
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:48,150
Because if you said the stretch
on nth bounce, then

152
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:57,180
the formula just becomes 0.6
to the n times 120, right?

153
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,740
On the zeroth bounce, that was
our original stretch, you get

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,660
0.6 to the 0, that's
1 times 120.

155
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,210
On the first bounce, 0.6 to
the 1, one 0.6 right here.

156
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,860
0.6 times the previous
stretch, or

157
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,350
the previous bounce.

158
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,390
So this has it in terms of
bounces, which I think is what

159
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,690
the questioner wants us to do.

160
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,940
So what about the 12th bounce?

161
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,500
Using this convention
right there.

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,240
So if we do the 12th bounce,
let's just get

163
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,930
our calculator out.

164
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:41,790
We're going to have 120 times
0.6 to the 12th power.

165
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,250
And hopefully we'll get order
of operations right, because

166
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,390
exponents take precedence over
multiplication, so it'll just

167
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,290
take the 0.6 to the
12th power only.

168
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:57,930
And so this is equal
to 0.26 feet.

169
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,990
So after your 12th bounce,
she's going

170
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,980
to be barely moving.

171
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,450
She's going to be moving about
3 inches on that 12th bounce.

172
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,760
Well, hopefully you found
this helpful.

173
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,360
And I apologize for the slight
divergence here, but I

174
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,420
actually think on some level
that's instructive.

175
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,750
Because you always have to make
sure that your n matches

176
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,740
well with what your
results are.

177
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,080
So when I talked about
your first jump, I

178
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,730
said, OK this is 1.

179
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,686
And then I had 0.6 to
the zeroth power, so

180
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:24,850
I did n minus 1.

181
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,370
But then when I relabeled things
in terms of bounces,

182
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,070
this was the zeroth bounce.

183
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,960
This makes sense that this is
0.6 to the zeroth power.

184
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,000
This is the first bounce,
so this would be 0.6

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,500
to the first power.

186
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,250
Second bounce, 0.6 to
the second power.

187
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,190
It made our equation a
little bit simpler.

188
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,730
Anyway, hopefully you found
that Interesting.

189
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:44,733
