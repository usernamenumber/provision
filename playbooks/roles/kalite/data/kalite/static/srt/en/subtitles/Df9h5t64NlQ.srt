1
00:00:00,613 --> 00:00:03,566
What we're going to do in this video are some real quick tests to see if

2
00:00:03,566 --> 00:00:07,298
these three random numbers are divisible by any of these numbers here

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,528
now I'm not going to focus a lot on the "why" of why they're divisible

4
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:15,961
but rather just to give you a sense of how do you actually test to see this is divisible by two

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:18,625
or five or nine, or ten.

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,513
so let's get started

7
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:22,440
so to test whether any of these are really divisible by two,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,810
you really just gotta look at the ones place

9
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,092
and see if the ones place is divisible by 2

10
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:30,973
and right over here, it is divisible by two,

11
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:34,027
so this thing is gonna be divisible by two

12
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:36,173
Zero is considered to be divisible by two

13
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:38,987
so this is going to be divisible by two.

14
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:40,119
Another way to think about it is

15
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,226
is if you have an even number over here,

16
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:43,490
and Zero is considered an even number,

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,877
then you're going to be divisible by two.

18
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,057
So over here,

19
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:49,794
Do not have a number that is divisible by two

20
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:53,639
this is five, so this is not divisible by two

21
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:54,811
so I won't write any two there.

22
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,823
we've gone through the twos,

23
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,156
now let's go through the threes.

24
00:00:59,156 --> 00:01:01,505
so to figure out if you are divisible by three,

25
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:03,408
you really just have to add up the digits

26
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,888
and figure out if the sum is divisible

27
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,309
by three.

28
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:10,520
Do that. So if I do 2 + 7 + 9

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,061
actually let me just write it out. +9 + 5

30
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,526
+8 +8. What's this going to be?

31
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:22,910
2 + 7 is 9, 9 + 9 is 18, + 9 is

32
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,888
27, + 5 is 32,

33
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:31,506
+ 8 is 40, + 8 is 48

34
00:01:31,506 --> 00:01:34,292
and 48 is divisible by three,

35
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:35,220
but in case you're not sure,

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,587
since this is equal to 48, in case you're not sure

37
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:38,878
whether this is divisible by 3,

38
00:01:38,878 --> 00:01:40,920
you can just add these digits up again.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,788
So 4 + 8

40
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:45,389
is equal to 12, and 12 clearly

41
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,812
is divisible by 3.

42
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,114
And if you're not even sure there,

43
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:50,010
you can add those digits up.

44
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,473
1 + 2 is equal to 3.

45
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,537
So this is divisible by 3.

46
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,129
This right over here, let's add up the digits!

47
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:01,962
5 + 6 = 11

48
00:02:01,962 --> 00:02:06,490
11 + 7 = 18, + 0 is 18

49
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,828
and if you want to add the 1 + 8 in 18,

50
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:10,628
you get 9

51
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,296
so the digits add up to 9.

52
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:19,868
So these add up to nine.

53
00:02:19,868 --> 00:02:23,479
They add to 18, which is clearly divisible by 3,

54
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,023
and these two things will add up to 9.

55
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,724
So the important thing to know, is that when you add up all the digits, the sum

56
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:30,654
is divisible by three

57
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:36,914
So this is divisible by three, as well.

58
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:37,991
Let's add up these digits.

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:42,428
1 + 0 + 0 + 7 =8, + 6 = 14

60
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:47,545
+ 5 = 19

61
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:50,406
So 19 is not

62
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:54,695
divisible by 3. So this one we're not gonna write a three by there.

63
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,646
It's not divisible by 3.

64
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,346
Let's try 4.

65
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,948
Think about four, you just have to think about the last 2 digits,

66
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,264
To see are the last 2 digits

67
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:07,825
divisible by four.

68
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,159
Immediately, you could look at this one over here,

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,046
see it's an odd number,

70
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:13,389
if it's not divisible by 2, it's definitely not going to be

71
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:14,412
divisible by four.

72
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:17,930
This one is not divisible by any of the first four numbers

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,845
88. Is that divisible by 4?

74
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:26,111
You can do that in your head. That's 4 x 22!

75
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:30,662
So this is divisible by 4.

76
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:34,447
Now let's see, 4 goes into 60 15 times

77
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,464
and then to go from 60 to 70 you have to go another 10,

78
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:40,075
so it's not divisible by four.

79
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,794
You could even try to divide it out yourself.

80
00:03:41,794 --> 00:03:47,458
Four goes into 70, 1 time, subtract get 30,

81
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:55,758
7 times, multiply, subtract, get a 2 over here as your remainder.

82
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:59,448
So it is not divisible by 4,

83
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,016
Now let's move on to five.

84
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,246
And you are probably already very familiar with this,

85
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,979
if your final digit is a 5 or 0, you are divisible by five.

86
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,029
So this one's not divisible by 5.

87
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:17,430
This one is divisible by 5.

88
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,850
And this you have a 5, as your ones digit, so finally this is divisible by something,

89
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,511
it's divisible by 5.

90
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:30,248
Now the number 6. The simple way to think about divisibility by 6

91
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:33,059
is that you have to be divisible by both 2 and 3,

92
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,344
to be divisible by 6, because

93
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,748
the prime factorization of 6 is

94
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:42,066
2 times 3. So here we're divisible by 2 and 3, so

95
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:47,481
we're going to be divisible by 6.

96
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:51,464
Here we're divisible by 2 and 3, so we're divisible by 6!

97
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:52,597
And if you were just divisible by only a 2

98
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,909
or a 3, you wouldn't be able to do this

99
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:58,597
you have to have both 2 and 3

100
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,697
and here you're divisible by neither 2 or 3,

101
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:05,475
so you're not going to be divisible by 6.

102
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:08,494
Now let's do the test for 9.

103
00:05:08,494 --> 00:05:09,767
The test for 9 is very similar to the test for 3

104
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,541
Sum up all the digits. If the sum is divisible by 9,

105
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,929
then you're there.

106
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:15,998
We already summed up the digits here,

107
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:18,745
48 is not divisible by 9,

108
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:21,365
if you're not sure, you can add up the digits there and get 12,

109
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:24,846
12 is definitely not divisible by 9.

110
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,348
So this thing right over here is not divisible by 9.

111
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:31,412
This one over here we added up all the digits and got 18,

112
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:36,520
18 is divisible by 9.

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,682
So this one is divisible by 9.

114
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,160
And this one over here, you don't even have to add them up,

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,919
because we already know it's not divisible by 3,

116
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,315
if it's not divisible by 3, it can't be divisible by 9

117
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,134
but if you did add up the digits, you'd get 19

118
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,166
which is not divisible by 9.

119
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,899
So this also is not divisible by 9.

120
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,834
And finally, divisibility by 10.

121
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,386
And this is the easiest one of all.

122
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,815
Cause you just have to see if you have a zero

123
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:04,160
in the ones place.

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,901
You clearly do not have a zero in the ones place here.

125
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,650
You do have a zero in the ones place here.

126
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,676
So you are divisible by 10 here,

127
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:14,980
are then finally you don't have a zero in the ones place

128
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,314
here, so you're not going to be divisible by 10.

129
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,268
Another way you could think about it,

130
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,293
you have to be divisible by both 2 and 5

131
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,167
to be divisible by 10.

132
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:26,698
Here you are divisible by 5, but not 2.

133
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:28,563
Obviously the easiest way is just to see if you have

134
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:32,563
a zero in the ones place.
