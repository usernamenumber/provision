1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,350
Solve the system of equations
using any method.

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,930
We have y is equal to 2 times
the quantity x minus 4

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,700
squared plus 3.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,960
We also have y is equal
to negative x squared

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,460
plus 2 x minus 2.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,470
The solution-- it might be one,
it might be none, or it

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,580
might be two solutions-- to this
system occurs for the x

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,640
values that generate
the same y values.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,570
There's the same x and
y that satisfy

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,870
both of these equations.

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,910
In order to find the x values,
they need to equal the same y

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,030
values, so this y has
to be that y value.

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,060
So the solution is going to
occur when this guy right

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:45,080
here-- negative x squared plus
2x minus 2 is equal to that

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,780
guy up there, or equal
to 2 times x minus 4

17
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,690
squared plus 3.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,120
Now let's just try
to solve for x.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,980
The left hand side-- we're going
to have to multiply this

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,040
out, so let's do that first.
It's negative x squared plus

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,530
2x minus 2 is equal to.

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,110
And on the right hand side, 2
times x minus 4 squared is x

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,455
squared minus 8x
plus 16 plus 3.

24
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,980
This is going to be equal
to 2x squared-- I'm just

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:27,680
distributing the 2-- minus 16x
plus 32 plus 3, which is equal

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,960
to 2x squared minus
16x plus 35.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,930
That's, of course, going to be
equal to this thing on the

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,050
left hand side, negative x
squared plus 2x minus 2.

29
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:46,510
   

30
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,040
Let's just get rid of this whole
thing from the left hand

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,600
side all at once by adding
x squared to both sides.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
We can all do it in one step.

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,340
We're going to add x squared
to both sides.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,040
Let's subtract 2x from
both sides, and let's

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,450
add 2 to both sides.

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,000
   

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,310
On the left hand side, those
cancel out, those cancel out,

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,095
those cancel out.

39
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:15,430
You're left with 0 is equal to
2x squared plus x squared is

40
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,390
3x squared.

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,940
Negative 16x minus 2x is
negative 18x, and then

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,500
35 plus 2 is 37.

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,060
So we just have a plain vanilla
quadratic equation

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,220
right here.

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,510
We might as well apply the
quadratic formula here to try

46
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,920
to solve it.

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,000
Our solutions are going to be
x is equal to negative b.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,860
Well, b is negative 18, so
negative b is positive 18.

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,960
It's 18 plus or minus the square
root of 18 squared

50
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,990
minus 4 times 3 times
c-- times 37.

51
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,290
All of that is over 2 times
a-- 2 times 3, which is 6.

52
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,400
Let's think about what
this is going to be.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,680
Over here, we have 18 plus or
minus the square root of--

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,220
let's just use a calculator.

55
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,860
I could multiply it out but I
think-- we have 18 squared

56
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:28,170
minus 4 times 3 times 37,
which is negative 120.

57
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,760
It's 18 plus or minus the square
root of negative 120.

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,820
You might have even been
able to figure out

59
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,770
that this is negative.

60
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,030
4 times 3 is 12.

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,460
12 times 37 is going to be
a bigger number than 18.

62
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,850
Although it's not 100% obvious,
but you might be able

63
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,170
to just get the intuition
there.

64
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,290
We definitely end up with a
negative number under the

65
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,440
radical here.

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,950
Now, if we're dealing with
real numbers, there is no

67
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,000
square root of negative 120.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,850
So there is no solution to
this quadratic equation.

69
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,030
There is no solution.

70
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,500
If we wanted to, we could
have just looked at the

71
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,100
discriminant.

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,660
The discriminant is this part--
b squared minus 4ac.

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,960
We see the discriminant is
negative, there's no solution,

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,350
which means that these two
guys-- these two equations--

75
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,410
never intersect.

76
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:20,310
There is no solution
to the system.

77
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,060
There are no x values that
when you put into both of

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,860
these equations give you
the exact same y value.

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,460
Let's think a little bit about
why that happened.

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,280
This one is already in kind
of our y-intercept form.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,070
It's an upward opening
parabola, so it looks

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,240
something like this.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,370
I'll do my best to draw
it-- just a quick and

84
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,990
dirty version of it.

85
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,670
Let me draw my axes in
a neutral color.

86
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,930
Let's say that this right here
is my y-axis, that right there

87
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,000
is my x-axis.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,130
x and y.

89
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,540
This vertex-- it's in the vertex
form-- occurs when x is

90
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,595
equal to 4 and y
is equal to 3.

91
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,490
So x is equal to 4 and
y is equal to 3.

92
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,010
It's an upward opening
parabola.

93
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,210
We have a positive coefficient
out here.

94
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,240
So this will look something
like this.

95
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,460
   

96
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,990
I don't know the exact thing,
but that's close enough.

97
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,960
Now, what will this
thing look like?

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,690
It's a downward opening parabola
and we can actually

99
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,910
put this in vertex form.

100
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,880
Let me put the second equation
in vertex form,

101
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,925
just so we have it.

102
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:25,010
So we have a good sense.

103
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,730
So, y is equal to-- we could
factor in a negative 1--

104
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,670
negative x squared
minus 2x plus 2.

105
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,200
   

106
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,210
Actually, let me put the plus
2 further out-- plus 2, all

107
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,080
the way up out there.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,390
Then we could say, half of
negative 2 is negative 1.

109
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,100
You square it, so you
have a plus 1 and

110
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,390
then a minus 1 there.

111
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,170
This part right over here, we
can rewrite as x minus 1

112
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,130
squared, so it becomes negative
x minus 1 squared.

113
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,715
Let me just do it one
step at a time.

114
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:06,100
I don't want to skip steps.

115
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,820
Negative x minus 1 squared
minus 1 plus 2.

116
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,250
So that's plus 1 out here.

117
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,060
Or if we want to distribute
the negative, we get y is

118
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,440
equal to negative x minus
1 squared minus 1.

119
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,030
Here the vertex occurs at x is
equal to 1, y is equal to

120
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,280
negative 1.

121
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,750
   

122
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,840
The vertex is there,
and this is a

123
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,350
downward opening parabola.

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,820
We have a negative coefficient
out here on the second degree

125
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,310
term, so it's going to look
something like this.

126
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,840
   

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,640
So as you see, they
don't intersect.

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,030
This vertex is above it
and it opens upward.

129
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,320
This is its minimum point.

130
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,610
And it's above this guy's
maximum point.

131
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,790
So they will never intersect,
so there is no solution to

132
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,710
this system of equations.

133
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,133
