1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,360
In a typical organic chemistry
problem set or exam, they'll

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,050
give you some type
of reaction.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,230
In this case, we have--
what is this molecule?

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,310
We have one, two, three,
four, five carbons.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,920
It is an alkene.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,640
It starts on the number two
carbon if we start numbering

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,430
from here, and the number
two carbon also

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,920
has a methyl group.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:27,990
So this is 2-methyl-pent-2-ene,
usually

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,220
naming it-- we don't have to
name it when we worry about

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,150
mechanisms. But they'll give
you a molecule like

13
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,320
2-methyl-pent-2-ene.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,210
They'll draw it out like this
and they'll draw a reaction.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,990
They're saying in the presence
of water and catalyzed by

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,360
hydronium ions, we end up with
this thing over here.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,580
And then they'll give you a
bunch of white space below it,

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,070
and they say how did
this happen?

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,520
Give us the mechanism.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
And that's what we're going
to do in this video.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,440
So let's start with this
molecule right there, the

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,295
2-methyl-pent-2-ene.

23
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:57,700
So let me draw it right here.

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,773
So we have double-bond carbon.

25
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,379
I have a hydrogen.

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,460
I have two carbons right over
here, and then I have a

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:16,780
carbon, H3C, and then-- and we
put H3 before the C just to

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,540
make it clear the carbon
is what's bonded

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,360
to the other carbon.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,370
That's why we don't write CH3,
but that wouldn't be

31
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,910
completely incorrect, and then
you have HC3 over here.

32
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,570
And then we're going
to have some

33
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,470
hydronium molecules around.

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,490
So let me draw a hydronium
molecule.

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,700
So it is an oxygen in
the middle and then

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,370
we have three hydrogens.

37
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,140
One, two, and three.

38
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,670
And oxygen also will have one
unbonded pair of electrons,

39
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,180
and it has a positive
charge here.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,100
And the reason why this has a
positive charge, if you think

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:05,050
about regular water, regular
water looks like this: six

42
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,250
valence electrons.

43
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,100
Let me do the valence electrons
in another color.

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,110
One, two, three, four,
five, and six.

45
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,770
The other half of these
bonds comes

46
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,240
from hydrogen's electrons.

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Now, in the case of a hydronium
molecule you have a

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
proton sitting out here.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,540
It has absolutely no electrons,
and to form the

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,130
bond, one of oxygen's unpaired
valence electrons go to the

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,260
hydrogen, and that's what
forms the bonds.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,620
You could imagine that that
electron is right over there.

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,900
That's why it has a
positive charge.

54
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,790
Now, oxygen wants that
electron back.

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,870
It doesn't like having this
positive charge, and we've

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,960
seen in the last videos that
sometimes the carbons, one of

57
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,760
the carbons in the double bond,
is pretty predisposed to

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,750
at least temporarily giving
up an electron.

59
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,760
And we saw that the one that's
most likely to give up an

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
electron is the one that's
bonded to the most carbons.

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,750
And in this case, this guy right
here is bonded to the

62
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,430
most carbons.

63
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,000
He's bonded to two carbons.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,710
This guy's only bonded to one.

65
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:20,060
He is a secondary, or if he
loses his electron, it will be

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,500
a secondary carbocation as
opposed to if this guy loses

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,000
his electron, it will be
a primary carbocation.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,860
This one will be more stable.

69
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,520
So what we can do is, we'll
say, look, this electron

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,260
that's at this end of this bond
right here, it goes to

71
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,570
the hydrogen right over there.

72
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,260
And then the electron that this
hydrogen was taking from

73
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,010
the oxygen will go back to the
oxygen, and it all kind of

74
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,550
happens simultaneously.

75
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,340
This electron is attracted, I
guess you could say, to the

76
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,980
partial positive charge, because
maybe this electron

77
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,640
spends more time over there.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,280
And then this electron
goes back to the

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,090
oxygen to make water.

80
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,430
So what happens after this end
of the reaction or this part

81
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,390
of the reaction happens?

82
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,840
So after that happens, we will--
let me clear out this

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,090
water, actually.

84
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,670
   

85
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,399
That's not essential to
our mechanism, to

86
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,579
our reaction mechanism.

87
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,970
So after that happens, what
will everything look like?

88
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,170
Well, we'll have our
basic molecule.

89
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:36,280
So we have a H3C, we have a
carbon, we have another H3C.

90
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,290
It is now a single bond to the
other carbon, which is bonded

91
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,590
to a hydrogen and two other
carbons, CH2-CH3.

92
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,115
Now, this guy has lost
his electron.

93
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,980
That electron went
to the hydrogen.

94
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:56,760
So this guy now is a positive
carbocation.

95
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,370
Carbocation by definition is
positive so maybe I'm being a

96
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,060
little redundant there.

97
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,030
So it's positive.

98
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,110
And then this bond-- let
me do this in orange.

99
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,560
This bond is now between this
carbon and the hydrogen.

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,510
The electron went to that
hydrogen to form a bond.

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:18,490
So this bond is now with this
hydrogen over here and then

102
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,410
this thing that was a hydronium
molecule will now be

103
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,660
just water.

104
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,580
   

105
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,700
So I'll draw it like this.

106
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,530
It got its electron back.

107
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,470
Let me draw its two electron
pairs, just like that.

108
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,470
And then it has two hydrogens.

109
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,690
It is H2O.

110
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:46,270
And you can imagine that maybe
that was one of the electrons

111
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,750
that was on oxygen end, and
then this was the electron

112
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,010
that it had given essentially to
the hydrogen, but it's now

113
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,690
giving back, and now they're
both back with the oxygen.

114
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,180
That's the one it always had
on its end, and this is the

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,540
one that it just got back
from the hydrogen.

116
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,280
Now, what do you think
will happen next?

117
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,970
Well, when you can just look at
the final products of this

118
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,500
reaction you say, well, at some
point, I have to have an

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,735
OH attached right over here, and
that's usually a good way

120
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:18,450
to figure out what's going
to happen next.

121
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,050
So somehow, it looks like
this might attach to

122
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,570
that positive charge.

123
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,610
It was attached to a positive
charge before.

124
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,620
It was attracted to that
hydrogen proton, so why can't

125
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,560
it do it with the carbocation?

126
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,890
And then once it does
that, maybe we lose

127
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,200
one of these hydrogens.

128
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,620
And actually this reaction-- I
shouldn't draw these strict

129
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,760
arrows here, because every
step of this reaction is

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,980
really-- there's some
form of equilibrium.

131
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,100
It doesn't only go
in one direction.

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,940
Things can go in both
directions here.

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,170
So let me clear this.

134
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,470
And let me show that these
aren't just one-way reactions.

135
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,420
They can go in both
directions.

136
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,340
But if we are trying to show a
mechanism, we're assuming that

137
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,150
we're going in the direction
that we're

138
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,800
drawing this out in.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,660
So in the next step, let's
making that oxygen attack that

140
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,760
carbocation.

141
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,020
Or another way, I guess a better
way, the carbocation is

142
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,870
attacking the oxygen.

143
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,320
It's going to take
back an electron.

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,100
So let's do that.

145
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,010
Let's make it-- lets draw it
taking back electron or an

146
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,140
electron being given back
to this carbocation.

147
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,060
So then we'll have, let's say,
that orange electron right

148
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,580
there-- let me do it in
a different color.

149
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,150
Let's say we have this.

150
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,450
That orange one is
attracted to the

151
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,850
carbocation and forms a bond.

152
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,970
Now, what's going to happen?

153
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,160
Let me draw it as an equilibrium
reaction.

154
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,010
   

155
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,880
But we're going to go in this
direction just to see how we

156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,260
can get that final
end product.

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,710
We have H3C.

158
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,470
We have the carbon that
was a carbocation.

159
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,810
We have H3C.

160
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,810
Now, we have the single bond to
a hydrogen to two carbons

161
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,210
right over here.

162
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,890
We have this business, that bond
that was formed in the

163
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,996
early part of our mechanism.

164
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,960
Let me draw that.

165
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,290
And then we have that blue
hydrogen there that helps us

166
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,740
keep track where things
came from.

167
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,110
And now this has attached.

168
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,750
We have gotten that orange
electron to the carbocation.

169
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,650
It will form a bond.

170
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,060
It's going to form a bond.

171
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,290
And what's that bond
going to look like?

172
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:30,990
Let me draw this oxygen
over here like that.

173
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,100
It has that electron pair
still all to itself.

174
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,350
It has the two hydrogens.

175
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,679
   

176
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,630
It had that green electron, but
now it's not just paired

177
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,480
up with this orange electron.

178
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,400
That orange electron went.

179
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,530
It left the oxygen and went
to that carbocation.

180
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,520
So now the orange electron
is right over there and

181
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,770
it formed this bond.

182
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,380
   

183
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,830
Now carbon has four
valence electrons.

184
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,770
This carbon has one, two, three,
four valence electons.

185
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,370
This oxygen just lost an
electron again and so it now

186
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,156
has a positive charge again.

187
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:16,560
   

188
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,850
Now, what do you think
will happen next?

189
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,000
We're very close to
the final product.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,430
The thing we have here looks
almost identical to the thing

191
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,630
that we have to end up at,
except we have a whole

192
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,170
hydronium group, I guess
you could say, or

193
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,230
actually a whole water.

194
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,570
We have H2O attached here.

195
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,990
They only have an OH.

196
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,660
And this oxygen right here,
it's a positive charge.

197
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,010
It wants to get one of
its electrons back.

198
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,840
It could take it back from here
or it could take it back

199
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,380
from one of these hydrogens.

200
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,240
And if it takes it back from one
of these hydrogens, then

201
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,190
we will be at our final
end product.

202
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,890
We will have a neutrally charged
OH group right there.

203
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,240
So how would that happen?

204
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,010
Well, we're in an aqueous
solution.

205
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,580
There is water all around us.

206
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,910
There are molecules of water,
so let me draw one of those

207
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:16,690
molecules of water that's just
floating around, and maybe one

208
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,640
of its electrons right here.

209
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,590
Let me color code it.

210
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,170
That makes it a little
bit more fun.

211
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:28,180
Maybe one of it's electrons are
attracted to the partial

212
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,570
positive end of this molecule
or this hydrogen.

213
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,900
So I'll do it in green.

214
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,270
It goes to this hydrogen.

215
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,740
This hydrogen no longer needs
this electron on this end of

216
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:50,400
the bond, and so it goes back
to the oxygen like that.

217
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,890
And then what is going
to happen?

218
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,320
What do we have left at that
end, or, in general, after

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,110
that part of the reaction
happens?

220
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,420
We have all of this
stuff over here.

221
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,000
Maybe I should just copy-- well,
let me just redraw it.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,490
So we have H3C, a carbon-carbon
single bond.

223
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,490
I'm going to draw everything in
yellow that we started off

224
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,430
with in yellow.

225
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:21,000
CH2-CH3, H3C, and then we have
that first hydrogen that got

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,130
attached on this end.

227
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,610
We figured out it was going
to be this end more likely

228
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,440
because of Markovnikov's rule.

229
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,890
One way to remember is this
carbocation was more stable.

230
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,970
The other way is the side that
has more hydrogens will get

231
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,520
more hydrogens.

232
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,390
The side that has more
functional groups will get

233
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,700
more functional groups.

234
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,290
But now we have all
of this business.

235
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:44,400
We have this magenta bond here,
and we have an oxygen in

236
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,710
the middle.

237
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,740
It is still bonded to that
hydrogen over there.

238
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,420
   

239
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,650
This pair of electrons, I'm
just going to do it on the

240
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,930
side, just so we can
draw it how we can

241
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,860
conventionally draw it.

242
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,920
And now we had-- and
let me make it very

243
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,260
clear with the colors.

244
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,890
We had this electron on one end
of a bond, so it's still

245
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,630
there on that end of the bond.

246
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,920
And then we have this electron
that was with the hydrogen,

247
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,860
but now it's gone back
to the oxygen.

248
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,630
   

249
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,380
So now we have two
pairs again.

250
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,180
We have six valence electrons
around the oxygen: one, two,

251
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,870
three, four, five, six.

252
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,880
It is neutral.

253
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,390
And now one of those water
molecules has become a

254
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,600
hydronium molecule.

255
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,010
So now that water
looks like this.

256
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,200
That thing that was a water
molecule looks like this.

257
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,750
It has its lone pair.

258
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,280
And then it has one end, that
electron right there, but this

259
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,486
blue electron went and
joined the hydrogen.

260
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:49,340
   

261
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,890
Let me draw it little closer to
the hydrogen right there.

262
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,190
And then it has that bond.

263
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,730
   

264
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,440
So when all is said and done,
we were able to get to the

265
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,690
molecule that the mechanism,
or that the reaction

266
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,420
described, and it was
actually the most

267
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,080
reasonable path to follow.

268
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,940
We followed Markovnikov's
rule.

269
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,940
We figured out that this was the
most stable carbocation,

270
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,740
and then we just added
the water.

271
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,260
This is an addition reaction of
water in the presence of an

272
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,160
acid, in the presence
of hydronium.

273
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Hopefully, you found that
vaguely useful.

274
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,534
