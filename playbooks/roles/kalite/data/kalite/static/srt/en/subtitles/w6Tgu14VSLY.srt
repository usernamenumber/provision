1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,565
The back of the Maesta is astonishing.

2
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:10,451
It's every bit as large as the front,

3
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,060
but has many, many more panels.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,669
But, Duccio isn't conceiving of each one enitrely separately.

5
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:17,150
He's thinking about how to unify all of these scenes together

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,815
and make them really legible for a viewer.

7
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,428
A great example of that is

8
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:24,352
if you look at the three central scenes.

9
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:26,932
At the bottom, you have Christ in the garden.

10
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:30,134
He's asking his Apostles to remain awake

11
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:33,011
while he has a private meditation with God.

12
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,716
But after the Apostles left, we see them a second time,

13
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:39,410
this time fast asleep, not having heeded his request at all.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,982
I do want to make note of the three central trees in that image.

15
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:46,059
Those trees are echoed in the image just above,

16
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,575
which is the arrest of Christ.

17
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:49,226
This is the betrayal,

18
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:50,252
and you can see Judas,

19
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:52,272
who has already been paid pieces of silver

20
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:55,166
by the Roman authorities to identify Christ with a kiss.

21
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,132
You see Christ being abandoned by his followers,

22
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:00,300
or most of them, who flee.

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,016
But, Peter comes to his rescue,

24
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:03,917
and on the left side you can see

25
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,544
Peter actually taking out his knife

26
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:08,001
and slicing off the ear of one of the soldiers.

27
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,019
So, we have a continuous narrative in both of those panels.

28
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:12,439
We do, especially

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,039
since we see those trees sort of a second time.

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,940
And, they are echoed in both scenes.

31
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,752
But, what's most interesting, I think, is

32
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:20,644
if you go one more step up,

33
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,624
you see a double height scene,

34
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,152
and this is the Crucifixion.

35
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,342
Now, of course, the Crucifixion is incredibly important,

36
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:28,844
and so, is given much more room.

37
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:32,068
But, those three trees, now, have become three crosses.

38
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,171
So, Duccio's thinking about ways that

39
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,526
he can visually bring the scenes together,

40
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,961
uniting formal elements between the panels.

41
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:44,586
Let's take a look at the first double panel.

42
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,673
You might think about it

43
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,303
the way that an illuminated manuscript

44
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:50,651
will sometimes have a large opening captial letter.

45
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,450
It gives us the idea of where to begin. That's right.

46
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,096
This is the entry of Christ into Jerusalem,

47
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:00,129
and we see Christ entering rather humbly

48
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:02,450
into the gates of Jerusalem.

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,827
And we can identify Christ

50
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:05,723
because he's larger than the other figures

51
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,244
and there's a halo.

52
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:08,804
He's riding in on a donkey.

53
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:12,689
All the elements that are delineated in the Gospels are here.

54
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,197
You have people in the trees,

55
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,930
you have people laying down cloth before him

56
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,716
and can see his Apostles following behind him,

57
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:21,952
and the people of the city literally

58
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,228
pouring out of the gates.

59
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,004
In order to give us a sense of a real crowd

60
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,475
coming to see Christ,

61
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:31,112
you'll notice that there's actually a reverse perspective

62
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,363
because the figures in the back are

63
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,918
larger than the figures in the foreground and also higher,

64
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:39,916
which would not be the case in correct perspective.

65
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,950
But, Duccio's given this wonderful impression of

66
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,315
a real crowd of people present

67
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:48,270
to see Christ and his followers entering Jerusalem.

68
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,808
There does seem to be a love of architecture

69
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:53,758
and the rendering of architecture,

70
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,333
almost for its own sake.

71
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,383
And look at those beautiful lancet windows.

72
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:01,072
And it's this interesting combination of architecture

73
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:04,136
and a space for the figures to occupy,

74
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:06,549
but then, also this gold background

75
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,827
that indicates the heavenly and the spiritual.

76
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:11,666
So, this mixture of both.

77
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:13,282
You mention the gold background,

78
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:15,552
and as you look across not just this panel,

79
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,828
but all of the panels on the back of the Maesta,

80
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,832
not to mention the panels on front of the Maesta,

81
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,817
there is just an enormous amount of gold.

82
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:24,501
It is literally a treasure,

83
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:27,922
and one can only imagine what it would've looked like

84
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:32,371
in the stark white and black marble space of the Cathedral.

85
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:35,618
Unfortunately, this painting was taken off of the altar

86
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:38,515
and was ultimately, in the 18th century,

87
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,820
cut up for private purchase.

88
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,698
This was a moment when the so-called Italian primitives

89
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:46,285
became sought after by some collectors.

90
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,100
The result is we don't have all of the paintings in Siena,

91
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,770
but many of them are scattered

92
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,162
in museums around the world.

93
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,971
There is one panel, for example,

94
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:55,177
at the Frick Collection,

95
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,457
and it would be lovely

96
00:03:56,457 --> 00:04:00,409
to understand these paintings in one place.
