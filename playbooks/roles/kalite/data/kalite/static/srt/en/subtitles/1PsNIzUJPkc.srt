1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,770
Let's say I have some linear
transformation

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,870
T from R2 to R2.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,700
So that is R2, and
then this is R2.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,770
T just maps from any member of
R2 to another member of R2,

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,020
just like that.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,240
And I'm going to define T.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,400
It's a linear transformation.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,980
I'm going to define it.

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,110
When I take the transformation
of some member of R2, it's

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,820
equivalent to multiplying it by
this matrix, by the matrix

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,560
1 minus 3, minus 1, 3.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,610
So just to kind of understand
this transformation a little

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,790
bit more, let's think about all
of the values that it can

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,360
take on in our codomain.

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,970
   

17
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,720
So if we say that 1 minus 3,
minus 1, 3, times any vector

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,390
in our domain-- so x1, x2-- it's
going to be equal to some

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,580
other vector in our codomain.

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,860
Let me call that vector b.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,795
B is a member of R2.

22
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:02,360
So it's going to be
equal to b1, b2.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,250
All I'm doing here is I'm
essentially-- if I call this

24
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,200
right here, I call that matrix
A-- I'm just trying to find

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,080
out what are all the possible
values for Ax is equal to b?

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,980
I'm trying to find out all of
the possible b's in this case.

27
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,040
   

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,330
So if I were to solve this
equation for any particular b,

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,810
what I would do is I
would put this in

30
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,600
reduced row echelon form.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,290
Well, first I would make an
augmented matrix of it.

32
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,700
So I would put a 1, a minus
3, a minus 1, and a 3.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,250
And I would augment it with
the member of our codomain

34
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,320
we're trying to be equal to.

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,720
So b1, b2.

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,140
And then, I would put it in
reduced row echelon form.

37
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,670
So how can we do that?

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,800
How can we put it in reduced
row echelon form?

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,420
I'll keep my first
row the same.

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,630
1 minus 3, and then b1.

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,350
And then my second row, I'll
replace it with my second row

42
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,820
plus my first row.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,730
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

44
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,440
3 plus minus 3 is 0.

45
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,259
And then b2 plus b1 is--
well I can just write

46
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:14,170
that as b1 plus b2.

47
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,080
So this is only going
to have solutions.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,560
I have an interesting
situation here.

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,540
You've seen it before.

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,790
I have a row of 0's.

51
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,310
   

52
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,140
And the only way that this
is going to actually have

53
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,160
solutions is if this thing right
here is also going to be

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,370
equal to 0.

55
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:45,420
So the only members b that are
members of Rm that have

56
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,730
solutions are the ones where
if you add up their two

57
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,560
terms-- so let's say b is equal
to b1 and b2-- are the

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,080
ones where the two terms added
up have to be to 0.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,850
b1 plus b2 have to
be equal to 0.

60
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,990
Or another way you could write
it is that b2 has to be equal

61
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,410
to minus b1.

62
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,680
So if we were to actually draw
our codomain-- let's do it.

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,650
We always stay in the abstract,
but sometimes it's

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,640
useful to draw an
actual example.

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,850
Let's say that our
codomain is R2.

66
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,280
Let me draw some axes
right here.

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,010
Let's say that this
is my b1-axis,

68
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,830
and this is my b2-axis.

69
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,380
I could have called that
x and y, but I

70
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,900
called that b1 and b2.

71
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,820
What are all of the members
of my codomain that have a

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,000
solution, that have a mapping?

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,390
Well, b2 has to be equal
to minus b1.

74
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,900
So it's going to
look like this.

75
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,960
   

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,860
It's just going to be a line
with a slope of negative 1.

77
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,650
This is all the b's that
have a solution.

78
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,000
   

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,950
Because if you're not
on this line.

80
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,110
If you're a member of your
codomain-- this is the

81
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,040
codomain right here, R2.

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
R2 is also our domain, but let
me make it very clear that

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,850
this is the codomain
that I've drawn.

84
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,890
This is what we're
mapping into.

85
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,170
It's very clear that if we're
not on this line, if you pick

86
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,440
somebody whose two terms don't
add up to equalling 0, or

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,840
aren't the negative of each
other, if you pick someone

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,760
over here in our codomain, and
then you try to solve the

89
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,780
equation over here, 0 is going
to equal some non-zero number

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,750
here and you're not going
to have a solution.

91
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,930
And we touched on this
in the last video.

92
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,250
And so in this case we could
say that this right here is

93
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,773
the image of our
transformation.

94
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:51,720
   

95
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
Or even another way of
thinking about it.

96
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,520
   

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,440
This is our codomain.

98
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,690
Let me draw a domain.

99
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,430
   

100
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,920
So if you take any member of
R2, and it's always mapping

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,820
onto something onto that line,
clearly each point on that

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,050
line is going to be mapped to
by more than one vector.

103
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,840
So we're not dealing with
an onto transformation.

104
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,420
We saw that in the last video.

105
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,460
In order for something to be
onto, when you put it in

106
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,750
reduced row echelon form,
you cannot have all 0's

107
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,380
in one of the rows.

108
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,800
Or another way to say it in
reduced row echelon form,

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,820
every row has to have
a pivot entry.

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,990
Well, let's focus
on the b's that

111
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,460
actually do have a solution.

112
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,190
So let's focus on these b's,
so that when you take a b1

113
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,530
plus b2, it actually is going
to be equal to 0.

114
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,790
So we could have the b, I don't
know, that could be the

115
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:55,260
b5 minus 5.

116
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,120
Obviously the b0, 0
is going to work.

117
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
You could have 1, negative 1.

118
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,820
Maybe that's right there.

119
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's focus on those for a
second and see how many

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,030
members of our domain
map into them.

121
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,390
So if we take this right here
and then we apply this

122
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,960
equation up here, we only
have one constraint.

123
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,650
We're assuming that this is
going to be equal to 0.

124
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,340
So let's assume that
we're dealing with

125
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,050
the b's in our image.

126
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,890
Let's assume that we're dealing
with something where

127
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,920
we can get a solution.

128
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,890
That b1 plus b2 is equal to 0.

129
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,210
Then what is our constraints?

130
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,090
What will map to our vector
b that we're dealing with?

131
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,710
If we just take this topic
equation right here, we have 1

132
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:53,000
times x1-- let me switch
colors-- minus 3 times x2 is

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,190
equal to b1.

134
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,610
And then this row will give us
no constraints, because it's

135
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,900
just going to be
a bunch of 0's.

136
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,240
So this is the only constraint
for a member of our domain

137
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,770
that will map to some particular
b now that we are

138
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,750
picking, some particular
b that satisfies this

139
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,560
constraint.

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,820
So we could write this solution
set-- let me rewrite

141
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,110
it as x1 is equal
to b1, plus 3x2.

142
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,890
Or if we wanted to write the
entire solution set, it would

143
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,280
look like this.

144
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:39,960
x1, x2 is equal to the vector
b1, 0, plus-- x1 is b1, plus

145
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,440
3, times x2, so plus
x2 times 3.

146
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,910
And x2 is just going
to be equal to x2.

147
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,260
That's a free variable.

148
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,910
So x2 is equal to 0
plus x2, times 1.

149
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,820
So what we're saying here is
this transformation just maps

150
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,400
to this line here for all of the
vectors in our codomain,

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,770
where their two entries
add up to each other.

152
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,850
Let's assume that we actually
have one of those vectors.

153
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,440
And so first of all, this is
definitely not an onto

154
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,160
transformation.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,710
But let's assume that
we are dealing with

156
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,580
one of those guys.

157
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,660
So if we are picking a
particular one of those guys

158
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:23,540
for a particular b-- let me
write this down-- that has a

159
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:42,559
solution to Ax is equal to b,
the solution set will be equal

160
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,690
to this thing right here.

161
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,100
It'll be equal to x1, x2
is equal to the first

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,200
entry of your b.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,020
b1, 0 plus x2, times
the vector 3,1.

164
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,780
And if you think about this, if
you pick a particular b--

165
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,610
so let's say we pick our-- let
me draw this out, because I

166
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,450
think it's nice to
visualize it all.

167
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,380
Actually, maybe I'll
draw it like this.

168
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,250
I don't want to draw
our blobs anymore.

169
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,250
So let me draw my axes.

170
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,980
So my axes look like this.

171
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,070
We know that the image of our
transformation is the line

172
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,710
with a negative 1 slope, because
the two entries have

173
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,510
to be equal to the negative
of each other.

174
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,120
Let's pick a particular
b that has a solution.

175
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,550
So let's say we pick
that b right there.

176
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,710
In order for it to have a
solution, its entries have to

177
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,830
be the negative of each other.

178
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:38,480
So let's say that's the
entry 5, minus 5.

179
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,660
That is our b.

180
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,245
So what we just showed is that
the solution set, if we want

181
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:47,060
to say, hey, what in our domain
maps to this guy?

182
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,210
So let's think about what
in our domain maps

183
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,460
to this right here.

184
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,880
   

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,780
Let's think about what in our
domain maps to this point

186
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,680
right here, to this
particular b.

187
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,940
So that's going to be all of
the x's that satisfy Ax is

188
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,425
equal to 5, minus 5.

189
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:13,050
   

190
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:19,230
So x1, x2 is going to be equal
to b1, it's going to be equal

191
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,910
to 5, 0 plus x2, plus any
scale or multiple of the

192
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,420
vector 3, 1.

193
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,780
So our solution set is going to
be, you take the vector 5,

194
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,430
0-- so maybe the vector 5, 0,
specifies this position right

195
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,420
here-- and then you're going to
add to it multiples of the

196
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,320
vector 3, 1.

197
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,770
The vector 3, 1 looks like this,
1, 2, 3 and you go up 1.

198
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,980
The vector 3, 1 is going
to look like this.

199
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,110
   

200
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,070
So if you add multiples of
this-- multiples of that could

201
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,610
stretch out like that or could
go negative like that-- to

202
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,440
this vector 5, 0, you're
essentially going to-- let me

203
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,140
see if I can draw this neatly--
you're going to end

204
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,090
up with a solution set that
looks like that right there.

205
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,820
So if you pick a particular
b right there that has a

206
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,240
solution, we just said that
everything on this line will

207
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,620
map to that point in
our solution set.

208
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,810
   

209
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,790
And in fact, if you picked
another point, let's say you

210
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,050
picked the point minus 5, 5.

211
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,800
   

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,700
Then the solution set that maps
to that would actually

213
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,960
be-- this first term would
be the minus 5.

214
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,940
It would be here.

215
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,680
And all of these guys
would map to that.

216
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,720
Well, this all interesting.

217
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I mean, we've been doing a
lot of abstract things.

218
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,110
And I think it might be
satisfying that you're

219
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,770
actually seeing something more
concrete in this example.

220
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,370
But I'm doing all of
this for a reason.

221
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,760
Because I want to understand
what the solution set is to a

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,750
general non-homogeneous
equation like this.

223
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,090
And to understand it a little
bit better, let's imagine what

224
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,670
is the solution set
if I were to pick

225
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,700
this guy, the 0 vector?

226
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,500
   

227
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,910
Then what's going to be
the solution set?

228
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,660
   

229
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,630
So if we say that Ax is equal to
0, then our solution set is

230
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:33,050
going to the vector 0, 0,
plus x2, times 3, 1.

231
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,350
So it's going to be what?

232
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,540
This is just the 0 vector,
so it's going to be here.

233
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,270
It's going to be here, and
it's going to just be

234
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,410
multiples of 3, 1.

235
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,690
   

236
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,020
It's going to look something
like that.

237
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,770
What's this?

238
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,470
What is the solution set to the
equation of Ax equal to 0.

239
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,560
This is the null space.

240
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,680
This, by definition, is
the null space of A.

241
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,150
   

242
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,880
So notice-- and this is the big
takeaway from this video--

243
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,630
that for any solution-- we're
picking b's that actually do

244
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,650
have solutions, because we're
picking them on this line.

245
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:16,320
We're picking them in the
image of our codomain.

246
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,280
The solution set to any Ax is
equal to some b where b does

247
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,800
have a solution, it's
essentially equal to a shifted

248
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,450
version of the null set,
or the null space.

249
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,290
This right here is
the null space.

250
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,630
That right there is the null
space for any real number x2.

251
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,900
Any scale or multiple of
3, 1 is the null space.

252
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,960
I just showed it right there.

253
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,300
It's going to be that.

254
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,020
And so all of these other
solution sets are just some

255
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,610
particular vector, some
x particular,

256
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,050
plus the null space.

257
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,300
Obviously, this vector by
itself would also be a

258
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,860
solution to Ax is equal to b,
because you can just set x2 to

259
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,120
be equal to 0.

260
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,890
So in general-- and I haven't
proven this to you rigorously,

261
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,950
but hopefully you kind of get
the intuition behind it.

262
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,370
The solution-- and I'll do this
in the next video, just

263
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,730
because I realize I'm running
long on time.

264
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:21,300
Assuming Axb has a solution-- in
the example we just did, we

265
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,070
can assume it has, if we pick
one of these points here.

266
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,540
So assuming it has a solution,
if we pick a point off of our

267
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,650
image, then we're not going
to have a solution.

268
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:38,010
But assuming Axb has a solution,
the solution set is

269
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:47,210
going to be equal to some
particular vector-- so you

270
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,480
could just think of it as a set
with just one vector right

271
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,110
there-- with, or combined with,
or the union of that

272
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:02,620
set, with your null space of
this matrix right here.

273
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,830
I haven't proven this to you
yet, but hopefully you get the

274
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,410
intuition of why this is true.

275
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,140
We just solved it for
particular cases

276
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,100
that do have solutions.

277
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,880
We say, hey, it's going
to take this form.

278
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,740
And I just showed you
that this is the

279
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,990
form of the null space.

280
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,100
   

281
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,680
And the reason why we're doing
that is because we've been

282
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,100
talking about invertibility.

283
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,860
And in order to be invertible
you have to be

284
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,520
onto, and 1 to 1.

285
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,010
And for something to be 1 to
1, you have to have at most

286
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:41,330
one solution that maps to
a particular vector.

287
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,350
You might have none.

288
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,350
But you might have,
at most, one.

289
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,050
So in order to have, at most,
one solution-- and the

290
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,950
solution set is always going to
be equal to this, so you're

291
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,440
always going to have this
solution-- so in order to

292
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,740
have, at most, one solution,
your null space can't have

293
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,440
anything in it.

294
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,315
Or it can just have
the zero vector.

295
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:01,290
   

296
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:10,275
So that means that your null
space of A has to be trivial,

297
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:20,430
or to be empty, or to just
have the zero vector.

298
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,650
I'll do this a little bit more
rigorously in the next video,

299
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,260
but I think when you do it
sometimes with the rigor, you

300
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,540
don't necessarily get
the intuition.

301
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,300
But this is going to be a very
interesting takeway, and I

302
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,500
think you already understand
it's leading up to conditions

303
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,750
for invertibility.

304
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,320
