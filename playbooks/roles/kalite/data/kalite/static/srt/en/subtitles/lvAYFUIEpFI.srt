1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
In the last video, we learned a
little bit about the circle.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,350
And the circle is really just
a special case of an ellipse.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,220
It's a special case because in
a circle you're always an equal

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,420
distance away from the center
of the circle, while in an

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,730
ellipse, the distance from the
center of the circle

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,110
is always changing.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,820
You know what an
ellipse looks like.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,300
Well, I showed you that
in the first video.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,020
It looks something like that.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,140
What I mean is that the radius
or the distance from the

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,360
center is always changing.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,630
Let me say this is
centered at the origin.

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,190
So that's the origin
right there.

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,440
You see here, we're really, if
we're on this point on the

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,010
ellipse, we're really
close to the origin.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,110
This is actually the closest
we'll ever get, just as close

18
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,520
as well get down here.

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,540
And when we're out here we're
really far away from the origin

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,650
and that's about as far as
we're going to get right there.

21
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,400
So a circle is a special case
of this, because in a circle's

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,770
case, the furthest we get from
the origin is the same distance

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,670
as the closest we get, or, in
other words, we are always

24
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,190
the exact same distance
away from the origin.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,240
Well, with that said, let's
actually go a little

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,070
bit into the math.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,640
So the general or the standard
form for an ellipse centered at

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,120
the origin is x squared over a
squared plus y squared over

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,170
b squared is equal to 1.

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,040
Where a and b are just
any two numbers.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,170
I could have written this as
c squared and d squared.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,920
I mean, they're just
place holders.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,430
Just to give you an idea of
what this means, if this was

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,180
our ellipse in question right
now, a is the length of the

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,330
radius in the x-direction.

36
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,030
Remember, we're going to
have a squared down here.

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,760
So if you took the square
root of whatever is in the

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,130
denominator, a is the x-radius.

39
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,260
So this distance in our little
chart right here, in our little

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,700
graph here, that distance is a,
or that this point right here,

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,200
since we're centered at the
origin, will be the point x is

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,160
equal to a y is equal to 0.

43
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,050
And of course this point right
here this will be a, so this

44
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,620
would be the point
minus a comma 0.

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,320
And then the radius in the
y-direction would be this

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,860
radius right here and is b.

47
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,430
So this point would be x is
equal to 0, y is equal to b.

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,720
Likewise this point right here
would be x is equal to 0,

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,010
y is equal to minus b.

50
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,730
And the way I drew this, we
have kind of a short and fat

51
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,090
ellipse you can also have kind
of a tall and skinny ellipse.

52
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,600
But in the short and fat
ellipse, the direction that

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,710
you're short in that's
called your minor axis.

54
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,010
And so b, I always forget the
exact terminology, but b you

55
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,125
can call it your semi or the
length of your semi-minor axis.

56
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:56,520
   

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,120
And where did that
word come from?

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,660
Well if this whole thing is
your minor axis or maybe you

59
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,820
could call your minor diameter
if this whole thing is your

60
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,850
minor diameter it's called
minor, because it's the

61
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,470
shortest of all of the
diameters of this ellipse.

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,210
And then the semi
is half of that.

63
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,720
   

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,840
b is the length of
the semi-minor axis.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,180
   

66
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,650
That's b in this example, just
because as I drew this ellipse

67
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,450
it just happens to be that
b is smaller then a.

68
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,860
If b was larger than a, I would
have a tall and skinny ellipse.

69
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,830
Let me actually draw one.

70
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,100
It could have been like this.

71
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,550
I could have an ellipse that
looks something like that.

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,190
In which case, all of a sudden
b would be the semi-major axis,

73
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,710
because b would be
greater than a.

74
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,440
That this would be
taller than it is wide.

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,640
But let me not confuse
the graph too much.

76
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,860
And in this case, a is the
length of-- I think you've

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:03,520
guessed it-- a is the length of
the semi-major axis or you can

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,210
even call it the length
of the major radius.

79
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,460
I think that makes more sense.

80
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,330
   

81
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,220
And you can call this
the minor radius.

82
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,390
   

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,360
So let's just do an example.

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,120
And I think when I've done an
example with actual numbers,

85
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,250
it'll make it all a
little bit clearer.

86
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,510
So let's say I were to show up
at your door with the

87
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:39,580
following: If I were to say x
squared over 9 plus y squared

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,800
over 25 is equal to 1.

89
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,350
So what is your radius
in the x-direction?

90
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,050
This is your radius in
the x-direction squared.

91
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,002
So your radius in the
x-direction if we just map

92
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,030
it, we would say that
a is equal to 3.

93
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,690
Because this is a squared.

94
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,260
And if we were just map it we'd
say this is b squared than this

95
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,930
tells us that b is equal to 5.

96
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,830
So if we wanted to graph
this, and once again this

97
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,500
is centered at the origin.

98
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,840
Let me draw the ellipse first.

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,810
So, first of all, we have our
radius in the y-direction is

100
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,140
larger than our radius
in the x-direction.

101
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,320
The ellipse is going to
be taller and skinnier.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,170
It's going to look
something like that.

103
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,060
Draw some axes, so that could
be your x-axis, your y-axis.

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,140
   

105
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,260
This is your radius
in the y-direction.

106
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,060
So this distance right here
is going to be 5, and

107
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,030
so will this distance.

108
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,960
And this is your radius
in the x-direction.

109
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,310
So this will be 3,
and this will be 3.

110
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,990
That's it.

111
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,170
You have now plotted
this ellipse.

112
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,530
Nothing too fancy about it.

113
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,720
And actually just to kind of
hit the point home that the

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,720
circle is a special
case of an ellipse.

115
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,720
We learned in the last video
that the equation of a circle

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,900
is x squared and a circle
centered at the origin.

117
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,320
x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

118
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,350
So if we were to divide both
sides of this by r squared, we

119
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,290
would get-- and this is just
little algebraic manipulation--

120
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:26,510
x squared over r squared plus y
squared over r squared

121
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,430
is equal to 1.

122
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,940
Now in this case, your a
is r and so is your b.

123
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,860
So your semi-minor axis
is r and so is your

124
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,600
semi-major axis of r.

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,500
Or, in other words, this
distance is the same as that

126
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,200
distance, and so it will
neither be short and fat

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,350
nor tall and skinny.

128
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,710
It'll be perfectly round.

129
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,750
And so that's why the circle is
a special case of an ellipse.

130
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,740
So let me give you a slightly--
It'll look a lot more

131
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,770
complicated, and this is
something you might

132
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,600
see on exam.

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,980
But I just want to show you
that this is just a shifting.

134
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,960
Let's say we wanted to
shift this ellipse.

135
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,990
Let's say we wanted to shift
it to the right by 5.

136
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,810
   

137
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,040
So instead of the origin being
at x is equal to 0, the origin

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,550
will now be at x is equal 5.

139
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,620
So a way to think about that is
what does this term have to be

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,340
so that at 5 this term
ends up being 0.

141
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,780
Well I'll actually draw it
for you, because I think

142
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,920
that might be confusing.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,170
So if we shift that over the
right by 5, the new equation of

144
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:49,950
this ellipse will be x minus 5
squared over 9 plus y squared

145
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,600
over 25 is equal to 1.

146
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,460
So if I were to just draw
this ellipse right now,

147
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,850
it would look like this.

148
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,290
I want to make it look
fairly similar to the

149
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,500
ellipse I had before.

150
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,530
It would look just like that.

151
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,180
Just shifted it over by five.

152
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,170
And the intuition we learned a
little bit in the circle video

153
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,240
where I said, oh well, you
know, if you have x minus

154
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,120
something that means that the
new origin is now

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
at positive 5.

156
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,010
And you could memorize that.

157
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,580
You could always say, oh, if I
have a minus here, that the

158
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,880
origin is at the negative of
whatever this number is, so

159
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,570
it would be a positive five.

160
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,420
You know, if you had a positive
it would be the opposite that.

161
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,950
But the way to really think
about it is now if you go to x

162
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,490
is equal to 5, when x is equal
to 5, this whole term, x minus

163
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,550
5, will behave just like
this x term will here.

164
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:47,100
When x is equal to 5 this
term is 0, just like

165
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,910
when x was 0 here.

166
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,750
So when x is equal to 5, this
term is 0, and then y squared

167
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,290
over 25 is equal 1, so y
has to be equal five.

168
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,470
Just like over here when x is
equal is 0, y squared over 25

169
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,930
had to be equal to 1,
y is equal to either

170
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,690
positive or minus 5.

171
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,550
And I really want to give
you that intuition.

172
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,970
And then, let's say we
wanted to shift this

173
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,780
equation down by two.

174
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,250
   

175
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,250
So our new ellipse looks
something like this.

176
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,530
   

177
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,310
A lot of times you learned
this in conic sections.

178
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,880
But this is true any function.

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,960
When you shift things,
you shift it this way.

180
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,340
If you shift this graph to the
right by five, you replace all

181
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,010
of the x's with x minus 5.

182
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,860
And if you were to shift it
down by two, you would replace

183
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,780
all the y's with y plus 2.

184
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,610
So let me draw our new
ellipse first, just to

185
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,580
show you what I'm doing.

186
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,770
   

187
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:59,170
So our new ellipse is going
to look something like that.

188
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,050
I'm shifting the yellow
ellipse down by two.

189
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,310
So this equation, if I shift it
down, well, the x is still

190
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:16,160
where it was before. x minus 5
squared over 9 plus y plus 2

191
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,050
squared over 25 is equal to 1.

192
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,840
And once again, the reason I
know this is because now when

193
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,180
y is minus 2, this
whole term is 0.

194
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,040
0 when y equals minus 2.

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,370
And when this term is 0, it
behaves the same way as

196
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,200
when this term was 0.

197
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,400
So when y is equal to minus 2,
you get the same behavior,

198
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,560
you're at the same point in the
curve, right here actually, as

199
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,770
you are when y equaled 0
in this one, so here.

200
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,050
So it's not the same point.

201
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,880
You can kind of view it as the
same part of the ellipse.

202
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,960
You're at kind of the maximum
width point on the ellipse here

203
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,650
and here when y is equal to 2,
and you were here at y equal to

204
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,530
0-- sorry, when y
equals minus 2.

205
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,540
This is minus 2.

206
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,390
And that's because when you
put y equals minus 2 here

207
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,980
this whole term is 0.

208
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,490
Just like when y was 0 here.

209
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,130
I don't want to make
it too confusing.

210
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,350
But just to kind of wrap it all
up, sometimes you might see

211
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:24,490
something like graph the
following: y minus 1 squared

212
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:33,430
over 4 plus x plus 2 squared
over 9 is equal to 1.

213
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,760
And so the first thing you
could say is OK this is just

214
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,410
like the standard ellipse y
squared over 4 plus x squared

215
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,040
over 9 is equal to one.

216
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,040
It's just like this,
but it's shifted over.

217
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:55,170
This ones origin is 0,0, while
this ones origin would be what?

218
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,170
It would be the point x
is minus 2 and y is 1.

219
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,110
So if you were to graph
this, your radius in

220
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,680
your y-direction is 2.

221
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
2 squared is equal to 4.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,590
Your radius in your
x-direction is 3.

223
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,900
3 squared is equal to 9.

224
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,870
So your x-radius is actually
larger than your y-radius.

225
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,860
So, it's going to be a little
bit of a fat ellipse.

226
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,265
Actually, let me draw
the axes first.

227
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:28,360
   

228
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,290
Let me draw it like this.

229
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:38,120
That's my vertical axis,
this is my x-axis.

230
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,450
And so my center is
now at minus 2, 1.

231
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,920
   

232
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,040
That's minus 2,
and I go up one.

233
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,830
That's the center
of my ellipse.

234
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,560
And now in the x-direction,
this is the x term,

235
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,850
my x-radius is 3.

236
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,780
So the ellipse will go
three-- in that direction.

237
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,210
This is it's widest point
will be 3 in that direction.

238
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,700
And then in the y-direction,
it'll go 2, so it'll go up

239
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,030
1, 2 so that's there and
then 1, 2 and it's there.

240
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,140
So if I were to draw that
ellipse it would look something

241
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,770
like this through my best shot.

242
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,930
   

243
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,170
A little bit fatter than it
is tall, and that's because

244
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,590
your x-radius is larger
than your y-radius.

245
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,440
This distance right here is 3,
this distance right here is 3,

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,530
this distance right here is 2,
this distance right here is 2.

247
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,950
You could figure out
what these points are.

248
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,590
I won't do all of them right
now just for the sake of time.

249
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,410
But this right here is
the point minus 2, 1.

250
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,810
So if you go three more than
that-- so if you add 3 to

251
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,730
the x-direction this is
the point 1 comma 1.

252
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,445
If you would take three away
from the x-direction, this

253
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:00,740
would be minus 5 comma 1.

254
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,260
And you could figure
out the other points.

255
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,900
That might be good
exercise for you.

256
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,910
Anyway that's a little
bit on ellipses.

257
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,970
In future videos we'll do
really hairy problems where you

258
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,480
have to simplify it into this
form so that we know that it

259
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,550
definitely is an ellipse.

260
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,969
