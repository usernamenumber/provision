1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,020
Write six hundred forty-five
million five hundred

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,150
eighty-four thousand
four hundred

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,600
sixty-two in standard form.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,000
So let's tackle this
piece by piece.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,059
So the first part we
have six hundred

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,703
and forty-five million.

8
00:00:18,703 --> 00:00:21,660
   

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,580
So let's think about that.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,900
So we have six hundred
and forty-five.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,940
   

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,790
But it's not just six
hundred forty-five.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,540
We have six hundred forty-five
millions.

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,960
So we could view that as
645 times 1,000,000.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,410
One million is one followed
by six zeroes.

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,940
So this piece right here is
this right over here.

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,840
That is six hundred and
forty-five million.

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,350
And what is that when
we write it out?

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,675
If we were to multiply this
out, this is equal to-- it

20
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:57,800
would be 645 times this 1 with
six zeroes behind it.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,920
So this would be equal to 600--
I'll write it like this.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,690
This is equal to 645, and then
we have our six zeroes.

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,560
One, two, three, one,
two, three.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,860
That's just this part
of the number.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,510
And I'm going to do it kind
of slow and do all of the

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,710
different parts of the problem,
but once you get some

27
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,610
practice, you'll find that these
are a bit second nature,

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,240
and you won't have to go through
all of these steps.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
You'll just be able to
write the number.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,790
Now, let's move on
to the next part.

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,680
We have five hundred
and eighty-four.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,010
Let me write that down.

33
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,700
   

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,300
Well, I'll write it like this.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,070
584 thousand.

36
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,100
So let me write the thousand.

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,760
So 584 thousand.

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,300
So it's 584 times 1,000.

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,870
And what's that going
to look like?

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,600
So that's this whole
part right here.

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,400
So 584 times 1,000
is equal to what?

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,840
Well, it's going to be 584 with
three zeroes behind it,

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,863
or you could view it as 584
times the 1, and then you're

44
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:04,010
going to have three zeroes
in the final answer.

45
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:11,620
So it's going to be 584,000.

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,400
We have our three zeroes
at the end.

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,030
584, three zeroes.

48
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,250
So that's that part.

49
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:22,910
And then finally, we have four
hundred sixty-two, and that's

50
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,960
just 462, straight up.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,330
You could view it as 462 ones.

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,280
So then you just
have 462, which

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,280
obviously equals just 462.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,430
Now our number is all
of these combined.

55
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,450
It is 645,000,000 and
584,000 and 462.

56
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,000
So one way to think about it
is that you could add these

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,330
three numbers.

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:03:08,300
So if we were to add them,
we get 645,584,462.

59
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,570
Now, I said it'll become a
little bit of second nature to

60
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,230
you in a little bit, and the way
to think about that, the

61
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,040
easiest way to think about that,
is millions will have

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,600
six zeroes behind them,
thousands will have three

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,290
zeroes behind them, and just
regular numbers have no zeroes

64
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,350
behind them.

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,940
So what you can do when you
kind of want to learn it

66
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,020
second nature, you'll just look
at the six hundred and

67
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,060
forty-five million, so you'll
write 645, and you'll kind of

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,320
keep in the back of your mind
that you're going to have to

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,310
have six more digits to
the right of this.

70
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,720
And then you say five hundred
and eighty-four thousand, so

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,030
then you have your five hundred
and eighty-four

72
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,320
thousand, so then you write that
down, 584,000, keeping in

73
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,620
mind that you're going to
need three digits to

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,530
the right of that.

75
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,470
And so if they didn't tell us
462, we would just put three

76
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,270
zeroes here, and that would also
fulfill the six zeroes we

77
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,490
need behind 645,000,000.

78
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,830
But then they tell us 462, so we
just write that right here.

79
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,350
462.

80
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,467
