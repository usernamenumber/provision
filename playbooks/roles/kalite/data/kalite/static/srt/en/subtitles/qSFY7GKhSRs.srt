1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,000
I've already told you multiple
times that big, uppercase U is

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,754
the internal energy
of a system.

4
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:10,220
And it's really everything
thrown in there.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,490
It's the kinetic energy
of the molecules.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,700
It has the potential energy if
the molecules are vibrating.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,660
It has the chemical energy
of the bonds.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,060
It has the potential energy of
electrons that want to get

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,590
some place.

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,200
But, for our sake, and
especially if we're kind of in

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,130
an introductory chemistry,
physics, or thermodynamics

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,229
course, let's just assume that
we're talking about a system

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,570
that's an ideal gas.

14
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,500
And even better, it's a kind
of a monoatomic ideal gas.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,390
So everything in on my system
are just individual atoms. So

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,200
in that case, the only energy in
the system is all going to

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,310
be the kinetic energy of each
of these particles.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,080
So what I want to do in this
video-- it's going to get a

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,780
little bit mathy, but I think
it'll be satisfying for those

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,880
of you who stick with it-- is
to relate how much internal

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,010
energy there really is in a
system of a certain pressure,

22
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,850
volume, or temperature.

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,060
So we want to relate pressure,
volume, or temperature to

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,190
internal energy.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,730
Notice all the videos we've done
up until now, I just said

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,420
what's the change in
internal energy.

27
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,810
And we related that to the heat
put into or taken out of

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,600
a system, or the work
done, or done to,

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,760
or done by the system.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,490
But now, let's just say before
we do any work or any heat,

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,445
how do we know how much internal
energy we even have

32
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:25,680
in a system?

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,770
And to do this, let's do a
little bit of a thought

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,800
experiment.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,740
There is a bit of a
simplification I'll make here.

36
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,130
But I think you'll find it OK,
or reasonably satisfying.

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,210
So let's say-- let me just
draw it-- I have a cube.

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,810
And something tells me that I
might have already done this

39
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,230
pseudo-proof in the physics play
list. Although, I don't

40
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,090
think I related exactly
to internal energy.

41
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,930
So I'll do that here.

42
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,160
Let's say my system
is this cube.

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,180
And let's say the dimensions
of the cube

44
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,110
are x in every direction.

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,010
So it's x high, x wide,
and x deep.

46
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,510
So its volume is, of course,
x to the third.

47
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,389
And let's say I have
n particles in my

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,600
system, capital N.

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,480
I could have written lowercase
n moles, but let's just keep

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,260
it straightforward.

51
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,510
I have N particles.

52
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,260
   

53
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,810
So they're all doing
what they will.

54
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,030
Now, this is where I'm going
to make the gross

55
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,100
simplification.

56
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,610
But I think it's reasonable.

57
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,210
So in a normal system, every
particle, and we've done this

58
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,410
before, is just bouncing off
in every which way, every

59
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,330
possible random direction.

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,950
And that's what, when they
ricochet off of each of the

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,420
sides, that's what causes
the pressure.

62
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,750
And they're always bumping into
each other, et cetera, et

63
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,360
cetera, in all random
directions.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,170
Now, for the sake of simplicity
of our mathematics,

65
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,000
and just to be able to do it
in a reasonable amount of

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
time, I'm going to make
an assumption.

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,340
I'm going to make an assumption
that 1/3 of the

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,210
particles are going-- well, 1/3
of the particles are going

69
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,730
parallel to each of the axes.

70
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,660
So 1/3 of the particles are
going in this direction, I

71
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,710
guess we could say,
left to right.

72
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,440
1/3 of the particles are
going up and down.

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,300
   

74
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,970
And then 1/3 of the particles
are going forward and back.

75
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,520
Now, we know that this isn't
what's going in reality, but

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,350
it makes our math
a lot simpler.

77
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,640
And if you actually were to do
the statistical mechanics

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,370
behind all of the particles
going in every which way, you

79
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,350
would actually end up getting
the same result.

80
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,820
Now, with that said, I'm
saying it's a gross

81
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,590
oversimplification.

82
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,840
There is some infinitesimally
small chance that we actually

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
do fall onto a system where
this is already the case.

84
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,860
And we'll talk a little bit
later about entropy and why

85
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,400
it's such a small probability.

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,200
But this could actually
be our system.

87
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
And this system would
generate pressure.

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,420
And it makes our math
a lot simpler.

89
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,770
So with that said, let's
study this system.

90
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,070
So let's take a sideways view.

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,010
Let's take a sideways
view right here.

92
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,770
   

93
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,800
And let's just study
one particle.

94
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
Maybe I should have
done it in green.

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,670
But let's say I have
one particle.

96
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,660
It has some mass, m, and
some velocity, v.

97
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,500
   

98
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,890
And this is one of the capital
N particles in my system.

99
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,190
But what I'm curious is how
much pressure does this

100
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,010
particle exert on this
wall right here?

101
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,530
   

102
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,180
We know what the area of
this wall is, right?

103
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,260
The area of this wall
is x times x.

104
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,740
So it's x squared area.

105
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,910
How much force is being exerted
by this particle?

106
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,880
Well, let's think about
it this way.

107
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,960
It's going forward, or left
to right just like this.

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,240
And the force will be exerted
when it changes its momentum.

109
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,420
I'll do a little bit of review
of kinetics right here.

110
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,800
We know that force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,700
We know acceleration can be
written as, which is equal to

112
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:10,630
mass times, change in velocity
over change in time.

113
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,940
And, of course, we know that
this could be rewritten as

114
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,800
this is equal to-- mass is a
constant and shouldn't change

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,500
for the physics we deal
with-- so it's delta.

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,140
We could put that inside
of the change.

117
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,820
So it's delta mv over
change in time.

118
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,730
And this is just change
in momentum, right?

119
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,890
So this is equal to change in
momentum over change in time.

120
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,030
So that's another way
to write force.

121
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,560
So what's the change
in momentum going

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,980
to be for this particle?

123
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,800
Well, it's going to bump
into this wall.

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,180
In this direction, right now,
it has some momentum.

125
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,250
Its momentum is equal to mv.

126
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,420
And it's going to bump into this
wall, and then going to

127
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,130
ricochet straight back.

128
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,530
And what's its momentum
going to be?

129
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,990
Well, it's going to
have the same mass

130
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,220
and the same velocity.

131
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,190
We'll assume it's a completely
elastic collision.

132
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,270
Nothing is lost to heat
or whatever else.

133
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,980
But the velocity is in
the other direction.

134
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,640
So the new momentum is going
to be minus mv, because the

135
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,380
velocity has switched
directions.

136
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,590
Now, if I come in with a
momentum of mv, and I ricochet

137
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,950
off with a momentum of
minus mv, what's

138
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,890
my change in momentum?

139
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,720
My change in momentum, off of
that ricochet, is equal to--

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,220
well, it's the difference
between these two,

141
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,470
which is just 2mv.

142
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,830
   

143
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,230
Now, that doesn't give
me the force.

144
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,860
I need to know the change in
momentum per unit of time.

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,390
   

146
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,840
So how often does this happen?

147
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,410
How frequently?

148
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,040
Well, it's going to happen
every time we come here.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,020
We're going to hit this wall.

150
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,670
Then the particle is going to
have to travel here, bounce

151
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,080
off of that wall, and
then come back

152
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,370
here and hit it again.

153
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,600
So that's how frequently
it's going to happen.

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,280
So how long of an interval do
we have to wait between the

155
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,450
collisions?

156
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,040
Well, the particle has to
travel x going back.

157
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,300
It's going to collide.

158
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,790
It's going to have to travel
x to the left.

159
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,090
This distance is x.

160
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,890
Let me do that in a
different color.

161
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,720
This distance right here is x.

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,310
It's going to have to
travel x to go back.

163
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,800
Then it's going to have
to travel x back.

164
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,740
So it's going to have to
travel 2x distance.

165
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,060
And how long will it take it
to travel 2x distance?

166
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,100
Well, the time, delta T, is
equal to, we know this.

167
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,710
Distance is equal to
rate times time.

168
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:29,390
Or if we do distance divided by
rate, we'll get the amount

169
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,630
of time we took.

170
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,900
This is just our basic
motion formula.

171
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,500
Our delta T, the distance
we have to

172
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,830
travel is back and forth.

173
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,040
So it's 2 x's, divided
by-- what's our rate?

174
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,720
Well, our rate is
our velocity.

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,970
Divided by v.

176
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,810
   

177
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,260
There you go.

178
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,440
So this is our delta
T right here.

179
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:03,680
So our change in momentum per
time is equal to 2 times our

180
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,620
incident momentum.

181
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,500
Because we ricocheted back with
the same magnitude, but

182
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,430
negative momentum.

183
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,475
So that's our change
in momentum.

184
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:12,890
And then our change in time
is this value over here.

185
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,380
It's the total distance we
have to travel between

186
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,800
collisions of this wall, divided
by our velocity.

187
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:27,920
So it is, 2x divided by v, which
is equal to 2mv times

188
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,780
the reciprocal of this-- so
this is just fraction

189
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,755
math-- v over 2x.

190
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:34,010
And what is this equal to?

191
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,710
The 2's cancel out.

192
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,710
So that is equal to mv
squared, over x.

193
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,260
Interesting.

194
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,250
We're getting someplace
interesting already.

195
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,590
And if it doesn't seem too
interesting, just hang on with

196
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,260
me for a second.

197
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,520
Now, this is the force being
applied by one particle, is

198
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,730
this-- force from one particle
on this wall.

199
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,330
   

200
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,840
Now, what was the area?

201
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,090
We care about the pressure.

202
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,200
   

203
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,610
We wrote it up here.

204
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,890
The pressure is equal to
the force per area.

205
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,360
   

206
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
So this is the force
of that particle.

207
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,570
So that's mv squared
over x, divided by

208
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,840
the area of the wall.

209
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,730
Well, what's the area
of the wall?

210
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,200
The area of the wall here,
each sideis x.

211
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,610
And so if we draw the wall
there, it's x times x.

212
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,360
It's x squared.

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,390
So divided by the area of
the wall, is x squared.

214
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,250
And what does this equal?

215
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:52,370
This is equal to mv squared
over x cubed.

216
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,790
You can just say, this is times
1 over x squared, when

217
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,760
this all becomes x cubed.

218
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,530
This is just fraction math.

219
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,120
So now we have an interesting
thing.

220
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:07,160
The pressure due to this one
particle-- let's just call

221
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:14,220
this from this one particle--
is equal to m v

222
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,750
squared over x cubed.

223
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,650
Now, what's x cubed?

224
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,960
That's the volume of
our container.

225
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,210
Over the volume.

226
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,120
I'll do that in a
big V, right?

227
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,130
So let's see if we can relate
this to something else that's

228
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,630
interesting.

229
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,820
So that means that the pressure
being exerted by this

230
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,220
one particle-- well, actually
let me just take another step.

231
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,280
So this is one particle
on this wall, right?

232
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,900
This is from one particle
on this wall.

233
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,890
Now, of all the particles-- we
have N particles in our cube--

234
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,860
what fraction of them
are going to be

235
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,170
bouncing off of this wall?

236
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,730
That are going to be doing
the exact same

237
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,950
thing as this particle?

238
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,820
Well, I just said.

239
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,380
1/3 are going to be going
in this direction.

240
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,820
1/3 are going to be
going up and down.

241
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,930
And 1/3 are going to go
be going in and out.

242
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,420
So if I have N total particles,
N over 3 are going

243
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,195
to be doing exactly what this
particle is going to be doing.

244
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,740
   

245
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,350
This is the pressure
from one particle.

246
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,850
If I wanted the pressure from
all of the particles on that

247
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,960
wall-- so the total pressure
on that wall is going to be

248
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
from N over 3 of
the particles.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,990
The other particles aren't
bouncing off that wall.

250
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,700
So we don't have to
worry about them.

251
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,620
So if we want the total pressure
on that wall-- I'll

252
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,150
just write, pressure
sub on the wall.

253
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,060
Total pressure on the wall is
going to be the pressure from

254
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,400
one particle, mv squared, over
our volume, times the total

255
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,950
number of particles
hitting the wall.

256
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,750
The total number of particles
is N divided by 3, because

257
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,270
only 3 will be going
in that direction.

258
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,800
So, the total pressure on that
wall is equal to mv squared,

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,790
over our volume of our
container, times the total

260
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,115
particles divided by 3.

261
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:57,610
Let's see if we can manipulate
this thing a little bit.

262
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,420
So if we multiply both sides
by-- let's see what we can do.

263
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:14,390
If we multiply both sides by 3v,
we get pv times 3 is equal

264
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:21,730
to mv squared, times N, where N
is the number of particles.

265
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,580
Let's divide both sides by N.

266
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:34,270
So we get 3pv over-- actually,
no, let me leave the N there.

267
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:41,240
Let's divide both sides
of this equation by 2.

268
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,520
So we get, what do we get?

269
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,320
We get 3/2 pv is equal to--
now this is interesting.

270
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,780
It's equal to N, the number of
particles we have, times mv

271
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,920
squared over 2.

272
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,610
Remember, I just divided
this equation right

273
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,650
here by 2 to get this.

274
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,280
And I did this for a very
particular reason.

275
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,260
What is mv squared over 2?

276
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,910
mv squared over 2 is the kinetic
energy of that little

277
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,140
particle we started off with.

278
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,900
That's the formula for
kinetic energy.

279
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:20,070
Kinetic energy is equal
to mv squared over 2.

280
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,950
So this is the kinetic energy
of one particle.

281
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:28,570
   

282
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,890
Now, we're multiplying that
times the total number of

283
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,280
particles we have, times N.

284
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,890
So N times the kinetic energy of
one particle is going to be

285
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,490
the kinetic energy of
all the particles.

286
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,430
And, of course, we also made
another assumption.

287
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,160
I should state that I assumed
that all the particles are

288
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,510
moving with the same velocity
and have the same mass.

289
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,880
In a real situation, the
particles might have very

290
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,060
different velocities.

291
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,980
But this was one of our
simplifying assumptions.

292
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,850
So, we just assumed they
all have that.

293
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,890
So, if I multiply N times that--
this statement right

294
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,285
here-- is the kinetic energy
of the system.

295
00:13:56,285 --> 00:14:01,700
   

296
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,140
Now, we're almost there.

297
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,480
In fact, we are there.

298
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,610
We just established that the
kinetic energy of the system

299
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,730
is equal to 3/2 times the
pressure, times the volume of

300
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,650
the system.

301
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,270
Now, what is the kinetic
energy of the system?

302
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,320
It's the internal energy.

303
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,290
Because we said all the energy
in the system, because it's a

304
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,900
simple ideal monoatomic gas,
all of the energy in the

305
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,770
system is in kinetic energy.

306
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,980
So we could say the internal
energy of the system is equal

307
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,370
to-- that's just the total
kinetic energy of the system--

308
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,020
it's equal to 3/2 times our
total pressure, times our

309
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,620
total volume.

310
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,070
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
you just figured out the

311
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,130
pressure on this side.

312
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,960
What about the pressure on that
side, and that side, and

313
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,730
that side, or on every
side of the cube?

314
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,850
Well, the pressure on
every side of the

315
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,250
cube is the same value.

316
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,530
So all we have to do is find
in terms of the pressure on

317
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,420
one side, and that's essentially
the pressure of

318
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,480
the system.

319
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,590
So what else can we
do with that?

320
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,700
Well, we know that pv is equal
to nRT, our ideal gas formula.

321
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,475
pv is equal to nRT, where this
is the number of moles of gas.

322
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,410
And this is the ideal
gas constant.

323
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,240
This is our temperature
in kelvin.

324
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,880
So if we make that replacement,
we'll say that

325
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,140
internal energy can also be
written as 3/2 times the

326
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,500
number of moles we have, times
the ideal gas constant, times

327
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,290
our temperature.

328
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,560
Now, I did a lot of work, and
it's a little bit mathy.

329
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,780
But these results are,
one, interesting.

330
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,140
Because now you have a
direct relationship.

331
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,860
If you know the pressure and the
volume, you know what the

332
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,530
actual internal energy, or
the total kinetic energy,

333
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,660
of the system is.

334
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,350
Or, if you know what the
temperature and the number of

335
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,320
molecules you have are, you also
know what the internal

336
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,630
energy of the system is.

337
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,520
And there's a couple of key
takeaways I want you to have.

338
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,070
If the temperature does not
change in our ideal situation

339
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,930
here-- if delta T is equal to
0-- if this doesn't change,

340
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,680
the number particles aren't
going to change.

341
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,750
Then our internal energy does
not change as well.

342
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,030
So if we say that there is
some change in internal

343
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,790
energy, and I'll use this in
future proofs, we could say

344
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,360
that that's equal to 3/2 times
nR times-- well, the only

345
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,850
thing that can change, not the
number molecules or the ideal

346
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,350
gas constant-- times
the change in T.

347
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,000
Or, it could also be written as
3/2 times the change in pv.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,450
We don't know if either
of these are constant.

349
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,520
So we have to say the change
in the product.

350
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,780
Anyway, this was a
little bit mathy.

351
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,050
And I apologize for it.

352
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,840
But hopefully, it gives you a
little bit more sense that

353
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,300
this really is just the sum
of all the kinetic energy.

354
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,420
We related it to some of these
macro state variables, like

355
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,590
pressure, volume, and time.

356
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,640
And now, since I've done the
video on it, we can actually

357
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,990
use this result in
future proofs.

358
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,220
Or at least you won't complain
too much if I do.

359
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,470
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

360
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,460
