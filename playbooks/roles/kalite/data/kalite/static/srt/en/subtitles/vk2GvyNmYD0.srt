1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:07,229
So how do you approach a painting
that is so famous,

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:09,696
that has become an
icon of a nation?

3
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:13,662
We're looking at Grant Wood's
"American Gothic" from 1930

4
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:19,890
which more than any other painting
has come to represent America and Middle America

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,657
and small-town America for many people.

6
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:26,241
Wood said that this was a father 
and a daughter,

7
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,357
but we know that the models were his
dentist and his sister.

8
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:32,840
It's as contested as 
our nation is.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,356
It has as many readings as we have 
ideas about what our country is.

10
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:40,923
So in some ways it depends on which side
of the political spectrum you're on.

11
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:45,439
If you're a city person, you think that 
he's mocking the people who live in the Midwest,

12
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,540
and if you're a Midwesterner, you think, oh,
he's one of us,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,991
and he captured who we are.

14
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,657
Although the opposite could 
also be true.

15
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:56,939
The Easterners, perhaps, looked at these Iowans
represented in this painting, and said,

16
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,640
"Ah, that's what they're like."

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,339
And the Iowans sometimes looked at this
and we're worried they were being mocked.

18
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:05,222
There's a lot of meaning in this painting.

19
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:10,122
Okay, so we can look at it at face value
at its most simplified and see this farmer,

20
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:12,673
see, perhaps, as the artist said,
his daughter,

21
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,505
standing before their simple farmhouse.

22
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:19,790
So there's a sense of hard-working,
practical people,

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,260
a kind of conservative aspect of America.

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,260
There's something archaic here.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,859
Everything in this painting does seem
homemade.

26
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:32,526
The carpenter Gothic house in back of them,
the apron that the woman wears, his overalls,

27
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,692
everything seems as if it could have been
made by these people.

28
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:40,759
This is 1930, and the United States is an
intensely industrial culture.

29
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,176
And even by Iowa standards, this painting is
a very archaic image

30
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:50,725
But the quality that is most present here for me
is the confrontation with these figures.

31
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,976
They stand right up in front of us.

32
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:55,426
We're not sure what he's going to say.

33
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:58,443
But I do get the sense that his face
is about to change,

34
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:02,793
and he's either going to open up
with a smile, or there is going to be something

35
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:05,259
fairly stern coming from him.

36
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:06,426
It's hard to read him, actually.

37
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,476
And I'm not sure that he's looking
directly at us.

38
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:13,367
But whether he is stern or kind
seems to really be indeterminate.

39
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:19,134
And she looks off at something we can't see, something outside of the space of the painting.

40
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:22,534
In fact, that ambiguity, I think,
is pervasive throughout this painting.

41
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,783
I think it's one of the reasons this painting
is, in fact, so powerful,

42
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:29,284
and has become such a symbol
of the American heartland

43
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:32,185
because people can see in it
what they want.

44
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,282
I think it helps to know something
about Grant Wood himself.

45
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:39,951
He grew up on a really remote farm
in a remote part of Iowa

46
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:44,185
with his two brothers and sister
and his parents.

47
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,984
He was really isolated.

48
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,633
His father was very strict.

49
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,467
He didn't really fit in with
his family.

50
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,483
He had a kind of softer,
more artistic side to him

51
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:56,500
than the masculine side of
his brothers and his father,

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,116
and he was very close to
his mother.

53
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,867
His father died young.

54
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:05,567
So a complicated biography that I think
does make its way into this painting.

55
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,867
Well, he is a complex figure.

56
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:09,852
Sometimes we think of him as a kind
of two-dimensional figure,

57
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:13,184
an Americanist, a Regionalist, the
American scene,

58
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:15,651
that is, somebody who painted
from the heartland.

59
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:16,967
These were his people.

60
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,317
Grant Wood, along with Thomas Hart Benton,
and a number of other artists,

61
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,918
are establishing what they're
calling Regionalism,

62
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,817
what others call American
scene painting.

63
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:28,117
That is, a figurative tradition
of the Middle West

64
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:30,485
that speaks to American values.

65
00:03:30,485 --> 00:03:32,884
But he was a much more
complex figure.

66
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:37,685
He spent a lot of time in Paris
as did most artists of his generation,

67
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,651
painting in a semi-impressionist style.

68
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:42,367
He also spent time in Munich.

69
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,268
So he wasn't quite as American
as our idea of him,

70
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,801
or the idea that this painting
gives us.

71
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:52,501
In fact, art historians link the kind
of hard-edged style and the change

72
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,867
from Impressionism to his having
absorbed the influence

73
00:03:55,867 --> 00:04:00,518
of early Northern Renaissance painters
like Van Eyck and Memling,

74
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:04,550
and perhaps also the Neue
Sachlichkeit of contemporary German painting.

75
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,634
Right, on his visit to Munich,
in the 1920s.

76
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:11,484
And so this is a painter who is influenced
by European traditions,

77
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:16,366
although he's turning those lessons
on his own people, on the American landscape,

78
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:17,717
on the American pysche.

79
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,384
We certainly see that influence of
the Northern Renaissance, I think,

80
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:25,742
especially in the face of the male figure
where we have almost a map of this man's face

81
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:28,492
with every wrinkle and crease.

82
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:32,391
We can see the individual lines of
his eyebrows, for example.

83
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:36,525
You can almost see where the pores
will allow the beard to emerge ultimately.

84
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,660
I mean, there is a kind of specificity here
that is almost terrifying.

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,943
And I think that specificity is in his face
and not so much in the rest of the picture.

86
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:48,609
If you look at the trees in the background,
they've become rounded, geometric shapes

87
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:50,026
that are generalized.

88
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:56,809
And so the rest of the painting has
a sense of geometry, of lines and circles and zigzags.

89
00:04:56,809 --> 00:05:00,743
And there's a way that the artist
takes the specific and creates

90
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,726
a kind of more universal form out of it.

91
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:04,794
I think the trees are a perfect example of that.

92
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:08,492
This is both real and symbolic.

93
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:13,627
But I think it is important not to ignore
the broader context in which this work was made.

94
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:14,810
This is 1930.

95
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,992
The United States had recently gone through
one of its most prosperous moments,

96
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:22,009
but just the year before, 1929, the stock
market crashed,

97
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,592
and the economy stalled.

98
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:27,942
If you think about the broader political
situation, you have in Europe

99
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:33,810
the fascists just beginning to take power,
and there is an important political ideology

100
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,975
that goes with that, which is often speaking
of going back to a kind of rural, primitive experience.

101
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:43,849
And so some art historians have looked at 
this American scene painting

102
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:50,250
and seen a kind of echo of anti-internationalism
that was seen as very dangerous,

103
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,949
and in a sense the root of
European fascism.

104
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,950
I suppose as patriotism itself, this painting
has been read in a whole bunch of different ways.

105
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,400
It's had psychoanalytic readings.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,650
It's had political readings.

107
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,900
And it's had kind of historical readings.

108
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,684
And I think it is important to embed this painting
in not only the artist's biography

109
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,183
but also the historical moment in 
which it was made.
