1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,370
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,030
Well we left off on
problem number 13.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,170
But let me start it over just so that we don't get confused

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,320
kind of doing the problem over the course of two videos.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,680
So number 13.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,990
It starts off with
this pattern.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,070
3, 5, minus 5.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,330
And what it says in the problem
is that each even

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,650
number term is 2 more than
the previous term.

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,580
And then each odd number term is negative 1 times the

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,430
previous term.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,950
So we started with 3.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:41,400
So let me say term-- let me write it here, term-- term and

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,650
then value.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,630
And then what we did.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,970
Maybe we could call that
f of x or the function.

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,940
How did we go from one
value to the next?

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,080
So if we make a table,
term one is value 3.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,850
And that's just the
starting one.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,800
Term two is 5.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,540
That's because we added
2, we added 2 to 3.

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,840
We could write 3 plus
2 is equal to 5.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,450
Term three is minus 5.

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:29,070
And that's because minus 1 times this 5-- let me draw

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,500
these arrows-- is equal
to minus 5.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,920
And then we add again-- I'm going to switch colors just to

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,170
keep it interesting.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:47,220
So term four is going to be
minus 5 plus 2, which

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,470
equals minus 3.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:01,380
Then term five is going to be minus 3 times minus 1, which

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,640
equals 3 again.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,180
Right?

33
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,750
And I think you see how we're getting these patterns.

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,860
You just keep switching
between adding 2 and

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,380
multiplying by negative 1.

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,040
And then so term six is
going to be what?

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
It's going to be this
plus 2, which is 5.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,650
I think you're seeing
the pattern again.

39
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,960
Let me do a bunch more and I'll do it outside of the

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,150
scope of this chart.

41
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,500
The term seven is going
to be what?

42
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,180
It's going to be minus 1
times that, so minus 5.

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,450
And you see the pattern now.

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,820
Term eight is going
to be minus 3.

45
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:40,580
Term nine is going to be what?

46
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,540
Minus 3, minus 3.

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,310
So here we added 2 so we multiply it by negative 1.

48
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,100
So it's going to be 3 again.

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,540
And you could just experiment
with yourself.

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,670
Once you understand how soon. the sequence works, do a bunch

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,370
of terms until you
see a cycle.

52
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,130
And that's the key thing.

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,250
In any SAT problem, when
they ask you like what

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,800
is the 100th term?

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,260
It's going to have a cycle because they don't expect you

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,000
to sit and write out 100
terms because you

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,210
would run out of time.

58
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,520
So if they ask you the 100th term, the pattern probably

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,030
repeats every three or four or five or, at most, six terms.

60
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,490
And then you can use that
to figure out what

61
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,630
the 100th term is.

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,780
So here we see that the pattern
repeats-- let's see,

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,340
3, 5, negative 5, negative 3.

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,590
3, 5, negative 5,
negative 3, 3.

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,900
So we see it repeats every
fourth term, right?

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,170
This is kind of one cycle, then
3, 5, negative 3, and

67
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,590
this is another cycle.

68
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,760
So it has this four pattern.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,950
So can we come up with any term that is a multiple of 4,

70
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,120
what is our value?

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,070
Well at 4 our value
is minus 3.

72
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,940
What's the next multiple of 4?

73
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,160
8.

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,560
At 8 our value's minus 3.

75
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,780
So in general-- and if we did 12 we'd also get minus 3.

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,070
If you don't believe me
you should try it out.

77
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,730
So at any multiple of 4, we know our value is minus 3.

78
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:16,500
So what I do is, they want
to know the 55th term.

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,750
So what term is a multiple of 4 that's closest to 55?

80
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,610
Let's see, is 56 a
multiple of 4?

81
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:25,800
Yeah.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,240
56-- that's 10.

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,330
14 times 4 is 56, right?

84
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,800
So the 56th term, we know the 56th term because 56 is a

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,940
multiple of 4, just like
4 and 8 and 12.

86
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,980
So the 56th term-- I have
trouble saying that.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,175
Maybe I have a little lisp.

88
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:47,540
56th term is negative
3, right?

89
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,640
Because it's a multiple of 4.

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,900
If the 56th term is negative 3, what is the 55th term?

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,260
Well the term before the negative 3 term is always the

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,700
negative 5 term, right?

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,830
Up here, negative 3?

94
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,820
It's always negative 5.

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,880
So the answer is negative
5 is the 55th term, and

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,910
that is choice A.

97
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,780
Very good.

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,685
All right, let's move on
to the next question.

99
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,690
I know that one's a little hard, and those you always

100
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,630
just have to experiment a little
bit, try to see the

101
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,150
cycle, and then make sure you have your terms right.

102
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,860
You know that you're starting on the first term as opposed

103
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,820
to the 0 term.

104
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,190
And then figure out what the easiest value is as close what

105
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,080
they're asking as possible and then you can kind of move

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,310
backwards or forwards.

107
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,180
That's how I do it.

108
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,120
That's so you don't get too confused with the shifts on

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
the terms.

110
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,300
All right, number 14.

111
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,190
In the xy plane, the equation you of line l is-- let me

112
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,910
write that down-- number 14.

113
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:56,730
The equation of line l is
y is equal to 2x plus 5.

114
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,920
If the line m is the reflection
of l in the x-axis,

115
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,980
what is the equation
of line m?

116
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,570
So I'm going to draw a graph
for you, just so you

117
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,540
understand what I'm doing.

118
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,690
But on the real SAT you really don't have to do this because

119
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,120
you wouldn't want to
run out of time.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,610
Oh man, I'm going to run out of time if I can't draw a

121
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,430
straight line.

122
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,770
I'm being a stickler for this.

123
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,260
Oh, I still couldn't do it.

124
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,510
I'll move forward.

125
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,200
So this line, so y
equals 2x plus 5.

126
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,810
So if you remember from our slope and y-intercept modules,

127
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,120
the y-intercept's going
to be 5, right here.

128
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,530
And then the line's going
to have a slope of 2.

129
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,330
Right?

130
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,253
So the line's going to look
something like this.

131
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,960
That's line l.

132
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,890
This is line l.

133
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,740
And then we want to know, they say line m is the reflection

134
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,240
of l in the x-axis.

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
So reflection would
kind of be the

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,540
x-axis-- this is the x-axis.

137
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,860
So it's like if we were looking
at this in a pool of

138
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,380
water, the reflection would be like if you took this and

139
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,180
flipped it over the x-axis.

140
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,120
So the line m is going to look
something like this.

141
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,650
Line m is going to
look like this.

142
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,570
So a couple of things.

143
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,060
It's like the mirror image.

144
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,920
If we flipped it, it's like we
flipped it over the axis.

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,210
So if the y-intercept here is
5, the y-intercept here is

146
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,076
going to be minus 5.

147
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:46,680
Right?

148
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,870
Because we just flipped it.

149
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,210
And similarly, if every one
this moves up 2, right,

150
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,110
because that's at slope.

151
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,280
2.

152
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,340
For every one we move here
to the right we're

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,830
going to go down 2.

154
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,670
So the slope is going to be
the negative of this or

155
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,240
negative 2.

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,165
So line m, so this is line m, the equation of line m's going

157
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:09,480
to be y is equal to-- it's going
to have the negative

158
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,500
slope, right?

159
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,140
The same slope, but
it just moves in

160
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,100
the downward direction.

161
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,220
So it's going to be minus 2x.

162
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,150
And then its y-intercept is-- instead of plus 5 it's going

163
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,320
to be minus 5.

164
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,130
Minus 2x minus 5.

165
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,990
And that is choice A.

166
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,190
Looks like the next problem involves a lot of drawing, and

167
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,440
I only have a minute and a
half left in this video.

168
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,330
So I will do the next problem
in the next video.

169
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,950
I will see
