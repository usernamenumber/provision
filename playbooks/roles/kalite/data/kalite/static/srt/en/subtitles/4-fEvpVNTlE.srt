1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
   

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:07,180
Let's say we had the reaction
molecule A plus molecule B is

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,260
in dynamic equilibrium with
molecules C plus D.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,550
Which just means that the rate
of the forward reaction is

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,840
going at the same rate as the
backward reaction, or the

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,740
reverse reaction.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,510
There will be some equilibrium
concentrations of A, B, C, and

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,320
D, and we can figure out
what the equilibrium

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,580
constant is if we want.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,730
And I'll say it again.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,710
I've said it like four
times so far.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,840
The fact that the forward
reaction rate is the same as

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,150
the backward reaction rate
doesn't mean that all of the

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,350
concentrations are the same.

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,980
The concentrations themselves of
each of the molecules could

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,090
be very different.

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,500
They're just not changing
anymore because the forward

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,960
and backward rates
are the same.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,070
Now, given this, given that
we're at equilibrium now,

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,140
what's going to happen if I
add more A to the system?

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,100
So remember, it was
in equilibrium.

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,400
The concentrations
were constant.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,410
But now all of a sudden, I'm
adding more A to the system.

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,750
So now, the odds of an A and a
B particle, even though I'm

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,520
not adding any more B molecule
to the system, the odds are

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,910
slightly higher that an A and
a B are going to collide in

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,580
just the right way, so the
forward reaction is going to

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,570
be more likely.

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,585
So if we add more A to the
system, you're going

30
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:20,440
to have more A's.

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,850
They're going to bump with
more B's, so the B's are

32
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,510
actually going to go down
a little bit, right?

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,250
Because more B's are going
to be consumed.

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,960
And even more important, the
C's and D's are going to

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,100
definitely be increased.

36
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,360
And the way it would really
happen, you would add more A.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Those A's would bump into some
more B's, and so this forward

38
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,570
reaction, all of a sudden, it's
rate would go faster than

39
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,650
this backward reaction.

40
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,540
So the reaction would go
in that direction.

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,590
Then you would have more C's
and D's and maybe some of

42
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,810
those are more likely to bump
and go back in this direction.

43
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,960
Eventually, you would reach
a new equilibrium.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,330
But the bottom line is you'll be
left with more A, a little

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,810
bit less B because you
didn't add more B.

46
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,820
So more B's going to be used
to consume with those extra

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,960
A's you just added.

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,580
And then those are going to
produce more C's and D's in

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,539
equilibrium.

50
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,440
And you can imagine, if you
added more A and more B, let's

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,390
say if you added more B as well,
then the reaction is

52
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,450
going to go in the forward
direction even more.

53
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,350
I don't think this is an amazing
insight of the world.

54
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,440
I think this is kind of obvious,
that if you stress

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,910
this reaction by adding more on
this side, that naturally

56
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,170
it's going to move in
the direction that

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,610
relieves the stress.

58
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,010
So if you add more A, you're
going to have more A's bumping

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,260
with B's and go in that
direction and maybe consume a

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,140
little bit more B's.

61
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,220
If you add more of both, the
whole thing's going to go in

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,820
that direction.

63
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,730
Likewise-- let me rewrite
the reaction.

64
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,610
I'll do it in a different
color.

65
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,650
A plus B, dynamic equilibrium,
C plus D.

66
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:04,380
If I add more C-- I think you
get the point here-- what's

67
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,420
going to happen?

68
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,640
Well, that's going to drive A
and B up, and it's maybe going

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,990
to consume a little
bit extra D.

70
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,400
And then if you added more C and
D, then, of course, it's

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,940
going to produce a
lot more A and B.

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,920
And this idea, it seems pretty
common sense, but there's a

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,170
fancy name for it, and it's
called Le-- let me put a

74
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,315
capital L-- Chatelier's
principle.

75
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:36,010
   

76
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,910
If you've watched enough of
these videos, you know I have

77
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,620
to be careful with
my spelling.

78
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,540
And all it says is that when you
stress a reaction that's

79
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,330
in equilibrium, the reaction
will favor the side or one

80
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,270
side of the reaction to
relieve that stress.

81
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,290
When they say stress the
reaction, that's like adding

82
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,780
more A, so the reaction's going
to move towards the

83
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,490
forward direction to relieve
the stress-- the quote,

84
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,860
unquote stress--
of that more A.

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,890
I mean, that's not stress in
its traditional way of

86
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,800
thinking about stress, but
that is a kind of stress.

87
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,140
You're somehow changing
it relative to it.

88
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,290
It was nice and comfortable
before in a nice, stable

89
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,180
environment.

90
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,870
So given Le Chatelier's
principle, let's think of some

91
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,579
other situations.

92
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:28,620
Let's say if I had A plus B
plus some heat, and that

93
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,490
produces some C plus D.

94
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,030
And maybe it produces
some E as well.

95
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,200
So if I were to add
heat to this

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,850
system, what would happen?

97
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,440
   

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,870
So in order for the reaction
to progress in the forward

99
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,260
direction, you need heat.

100
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,460
The more heat you have, the more
likely you're going to

101
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,270
progress in the forward
direction.

102
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,620
So Le Chatelier's principle will
say we're stressing this

103
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,540
reaction by adding heat, so the
reaction will favor the

104
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,870
direction that relieves
that stressor.

105
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,650
And so to relieve that stressor,
you have more of

106
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,250
this input, so you're going
to consume more A.

107
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,520
So the stable concentration of
A once we reach equilibrium

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,460
will go down.

109
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,240
B will go down because they're
going to be consumed more.

110
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,420
The forward reaction
is happening more.

111
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,410
And then C, D, and
E would go up.

112
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,210
Now, if you did the opposite.

113
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,280
Let me erase what I just did.

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's say instead of adding
heat, you were

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,790
to take away heat.

116
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,346
So let's say you were
to take away heat.

117
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,080
Let me make sure my
cursor's right.

118
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,820
So if you took heat away
from the reaction,

119
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,270
what will be favored?

120
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,240
Well, then you're going to be
favoring it in the other

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,590
direction because there'll
be less heat here.

122
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,660
I mean, all of this
is together.

123
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,090
There'll be less heat for this
reaction to occur, so this

124
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,300
rate will start dominating this
rate over here, right?

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,520
If you take away heat, the rate
of this reaction will

126
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,040
slow down, this one will be
bigger, and so you'll have

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,090
more movement of concentration
in that direction, or the

128
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,360
reverse reaction will
be favored.

129
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,880
Now, let's think of another
stressor-- pressure.

130
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,610
Now, imagine that we had-- we
mentioned the Haber process

131
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,410
before, and this
is the reaction

132
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,480
for the Haber process.

133
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:31,590
Nitrogen gas plus 3 moles of
hydrogen gas in equilibrium

134
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,890
with 2 moles of ammonia gas.

135
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,560
Now, what's going to
happen if I apply

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,140
pressure to this system?

137
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,925
I'm going to apply pressure.

138
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:46,720
   

139
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,840
So if you think about what
happens with pressure,

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,130
everything all of a sudden is
getting squeezed, although the

141
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,370
volume isn't necessarily
decreasing, but something is

142
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,220
somehow making all the molecules
want to be or

143
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,410
forcing them to be
closer together.

144
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,440
Now, when things are getting
closer together, the stress of

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,450
the pressure could be
relieved if we end

146
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,890
up with fewer molecules.

147
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,140
Think about it this way.

148
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,380
   

149
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,610
PV is equal to nRT.

150
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,810
We learned this multiple
times, right?

151
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,960
And let's say we could write
P is equal to nRT/V.

152
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,300
Now, if we increase
the pressure, how

153
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,820
can we relieve that?

154
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,600
Remember, Le Chatelier's
principle says that whatever's

155
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,140
going to happen is going to
relieve the stressor.

156
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,660
The reaction is going to
go in the direction

157
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,460
that it relieves it.

158
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,410
Well, if we lower the number of
molecules, then that will

159
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,580
relieve the pressure, right?

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,970
You'll have fewer things
bouncing against each other.

161
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,000
So if we lower the number of
molecules where you can kind

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,680
of view it-- I mean, I shouldn't
have written it this

163
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,000
way, because it's not quite an
equation, but I want you to

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,530
think of it that way.

165
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,490
Let me erase this.

166
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,280
This probably wasn't
the best intuition.

167
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,290
   

168
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,610
If I have a container--
nope, too shocking.

169
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,316
If I-- nope, same thing.

170
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:22,710
If I have a container and I'm
applying pressure to it, and

171
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:29,220
in one option I could have 2
molecules-- let's say I could

172
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,309
have 4 molecules
in some volume.

173
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,140
And in another situation, let's
say they get merged and

174
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,299
I only have 2 molecules,
right?

175
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,710
In either of these, the reaction
can go between these,

176
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,360
these 4 could merge to
make 2 molecules.

177
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,540
Actually, let me use this
example up here.

178
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,100
Let's say this nitrogen
molecule is

179
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,150
this blue one here.

180
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,420
Actually, let me do it in
a more different color.

181
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,570
This brown one right here, it
can merge with 3 hydrogen.

182
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,980
It could produce this.

183
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,750
So this is another way of
writing this reaction, maybe

184
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,440
in a more visual way.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,070
Now, if I'm applying pressure,
if I'm applying pressure to

186
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,490
this system, so pressure I just
imagine is kind of more

187
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,220
force per area from every
direction, which of these

188
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,880
situations is more likely to
relieve the situation?

189
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,390
Well, the situation where we
have fewer molecules bumping

190
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,720
around because it's easier to
kind of apply or I guess

191
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,590
squeeze them together than when
you have more molecules

192
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,540
bumping around.

193
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,310
I'm doing this very hand
wavy, but I think it

194
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,170
gives you the intuition.

195
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,410
So if you apply pressure to the
system, if pressure goes

196
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,120
up, you're applying-- this
doesn't mean the

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,760
pressure goes down.

198
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,820
This means pressure is applying
to the system.

199
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,350
But the pressure is going up,
what side of the reaction is

200
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,030
going to be favored?

201
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,190
The reaction's going to be
favoring the side of that has

202
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,600
fewer molecules.

203
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,330
And this side has 2 molecules,
although they'll be bigger

204
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,430
molecules obviously, because
it's not like we're losing

205
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,890
mass in one direction or the
other, as opposed to this

206
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,830
situation where we have
4 molecules, right?

207
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,830
1 mole of nitrogen gas and
3 moles of hydrogen.

208
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,550
And just to bring this all back
to the whole idea that we

209
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,650
saw earlier with the kinetic
equilibrium, let's just

210
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,070
imagine a reaction like this.

211
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,000
And to show that it works with
Le Chatelier's principle is

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,140
consistent with everything
we've learned

213
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,045
with equilibrium constants.

214
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:27,960
So let's say we had the reaction
2 moles, or the

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,850
coefficient of two, 2 A's in the
gaseous form plus B in the

216
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:38,860
gaseous form is in equilibrium
with C in the gaseous form.

217
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,170
And let's say initially where
our first equilibrium, our

218
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,680
concentration of A is 2 molar,
or our molarity is 2, our

219
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,880
concentration of B is 6 molar
concentration, and then our

220
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,470
concentration of C is 8 molar.

221
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,972
So what's the equilibrium
constant here?

222
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:08,250
The equilibrium constant here is
the product, concentration

223
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,960
of C, that's 8 molar divided by
2 molar squared, because of

224
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,070
this, 2 squared times 6.

225
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:25,720
Which is equal to 8/24,
which is equal to 1/3.

226
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,290
Now, let's say we were to add
more A, and I'm not going to

227
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,190
say exactly how much.

228
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,940
We could actually get quite
complicated with the

229
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,030
mathematics, but let's say after
adding more A, we have a

230
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,360
new concentration.

231
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,940
Now, let's say our concentration
of A is 3 molar.

232
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,310
You might say, hey, Sal,
didn't you add 1 molar?

233
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,030
No.

234
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,140
I actually added probably
more than 1 molar.

235
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,560
What happens is, whatever I
added, that'll push the

236
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,010
reaction towards the right
direction, or towards the

237
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,800
forward direction, and so some
of it will get consumed and go

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,150
in that direction, but
whatever's left over is here.

239
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,040
So I might have added more than
1 molar concentration to

240
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,160
this system.

241
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,650
But whatever was extra beyond
the 1 was consumed, and I'm

242
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,350
just left with this equilibrium

243
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,410
concentration of 3.

244
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,840
So I didn't necessarily add 1.

245
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,180
I could've added
more than that.

246
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:22,160
And let's say that our new
equilibrium for C is 12 molar,

247
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
which is consistent
with what we say.

248
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,640
We should be producing-- if
we add some A, then our

249
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,860
concentration of C should go up,
and the intuition is that

250
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,160
the concentration of B should go
down a little bit, because

251
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,280
a little bit more B is going to
be consumed, because it's

252
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,740
going to be colliding with-- or
it's more likely to collide

253
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,090
with-- more A particles
or A molecules.

254
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,790
So let's see what B's new
concentration is.

255
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,730
So remember, the equilibrium
constant stays constant.

256
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,540
So our equilibrium constant is
now going to be equal to the

257
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,120
concentration of C, right?

258
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,150
That was the reaction.

259
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,070
So it's 12 molar-- whoops-- I
don't have to write the units

260
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,920
here-- divided by our new
concentration of A, that's 3.

261
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,020
But remember the reaction.

262
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,710
The coefficient on A is 2.

263
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,880
So it's 3 squared times the new

264
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,950
concentration for B, right?

265
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,770
There's no coefficient here so
I don't have to worry about

266
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,220
any exponents.

267
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,260
And let's just solve this.

268
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,990
So you get 1/3 is equal
to 12 over 9B.

269
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,250
So if we just cross-multiply,
we get 9 times the

270
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:45,370
concentration of B is equal to
3 times 12, which is 36.

271
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,170
And so divide both sides by 9.

272
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,450
The new concentration of
B is 4, or 4 molar.

273
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,880
So B is equal to 4 molar.

274
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
So that makes sense.

275
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,440
We added some more A
to the reaction.

276
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,380
So we started with 2 molar of A,
6 molar of B, 8 molar of C.

277
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,180
When we added more A, at the
end, we added a bunch.

278
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,340
It went in that direction, maybe
it went back and forth a

279
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,240
little bit, but it stabilized
at 3 molar of A, 12 molar of

280
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,200
C, so C went up, so that
definitely went up.

281
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,250
And notice, our stable
equilibrium concentration of B

282
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,630
actually went down, and this
is consistent with what we

283
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,140
were saying, that the reaction
moves in that direction, more

284
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,050
C gets produced, a little
bit of B gets consumed.

285
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,850
So anyway, hopefully you're
fairly comfortable now with

286
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,870
the whole notion of stressing
a reaction and

287
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,520
Le Chatelier's principle.

288
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,667
