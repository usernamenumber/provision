1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Let's say I've got
some subspace, v,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,590
that's a plane in R3.

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,050
So let me see if I can draw
it respectably well.

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,130
Let me draw some plane in R3.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,950
Maybe it looks something
like that.

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,256
That is my subspace.

8
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:18,340
I think that's good enough.

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,580
Let me see if I can draw it a
little bit better than that.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,710
There you go.

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,240
So that is my plane in R3.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,280
This is v.

13
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,530
This is a subspace.

14
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,230
   

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,550
And let's say that I have
some other vector, x,

16
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,845
any vector in R3.

17
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,970
So my vector x looks
like this.

18
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,570
That is my vector x.

19
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,430
Now what I want to show you
in this video is that the

20
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,770
projection of x onto our
subspace-- and let's say that

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,050
this is our 0 vector
right there.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,880
I want to show you that the
projection of x onto our

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,240
subspace is the closest vector
in our subspace to x.

24
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,840
So let me draw that out,
and maybe it'll make

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,790
a little more sense.

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,150
So the projection of x on to
the subspace will look

27
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,610
something like this.

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,220
It will look something
like that.

29
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,320
That right there, that green
vector right there, is the

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,010
projection of the vector
x onto our subspace v.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,200
That's our vector x.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,600
Now, let's take some arbitrary
other vector in our subspace.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,800
Let's just take this one.

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,690
This is just some
other arbitrary

35
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,390
vector in our subspace.

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,250
Let me draw a little
bit differently.

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,280
We draw it like that.

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Let's call that vector v.

39
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,400
That's clearly another vector
on our subspace.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,970
It lies on that plane.

41
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:48,490
What I want to show you is that
the distance from x to

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,875
our projection of x on to v is
shorter than the distance from

43
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,270
x to any other vector.

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,290
From the distance from x
to any other vector.

45
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,480
And obviously, the way I've
drawn it, it looks pretty

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,810
clear that this line is shorter
than that line.

47
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,430
But that was just a particular
choice that I picked.

48
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,830
Let's prove it that's general.

49
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,139
So what I want to prove is that
the distance between x

50
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,560
and its projection onto the
subspace-- and the way we can

51
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,750
get that is essentially just
take the length of the vector

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,920
of x minus the projection
of x onto my subspace.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,220
This length right here is this
length right here, is this

54
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,260
length right here.

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,180
So x minus the projection of x
onto v, that's going to be

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,690
this vector right there.

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,460
Let me do that in a
different color.

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,230
Don't want to reuse
colors too often.

59
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,430
That's going to be that
vector right there.

60
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,200
We could call that vector a.

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,190
It's clearly in the orthogonal
complement of v, because it's

62
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,150
orthogonal to this guy.

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,433
And that's the definition of a
projection, actually, so this

64
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:59,760
is equal to a.

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,020
My claim, what I want to show
you, is that this distance a

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:13,610
is shorter than any distance
here, is less than or equal to

67
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,800
the distance between x and
v, where v is any member.

68
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,270
So that's this distance,
right here.

69
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,960
This vector right here, that
distance right-- let me draw

70
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,936
this vector.

71
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:27,270
The vector x minus v
looks like this.

72
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,350
It looks like that.

73
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,850
That is the vector
x minus v, right?

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,330
If you take v plus x minus v,
you're going to go to x.

75
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,730
So what I want to show is that
this distance, the length of

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,810
a, of the difference between x
and its projection, is always

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,880
going to be less than the
distance between x and any

78
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,000
other vector in the subspace.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,450
So that is x minus v.

80
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,830
So let's see if we
can prove that.

81
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,260
So let's take the square
of this distance.

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,230
So the square of x-- actually,
let me do that.

83
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,180
Yeah, let me write that way.

84
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,420
So we want to concern ourselves
with the square of

85
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,320
the distance of x minus v, where
x is some vector in R3,

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,970
and v is some vector
in R3 that's also a

87
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,959
member of our subspace.

88
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,959
It sits on this plane.

89
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,650
So what's the square of
this going to be?

90
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:29,250
Well, x minus v is equal
to this vector.

91
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,430
Let me draw a new vector here.

92
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,780
It is equal to this--
wait, let me draw

93
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,130
it in in this yellow.

94
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,480
It's equal to this vector.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,600
It's equal to this yellow
vector plus a.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Right? x minus v is-- this
magenta vector that starts

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
here and goes there-- clearly
equal to this yellow vector

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,040
plus this orange vector.

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,570
So let me call that
yellow vector b.

100
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,430
Now, what is b equal to?

101
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:07,120
Well, b is going to be equal
to this vector, this green

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,540
vector, which is the projection
of x onto v, minus

103
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,620
this purple vector.

104
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,480
Minus this mauve vector,
I guess.

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,340
Minus v.

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,840
That's what b is.

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,630
So we could write x minus v as
being equal to the sum of the

108
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:33,405
vector b plus the vector a.

109
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,356
   

110
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:39,830
So x minus v is equal
to b plus a.

111
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,450
And if we're taking the length
of x minus v squared, that's

112
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,500
the same thing as the length
of b plus a squared.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:57,460
And that's just equal to b plus
a dotted with b plus a,

114
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,660
which is the same thing
as b dot b.

115
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,190
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

116
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,540
Let me write it down here.

117
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,980
This is going to be equal to,
I'll switch colors, b dot b.

118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,270
Right, b dot b plus b
dot a plus a dot b.

119
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,580
So plus 2 times a dot
b, plus a dot a.

120
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,470
   

121
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,110
Now, a and b are clearly
orthogonal.

122
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,040
b is the difference between two
vectors in our subspace.

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,070
The subspace is closed under
addition and subraction.

124
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,360
So b is a member of
our subspace.

125
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,790
a is orthogonal to everything
in our subspace, by

126
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,740
definition.

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,040
So since a is clearly orthogonal
to b, a is-- by

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,380
definition-- going to be in the
orthogonal compliment of

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,210
the subspace.

130
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,760
This is going to be 0.

131
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,600
And then this right here
will simplify to

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,010
the length of b squared.

133
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,420
And then this right here
is going to be plus

134
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,950
the length of a squared.

135
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,540
So we get the distance between x
and some arbitrary member of

136
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,860
our subspace squared is equal
to the length of b, right

137
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,580
here, plus the length
of a squared.

138
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,800
Now, a was a distance between
our vector x and our

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,050
projection, right?

140
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,040
That's what the definition of
a was. a was the distance

141
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,100
between our vector x
and our projection.

142
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,060
Now, this number right
here is going to be

143
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,410
at least 0 or positive.

144
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,440
So this right here is definitely
going to be greater

145
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,710
than or equal to a squared.

146
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:51,200
Or another way to say it is that
the distance between x

147
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,950
minus v squared is definitely
going to be greater than or

148
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,050
equal to the distance
of a squared.

149
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,570
Or the distance between x minus
v-- this is still going

150
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,910
to be a positive quantity,
length is always going to be

151
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,950
positive-- is greater
than or equal to the

152
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,680
length of vector a.

153
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,620
Or what's that length of vector
a? a is just this thing

154
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,070
right here.

155
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,280
So let's write our result.

156
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,170
The length of the vector x
minus v, or the distance

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,440
between x and some arbitrary
member of our subspace, is

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,240
always going to be greater than
or equal to the length of

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,289
a, which is just the distance
between x and the projection

160
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,730
of x onto our subspace.

161
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,890
So there you have it.

162
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,740
We've shown, and the original
graph kind of hinted at it,

163
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,530
that the projection of x onto v
is the closest vector in our

164
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,850
subspace to x.

165
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,310
It's closer than any other
vector in v to our arbitrary

166
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,855
vector in R3, x.

167
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:04,300
And we've proven
it right there.
