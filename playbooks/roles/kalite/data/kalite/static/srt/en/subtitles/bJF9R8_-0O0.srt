1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:03,083
Are line segment AB

2
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,739
and line segment CD congruent?

3
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,936
So let's look at these right over QQ

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,849
AB is this line segment right over here.

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,898
And CD is this one right over here.

6
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:16,235
AB has length of 1.

7
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,668
It goes from 2 to 3.

8
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:20,066
And CD has length of 1.

9
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:21,273
It goes from 4 to 5.

10
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:22,982
So they they have the exact same length.

11
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,978
These are just line segments 
with the exact same length.

12
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:27,658
So yes, they are congruent.

13
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:28,349
Yes.

14
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,837
Let's do a couple more.

15
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:32,933
Are a AB and CD congruent?

16
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:33,704
So AB â€“

17
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,137
And you can just eyeball this.

18
00:00:35,137 --> 00:00:37,159
AB is much longer the CD.

19
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,473
AB is of length 4.

20
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,205
it goes from -5 to -1.

21
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,802
CD is only of length 1.

22
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:45,335
It goes from 1 to 2..

23
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,891
So no. They are not congruent..

24
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,595
They have different lengths.

25
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:51,858
Let's do one more.

26
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:52,131
Are AB and CD congruent?

27
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,280
Let's see. AB has length 2.

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,720
It goes from -1 to 1.

29
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,160
CD is of length 3.

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,600
So they're not congruent. No.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
