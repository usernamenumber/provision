1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,840
So I've got four Cartesian
coordinates here.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,770
This first one is minus 1, 0.

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,440
I tried to draw them
ahead of time.

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,230
So minus 1, 0 is this
point right there.

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,510
Doing this in these
new colors.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,360
The next point is
a 0, 1, which is

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,000
that point right there.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Then the next point is
1, 2, which is that

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,320
point right up there.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,240
And then the last point is 2, 1,
which is that point there.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,310
Now my goal in this video is to
find some line, y equals mx

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,040
plus v, that goes through
these points.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,690
Now the first thing I'd say
is, hey Sal, there is not

15
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,670
going to be any line that goes
through these points, and you

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,920
can see that immediately.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,550
You could find a line that
maybe goes through these

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,630
points, but it's not
going to go through

19
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,540
this point over here.

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,960
If you try to make a line to
goes through these two points,

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,580
it's not going to go through
those points there.

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,820
So you're not going to be able
to find a solution that goes

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,180
through those points.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,580
Let's set up the equation that
we know we can't find the

25
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,350
solution to and maybe we can
use our least squares

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,690
approximation to find a line
that almost goes through all

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,370
these points.

28
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,780
Or it's at least the best
approximation for a line that

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,420
goes through those points.

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,200
So this first one, I can
express my line, y

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,980
equals mx plus b.

32
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,430
Let me just express it as f of
x is equal to mx plus b, or y

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,740
is equal to f of x.

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,480
We can write it that way.

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,710
So our first point right there
-- let me do it in that color,

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,340
that orange -- that tells us
that f of minus 1, which is

37
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,760
equal to m times -- let me just
write this way -- minus 1

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,160
times m, it's minus m plus
b, that that is going

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,180
to be equal to 0.

40
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,550
That's what that first
equation tells us.

41
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:53,530
The second equation tells us
that f of 0, which is equal to

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,210
0 times m, which is just
0 plus b is equal to 1.

43
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,530
f of 0 is 1.

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,080
   

45
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,050
This is f of x.

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,380
The next one -- let me do it in
this yellow color -- tells

47
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:18,160
us that f of 1, which is equal
to 1 times m, or just m, plus

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,400
b, is going to be equal to 2.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,820
And then this last one down
here tells us that f of 2,

50
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,420
which is of course 2 times m
plus b, that that is going to

51
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,150
be equal to 1.

52
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,260
These are the constraints.

53
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,570
If we assume that our line can
go through all of these

54
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,690
points, then all of these
things must be true.

55
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,680
Now you could immediately, if
you wish, try to solve this

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,050
equation, but you'll find that
you won't find a solution.

57
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,420
We want to find some m's
and b's that satisfy

58
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,570
all of these equations.

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,820
Or another way of writing this
-- We want to write it as a

60
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,600
matrix vector or a
matrix equation .

61
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,530
We could write it like this.

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:19,900
Minus 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1,
times the vector mv has got to

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,340
be equal to the vector
0, 1, 2, 1.

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,770
   

65
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,330
These two systems, this system
and this system right here,

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,780
are equivalent statements,
right?

67
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,060
Minus 1 times m plus 1 times b
has got to be equal to that 0.

68
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,390
0 times m plus 1 times b has
got to be equal to that 1

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,710
That's equivalent to that
statement right here.

70
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,630
And this isn't going
to have a solution.

71
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,680
The solution would have to go
through all of those points.

72
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,870
So let's at least try to find
a least squares solution.

73
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,880
So if we call this a, if we call
that x, and let's call

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:07,780
this b, there is no solution
to ax is equal to b.

75
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,250
Now maybe we can find a least
-- Well, we can definitely

76
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,490
find a least squares solution.

77
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:20,750
So let's find our least squares
solution such that a

78
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:26,870
transpose a times our least
squares solution is equal to a

79
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,900
transpose times b.

80
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Our least squares solution
is the one that

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,020
satisfies this equation.

82
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,400
We proved it two videos ago.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,550
So let's figure out what a
transpose a is and what a

84
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,400
transpose b is, and
then we can solve.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,700
So a transpose will
look like this.

86
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,670
b minus 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,
1, and then 2, 1.

87
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,920
This first column becomes this
first row; this second column

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,850
becomes this second row.

89
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,270
So we're going to take the
product of a transpose and

90
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:04,870
then a-- a is that thing right
there --minus 1, 0, 1, 2, and

91
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,270
we just get a bunch of 1's.

92
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,500
So what does this equal to?

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,250
We have a 2 by 4
times a 4 by 2.

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,860
So we're going to have
a 2 by 2 matrix.

95
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,220
So this is going to be --
Let's do it this way.

96
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,390
Well, we're going to have minus
1 times minus 1, which

97
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,940
is 1, plus 0 times 0, which is
0 -- so we're at 1 right now

98
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,520
--plus 1 times 1.

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,230
So that's 1 plus the other
1 up there, so that's 2,

100
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,180
plus 2 times 2.

101
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,170
2 times 2 is 4, so we get 6.

102
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,630
   

103
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,340
That's that row, dotted with
that column, was equal to 6.

104
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,030
Now let's take this row dotted
with this column.

105
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,143
So it's going to be negative 1
times 1, plus 0 times 1, so

106
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,910
all of these guys times
1 plus each other.

107
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,350
So minus 1 plus 0 plus 1 --
that's all 0's --plus 2.

108
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,700
So it's going to get a 2.

109
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,600
I just dotted that guy
with that guy.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,170
Now I need to take the dot of
this guy with this column.

111
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,890
So it's just going to be 1 times
minus 1 plus 1 times 0

112
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,580
plus 1 times 1 plus 1 times 2.

113
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,090
Well, these are all 1 times
everything, so it's minus 1

114
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,185
plus 0 plus 1, which
is 0 plus 2.

115
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,160
It's going to be 2.

116
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,300
And then finally -- Well.

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,360
I mean, I think you see
some symmetry here.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,040
We're going to have to take the
dot of this guy and this

119
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,340
guy over here.

120
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,900
So what is that?

121
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,930
That's 1 times 1, which is 1,
plus 1 times 1, which is 2,

122
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,400
plus 1 times 1.

123
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,450
So we're going to have 1
plus itself four times.

124
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,900
So we're going to get that
it's equal to 4.

125
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,650
So this is a transpose a.

126
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,270
And let's figure out what a
transpose b looks like.

127
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,970
Scroll down a little bit.

128
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:55,220
So a transpose is this matrix
again-- let me switch colors

129
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,900
--minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,160
We get all of our 1's
just like that.

131
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,530
And then the matrix
b is 0, 1, 2, 1.

132
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,730
   

133
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,490
We have a 2 by 4 times a 4 by 1,
so we're just going to get

134
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,890
a 2 by 1 matrix.

135
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,510
So this is going to be equal
to a 2 by 1 matrix.

136
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,030
We have here, let's see, minus 1
times 0 is 0, plus 0 times 1

137
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,440
is still 0.

138
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,100
Plus 1 times 2, which
is 2, plus 2 times

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,590
1, which is 4, right?

140
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,560
This is 2 plus 2, so it's going
to be 4 right there.

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,510
And then we have 1 times 0, plus
1 times 2, plus-- So 1

142
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,240
times all of these
guys added up.

143
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,630
So 0 plus 1 is 1, 1 plus
2 is 3, 3 plus 1 is 4.

144
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,400
So this right here
is a transpose b.

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,800
So just like that, we know
that the least squares

146
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,080
solution will be the solution
to this system.

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:08,460
6, 2, 2, 4, times our least
squares solution, is going to

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,830
be equal to 4, 4.

149
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,300
Or we could write it this way.

150
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,250
We could write it 6, 2, 2, 4,
times our least squares

151
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,020
solution, which I'll write--
Remember, the

152
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,310
first entry was m .

153
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,620
I'll write it as m star.

154
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,130
That's our least square m, and
this is our least square b, is

155
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,220
equal to 4, 4.

156
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,159
And I can do this as an
augmented matrix or I could

157
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,110
just write this as a system
of two unknowns, which is

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,760
actually probably easier.

159
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,700
So let's do it that way.

160
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,200
So this, if I were to write it
as a system of equations, is 6

161
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:51,540
times m star plus 2 times
b star, is equal to 4.

162
00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:00,120
And then I get 2 times m star
plus 4 times b star is

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,830
equal to this 4.

164
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,950
So let me solve for my m
stars and my b stars.

165
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,320
So let's multiply this second
equation, actually let's

166
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,570
multiply that top
equation by 2.

167
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,280
This is just straight
Algebra 1.

168
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,300
So times 2, what do we get?

169
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,970
We get 12m star plus 4b
star is equal to 8.

170
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,560
We just multiplied that
top guy by 2.

171
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:35,930
Now let's multiply this magenta
1 by negative 1.

172
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,200
So this becomes a minus, this
becomes a minus, that becomes

173
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,370
a minus, and now we can add
these two equations.

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,490
So we get minus 2 plus 12m
star, that's 10m star.

175
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,700
And then the minus 4b and the 4b
cancel out, is equal to 4,

176
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,000
or m star is equal to 4 over
10, which is equal to 2/5.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,320
Now we can just go and
back-substitute into this.

178
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,450
We can say 6 times m
star-- This is just

179
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,990
straight Algebra 1.

180
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,430
So 6 times our m star, so 6
times 2 over 5, plus 2 times

181
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,410
our b star is equal to 4.

182
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,170
Enough white, let
me use yellow.

183
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:27,760
So we get 12 over 5 plus 2b
star is equal to 4, or we

184
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,050
could say 2b star-- let me
scroll down a little bit --2b

185
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,580
star is equal to 4.

186
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,350
Which is the same thing as 20
over 5, minus 12 over 5, which

187
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,970
is equal to-- I'm just
subtracting the 12 over 5 from

188
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,180
both sides --which is
equal to 8 over 5.

189
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,160
And you divide both sides of the
equation by 2, you get b

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,220
star is equal to 4/5.

191
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,940
And just like that, we got our
m star and our b star.

192
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:07,770
Our least squares solution
is equal to 2/5 and 4/5.

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,900
So m is equal to 2/5 and
b is equal to 4/5.

194
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,030
And remember, the whole point
of this was to find an

195
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,810
equation of the line.

196
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,890
y is equal to mx plus b.

197
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,500
Now we can't find a line that
went through all of those

198
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,240
points up there, but this
is going to be our

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,610
least squares solution.

200
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,580
This is the one that minimizes
the distance between a times

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,490
our vector and b.

202
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,580
No vector, when you multiply
times that matrix a-- that's

203
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,610
not a, that's transpose a --no
other solution is going to

204
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,880
give us a closer solution to
b than when we put our

205
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
newly-found x star into
this equation.

206
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,660
This is going to give us
our best solution.

207
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,800
It's going to minimize
the distance to b.

208
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,880
So let's write it out.

209
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,640
y is equal to mx plus b.

210
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,870
So y is equal to
2/5 x plus 2/5.

211
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,590
Let's graph that out.

212
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,650
y is equal to 2/5 x plus 2/5.

213
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:15,890
   

214
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,130
So its y-intercept is 2/5,
which is about there .

215
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,200
This is at 1.

216
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,320
2/5 is right about there.

217
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,020
And then its slope is 2/5.

218
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,580
   

219
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,110
Let's think of it this way: for
every 2 and 1/2 you go to

220
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,510
the right, you're going
to go up 1.

221
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,170
So if you go 1, 2 and 1/2,
we're going to go up 1.

222
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,590
We're going to go
up 1 like that.

223
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,920
So our line-- and obviously this
isn't precise --but our

224
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
line is going to look
something like this.

225
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:54,420
   

226
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,520
I want to do my best shot
at drawing it because

227
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,260
this is the fun part.

228
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,820
It's going to look something
like that.

229
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,440
And that right there is my least
squares estimate for a

230
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,260
line that goes through
all of those points.

231
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,360
And you're not going to find a
line that minimizes the error

232
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,690
in a better way, at least when
you measure the error as the

233
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:20,150
distance between this vector
and the vector a times our

234
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,180
least squares estimate.

235
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,740
Anyway, thought you would
find that neat.
