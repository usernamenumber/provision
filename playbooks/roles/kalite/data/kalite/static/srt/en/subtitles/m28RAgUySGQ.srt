1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,163
Where I left off in the last video,

2
00:00:03,163 --> 00:00:06,660
my buddies and I, we had a great idea to sell socks online.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,870
We went to an angel investor.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,960
He had originally given us $5 million.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,350
He valued what we already had at $5 million dollars.

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,503
So, since he was giving us $5 million and we had $5 million,

7
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:16,890
he got 50% of the company.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,320
And we have the other 50%.

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,060
We have two million total shares.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,495
And we took four of that million,

11
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:23,457
let's say six months have passed.

12
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,055
We hired 50 people,

13
00:00:25,055 --> 00:00:27,400
and we finally built a working version of our website.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,210
But we now are about to run out of cash.

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,060
We still haven't started selling things,

16
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,295
and we'll actually have to start selling a lot of things

17
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,470
before we have enough money to support ourselves.

18
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,010
So we need to go start raising money again.

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,750
And we also want to spend money marketing and all the rest.

20
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,170
So we go to some professional investors.

21
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,630
We'll go to seed venture capitalists,

22
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,530
and we're going to do our Series A round of funding.

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,670
Which just means our first kind of

24
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,500
professional venture capital round of funding.

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,120
We finally-- some guy finds a team that, they like us.

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,270
And we start getting to the negotiation.

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,354
They say, you know what?

28
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:00,100
You guys say you need $10 million.

29
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,820
We believe you.

30
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,680
We know that that's what it takes

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,740
and we think you have a good business.

32
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,155
So, let's see, let me say that we need to raise $10 million.

33
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,450
Just so I make that clear.

34
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,035
We need it for ongoing expenses.

35
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:15,410
And of course we'll have a big business plan and everything

36
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,280
that further fleshes this out.

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,164
And we also have need--

38
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,430
we're going to do some marketing, et cetera, et cetera.

39
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,270
So they say, you know, we have $10 million

40
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,322
and we think this is a hot space,

41
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,928
because we know those other VC's across the street

42
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:35,310
also invested in an online undergarment play.

43
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,400
And we know that that's the hot thing right now.

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,122
So we're also going to do it.

45
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:43,153
So the question now is,

46
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,984
what do they get for their $10 million.

47
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:46,630
So once again we get into this

48
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,880
what is the company worth right now?

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,932
So once again, they're going to do a pre-money valuation.

50
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:56,520
So what is this whole thing worth right now?

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,870
So they'll say, the idea's good.

52
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,500
They won't break down.

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,940
They won't say oh, the idea is worth $5 million.

54
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,130
But the general idea is, hopefully, from that stage

55
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,730
where the post-money valuation was $10 million, right?

56
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,090
Back here it was $10 million.

57
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,100
Then we did a bunch of work.

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,510
We used some of this $5 million.

59
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,580
We did a bunch of work.

60
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,220
Hopefully we added value.

61
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,640
If we added value, our value of this stuff now, this--

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,910
we turned this cash into other types of assets like a website

63
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,640
and other things, and knowledge in our firm,

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
and expertise, and all that stuff.

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,342
Hopefully now, what we have here

66
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,110
is worth more than $10 million, right?

67
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,420
Otherwise we kind of destroyed wealth.

68
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,510
And all of this is very intangible.

69
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,980
It's very hard for someone to really place a value on things

70
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,940
at this point.

71
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,090
A lot of VC's, they kind of swing for the fences.

72
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,890
They're like, you know what, these guys have a 10% chance

73
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,965
of being worth a billion dollars,

74
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,760
and a 90% of being worth 0.

75
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,922
If I make 10 of these bets,

76
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:02,990
at least one of them is going to pay off and make my whole fund.

77
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,623
And so that's how they kind of think.

78
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:07,220
So at this level, they'll do some hard negotiating.

79
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,010
But it often times is going to--not at this level,

80
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,863
this is where we are right now--

81
00:03:11,863 --> 00:03:14,150
it's kind of what other people got for this stage of a company.

82
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,120
They say oh, you know,

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,460
you have a pretty good built-up website.

84
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,080
Those other guys who had a pretty good built-up website

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,430
at this point, those guys across the street,

86
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,280
they had to pay-- they had to give a $20 million pre-money valuation.

87
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,145
But you know, you guys are a little bit--

88
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,240
your market isn't quite as big as the broader undergarments market.

89
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,520
You're just socks.

90
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,580
So the opportunity isn't as big.

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,290
So we'll give you a $15 million pre-money valuation.

92
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,580
So they're saying that what we have right now

93
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,400
is worth $15 million.

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,910
And that's pretty good.

95
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,300
If that were reality, if it really is worth $15 million,

96
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,660
then what are our shares worth right now?

97
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,830
Notice, they haven't given us any money.

98
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,790
This is the pre-money valuation.

99
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,770
So $15 million divided by two million shares, right?

100
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,990
That's how many we have right now.

101
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,080
So what is the value per share?

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,790
15 million divided by 2 is $7.50 per share.

103
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,010
That's pretty good.

104
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,180
Because back here-- remember, this is kind of a scenario that didn't happen,

105
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,500
that was kind of a negative scenario--

106
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,590
but back here when the pre-money was $5 million for a million shares,

107
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,340
it was $5 per share.

108
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,140
Then it became $10 million for two million shares,

109
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,560
still $5 per share.

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,709
But before and after this round,

111
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,940
that angel said oh, your shares are worth about $5 per share.

112
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,070
Now this VC, who is a professional investor

113
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,670
and has teams of MBA's making spreadsheets for him, says that

114
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,515
actually, what we have right here is

115
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,540
worth $7.50 a share.

116
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,994
So just over those six months

117
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:51,340
we actually got a 50% return on our shares, if you believe that.

118
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,990
And the angel investor's happy.

119
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,120
He feels good about it.

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,220
This was vindication for his bet on us.

121
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,040
So we feel good.

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,620
We feel like we've given him,

123
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,160
at least in the short term, a return.

124
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,370
So anyway, we get a $15 million pre-money valuation.

125
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,670
And I'll let you think about this one.

126
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,460
What's the post-money valuation?

127
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,762
What happens when you layer on

128
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:17,735
the $10 million from this venture firm?

129
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:21,662
Actually, just to make the math simple,

130
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:25,580
let's say that we're raising 7.5 million.

131
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,960
Let's say that we wanted 10 million,

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,250
but we were hoping for 20 million pre-money valuation,

133
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,530
because that's what the other guys got.

134
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,830
And since they're only giving us a $15 million pre-money,

135
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,570
we just don't want to take as many shares from them,

136
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,100
because we don't want to give as much of the company away.

137
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,000
So we're just going to take $7.5 million,

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,120
because we think that's just enough that we need to keep going.

139
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
So we do that.

140
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:55,200
We take $7.5 million from this seed venture capitalist.

141
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,450
And he essentially valued our old shares at $7.50 per share.

142
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,820
So, for $7.5 million at $7.50 per share,

143
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,890
he should get another million shares.

144
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,760
So what we're going to do--

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,724
this angel investor is probably sitting on our board now

146
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:12,254
because he owns so many of the shares.

147
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,917
The board of directors of a firm is

148
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,490
essentially elected by the shareholders.

149
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,122
So if you have 50% of the shares,

150
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:19,190
you can put yourself on the board.

151
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,950
You could probably put some other people

152
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,660
on the board of directors as well.

153
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,390
So, we had two million.

154
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,360
These guys get a million.

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,770
How many shares do we have now?

156
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,160
We now will have three million shares.

157
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,960
So we had to issue another million shares.

158
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
And what is our post-money valuation?

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Pre-money was 15.

160
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,050
We have $7.5 million now.

161
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,730
Our post-money valuation is $22.5 million.

162
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,290
And now, what percentage do each of us own?

163
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,230
So the angel investor owns one million,

164
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,740
not out of two million shares like he used to.

165
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,540
He now owns one million out of three million shares.

166
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,520
So now he owns 30%.

167
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,960
The seed VC, he has a million out of three million,

168
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,930
so he owns-- well this is 33 and 1/3%--

169
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,700
the seed VC owns 33 and 1/3%.

170
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,170
And then me and my buddies, we collectively own 33 and 1/3%,

171
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,560
and I have 1/5 of that, so I have a little over 5%.

172
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,548
So the founders, that's us,

173
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,390
we still have about a third of the company.

174
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,740
And now we have the $7.5 million we just raised,

175
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,440
plus we have the million dollars in cash we had before.

176
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,480
We have $8.5 million to keep on going with our business.

177
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,190
Fair enough.

178
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,020
So let's say another six months go by.

179
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:49,556
So our old balance sheet-- let me draw all of the shares--

180
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,370
I want to do a couple of more rounds of financing

181
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,497
before I take the company public.

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,010
So this is my slice down here, $200,000.

183
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,690
This is the angel investor.

184
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,110
This is the seed VC.

185
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,480
And then, of course, let's say after, I don't know,

186
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
another six months we burn through the cash.

187
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,360
We've marketed the website, we have only $1 million left.

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,584
And that's usually our trigger point for

189
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:24,072
when we want to raise more money.

190
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,720
In fact we probably would have to do it at $2 million

191
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,500
because we've raised more employees, and we're burning more cash.

192
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,506
Your cash burn is essentially

193
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,507
how much cash is going out of the door every month,

194
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,200
because your business still isn't making money.

195
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,750
And of course you have all of the assets of the firm,

196
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,549
which essentially, it's a website, and offices,

197
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,020
and the knowledge, some of it intangible.

198
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,800
So, website, and everything that comes with it.

199
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,220
Your brand now, you probably have, because you've marketed.

200
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,070
So people recognize socksonline.com.

201
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,030
I don't know if that already exists so forgive me

202
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,530
if I'm actually somehow insulting a real business out there.

203
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,480
But you have a brand now.

204
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
And so you're almost ready.

205
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,650
You're actually generating revenue.

206
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,990
But you're still kind of cash flow negative.

207
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,600
You're burning less money

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,750
because people are actually going to your site.

209
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,830
They're buying stuff.

210
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,740
But you just need a little bit more money, you think,

211
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,180
to get profitable, right?

212
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,340
Once you get this amount of money, you're ready to go.

213
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,810
So you go to another VC.

214
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,190
Once again, a lot of them turn you away.

215
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,140
But one guy finally says OK, I'll give you some money.

216
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,500
And you say, you know I need $5 million.

217
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,400
He says, fair enough.

218
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,802
I'm going to value your business at--

219
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:35,352
let's say we're in an optimistic world,

220
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:36,888
so we're doing up rounds.

221
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:40,593
Up rounds are when your pre-money valuation of this round

222
00:09:40,593 --> 00:09:44,454
is more than the post-money valuation of the last round.

223
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:45,780
So the value is going up.

224
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,260
You are creating value.

225
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,700
It would be a down round-- like here,

226
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,970
they valued us at $15 million.

227
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,360
While the post-money of our last round was $10 million.

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,870
So that was an up round.

229
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,460
If these guys said no way, the world has changed.

230
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,445
We're only going to value all of this stuff at $8 million,

231
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,320
then that would be a down round,

232
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,743
and no one's happy about that.

233
00:10:06,743 --> 00:10:09,475
We'll talk about the repercussions of that in the future,

234
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,830
why down rounds aren't good.

235
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,201
So often times,

236
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,530
you actually don't want to get too good of a valuation.

237
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,310
Because if you get too good of a valuation,

238
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,177
in the next round it might be hard to get people

239
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,910
who are going to give you a better valuation.

240
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,650
You might be forced to take a down round,

241
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,260
which has negative aspects.

242
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,520
But just quick and dirty, you're a prominent brand now.

243
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,390
It's a little easier for you to raise money.

244
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,970
You go to some VC who specializes in

245
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,260
kind of helping people get to that profitability stage.

246
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,620
And what you do is you raise your Series B.

247
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,690
And just to put it simply, it's an up round.

248
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,830
Your post-money from your last round was $22.5 million,

249
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,930
right? $22.5 million.

250
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,540
You've generated some value.

251
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,140
So now they say, you know what?

252
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,310
Your business is worth $30 million.

253
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,860
And you need another $10 million

254
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:05,125
to really pump up the marketing.

255
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,000
How many shares do they get?

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,982
Well the pre-money was $30 million, we had three million shares,

257
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:14,225
so they're assigning us a value of essentially $10 a share,

258
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,125
which is great.

259
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,950
Remember the first round, the angel gave us $5 per share?

260
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,950
Second round we got $7.50 per share.

261
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,020
And now we're getting $10 per share.

262
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,300
So if we're selling him shares at $10 per share,

263
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,800
we just have to issue another million shares to get $10 million.

264
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,820
It's another million shares,

265
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,530
and this goes to VC2, the second VC.

266
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,300
And that's our Series B.

267
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,170
We raised $10 million.

268
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,870
Fair enough.

269
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,500
So we've done one round of angel investing.

270
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,880
And then we've got our Series A

271
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,760
that gave us the $7.5 million.

272
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,960
Then we did our Series B that gave us $10 million.

273
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,610
And we could keep doing this, Series C, Series D,

274
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,410
and so on and so forth.

275
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,610
And I'll continue this in the next video.
