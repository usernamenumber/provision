Find the volume of a sphere with a diameter of 14 centimeters. So if I have a sphere, so this isn't

2
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:12,516
just a circle. This is a sphere. You can view it as a globe of some kind.

3
00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:17,345
So i'm gonna shad it a little bit so you can tell it's three-dimensional. They're giving us the diameter

4
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:21,672
so if we go from on side of the sphere straight through the center of it, so we're imagining we can see

5
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:28,428
through the sphere. And we go straight through the centimeter that distance right over there is 14 centimeters.

6
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:34,995
Now, to find the volume of a sphere, we prove this or you will see a proof for this later when you learn

7
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:43,683
calculus, but the formula for the volume of a sphere is volume is equal to 4 thirds pi*r^3.

8
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:50,026
Where r is the radius of the sphere. So they 've given us the diameter and just like for circles,

9
00:00:50,026 --> 00:00:56,103
the radius of the sphere, the radius of the sphere is half the diameter.

10
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,848
So in this example, our radius is going to be 7 centimeters. In fact, the sphere itself

11
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:07,658
is the set of all points in three dimensions that is exactly the radius away from the center.

12
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:12,995
With that out of the way, let's just apply this radius being 7 centimeters to this formular right over

13
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:21,845
here. So we're going to have a volume is equal to 4 thirds pi*7. cm^3.

14
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:35,637
And, since it already involves pi, and you can approximate pi with 3.14,

15
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,927
some people even approximate it with 22/7, but we'll actually just get the calculator out

16
00:01:40,927 --> 00:01:44,626
to get the exact value for this volume. So this is going to be...

17
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:56,310
My volume is going to be 4/3...And then I don't want to just put a pi there because that might interprit it as 4 divided by 3 pi.

18
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:07,529
So four divided by three times pi times seven to the third power.

19
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:12,181
In order of operations it will do the exponent first so this should work out.

20
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:17,585
An the units are going to be in centimeters cubed or cubic centimeters.

21
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:23,314
So we get 1436, they don't tell us what to round it to so I'll just round it to the nearest tenth.

22
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:32,676
1436.8 So this is equal to 1436.8 centimeters cubed.

23
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:34,415
And we're done!
