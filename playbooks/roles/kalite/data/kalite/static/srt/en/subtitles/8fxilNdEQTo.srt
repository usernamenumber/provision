1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,220
I now want to introduce you to
the concept of leverage.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,690
And then in future videos, we'll
talk about this more in

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,030
terms of what leverage does
and when it's good

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,600
and when it's bad.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,190
We'll talk about it in a lot
of different contexts.

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,690
Right now, I'll talk about
a little bit more in the

8
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,660
context of a bank.

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,030
So let's say I start off my bank
again and I have 300 gold

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:27,355
pieces of equity and let's say
I use that for my building.

11
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:30,510
   

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,530
That was 100 gold pieces.

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,450
And then I have 200 gold pieces
that I just put into my

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,010
building just to start it off.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,890
Let's say I take a 100 gold
piece deposit, and of course I

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,970
have an offsetting checking
account that those people can

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,690
at any point use-- either to
write checks or at some point

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,700
they can come back and demand
their money back.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,235
Let's say I make out some loans
for different projects.

20
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:03,000
   

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,920
Let's say 300 gold pieces loan
A-- and I do that just by

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,640
giving Person A or Entrepreneur
A or whoever took

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,060
this loan out a 300 gold
piece checking account.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,500
Let me just do one more loan.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,970
Let's say I make another
loan for 300.

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,170
Loan B-- and I can give that.

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,050
I could have also issued notes
and all of that, but let's say

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,300
I just give them a
checking account.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,730
And we have explored reserve
requirements and all that.

30
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,290
Let's think a little
bit about leverage.

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,660
And leverage is essentially, how
much assets do you control

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,520
with a certain amount
of equity?

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,930
So in our example right now,
what is our equity?

34
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,350
   

35
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,370
Our equity is equal to
300 gold pieces.

36
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,290
Let me do it in a different
color just so the equity

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,360
stands out from the
liabilities.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,540
And how many assets are we
controlling with that 300 gold

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,750
pieces of equity?

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,020
So I have 300, 400,
700, 1,000.

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:16,060
So, assets are equal to
1,000 gold pieces.

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,200
So a lot of times people-- when
they talk about leverage,

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,550
you might hear someone
say, 2:1 leverage.

44
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,930
Well, that means the ratio
of the assets to

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,560
the equity is 2:1.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,040
In this case, the ratio of our
assets to equity-- so we have

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,790
assets to equity leverage, is
what people say-- in this

48
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,660
case, it's 1,000 to 300--
or what is it?

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,300
10:3.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,790
You seldom hear 10:3 leverage.

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,830
You'll hear people talking in
terms of 10:1 or 2:1, or

52
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,600
something to one, but 10:3
is a fair leverage ratio.

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,350
It tells you just how many
assets we're controlling with

54
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,600
a certain amount of equity.

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,360
   

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,640
I guess a very good reason why
a bank wants to do this,

57
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
because if it's making more
money on its assets than it's

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
paying on its liabilities, in
theory, a bank will want to

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,540
take on as much leverage
as possible, right?

60
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,380
Because with this original 300
investment, every time it adds

61
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,900
some assets and some
liabilities, it's going to

62
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,600
make a difference.

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,160
It's going to make the spread on
that money and so it wants

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,450
to keep doing that.

65
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,040
But there's a downside to
leverage because what if the

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,730
bank-- what if some of these
loans aren't so good?

67
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,160
your What if some of these loans
just don't turn out to

68
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,960
be so good?

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,120
So leverage, when things are
good, when they go on the

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,650
upside, it kind of multiplies
how much money

71
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,200
you're going to make.

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,860
But as you're going to see in
about a second, on the down

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,770
side, leverage also multiplies
the loss you would take.

74
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:59,500
So in this situation, what
happens if I had a 30% loss--

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,090
let's say I have a 50% loss on
these loans that I made.

76
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,190
In a world without leverage--
so if I didn't have all this

77
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,100
leverage, if I just had the
same amount of assets and

78
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,720
equity-- so in an example like
this where my assets are equal

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,339
to my equity-- if my assets go
down by 50%-- notice here I

80
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,110
have no liability.

81
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,550
So this is all equity and
this is all assets.

82
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,080
In this example, if my assets--
for whatever reason,

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,160
I take a loss.

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,370
If they go down by 50%, my new
balance sheet looks like this.

85
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,480
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,880
My new balance you will look
like this-- 150 and 150.

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,300
So my equity also went
down by 50%.

88
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,690
I took a 50% loss because
maybe I made some bad

89
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,710
investments.

90
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,890
But now that I have leverage,
what happens if the value of

91
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,170
my assets get written down
by-- at some point, I

92
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,690
determine that Loan B-- they're
probably not going to

93
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,520
pay up and Loan A maybe
won't pay up.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,140
So the value of my assets
go down by 50%.

95
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,760
So I have 1,000 of assets-- so
essentially I'm writing down

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,730
my assets by 500.

97
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:13,320
So let's say that I think Loan B
is only worth 50 and I think

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,920
that this is only worth 50--
because for whatever reason,

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,280
maybe I give these loans out to
build real estate or these

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,190
were loans to sub-prime
individuals.

101
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,820
Who knows?

102
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,270
Whatever loans these were, they
just weren't good loans

103
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,800
and I realize I'm not going to
get 300 gold pieces back.

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,010
I'm only going to get
50 gold pieces back.

105
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,680
But in this situation,
what does my balance

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,200
sheet now look like?

107
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,060
Now that I had leverage, my
balance sheet looks like this.

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,080
I have 100 in terms of
the building itself.

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,445
Then I have 300 of
gold deposits.

110
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:52,900
   

111
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,860
And then that first loan shrinks
to 50 only and then

112
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,390
that second loan
shrinks to 50.

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,240
So now, what are my
total assets?

114
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,490
This is 50 and this is 50.

115
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,040
So I have 100 plus 300 plus
250-- so it's 100.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,360
So I have 500 of assets,
which is

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,130
consistent with what I said.

118
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,780
Our assets go down by
50% because I had

119
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,160
1,000 of assets before.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,950
And then what are
my liabilities?

121
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,310
Well, I owe this 300 checking
account, this 300 checking

122
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,100
account-- because he might have
written checks to other

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,440
people so it's not necessarily
the same person that I lent it

124
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,860
to initially.

125
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:37,620
But I have-- let's see--
700 of liabilities.

126
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,340
So notice, I now have negative
equity, right?

127
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,720
Because assets are equal to
liabilities plus equity.

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,860
Well, if my assets are 500 and
my liabilities are 700, then

129
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,850
what is my equity?

130
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,060
Well, my equity's going
to be minus 200.

131
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,700
So essentially I'm broke.

132
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,670
This bank is out of business.

133
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,040
And in this situation, there's
a very good reason for people

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,470
to want to get their
money back.

135
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,620
There's a very good reason to
have a run on this bank

136
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,120
because frankly, even if you
gave this bank all the time in

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,540
the world, this bank is not
going to be able to

138
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,450
pay back its money.

139
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,880
Even if it were able to offload
these loans, it still

140
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,550
does not have enough money to
satisfy all of the demand

141
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,570
deposits or all of
the liabilities.

142
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,023
And this situation is
called insolvency.

143
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,750
   

144
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,020
Let me do that in
another color.

145
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,590
   

146
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,700
And that just means you
don't have the money.

147
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,450
You're not good for it.

148
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,500
Remember, when we talked about
the reserve ratio, that dealt

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,080
with illiquidity.

150
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,050
You wanted to make sure you
had enough gold left aside

151
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,320
that when people came and said,
I want my gold back,

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,830
that you had gold to
give it to them.

153
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,420
But if by chance, people ask for
more gold than you had, it

154
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,550
doesn't mean you're
out of business.

155
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,600
You just essentially have to
tell them, oh well, can you

156
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,340
wait a little while while I deal
with my assets and wait

157
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,750
for those loans to
get paid back?

158
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,290
You're still solvent.

159
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,410
Insolvency is when you actually,
because of bad

160
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,090
investments, you actually end
up with less assets then do

161
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,330
have liabilities and then
there's nothing left over in

162
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,710
the equity column.

163
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,360
And that's what leverage is a
measure of, because if you

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,320
have really high leverage, then
you-- notice, when we had

165
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,590
no leverage, you could take a
50% loss really easy, but now

166
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,040
that we had even 10:3 leverage,
even a 50% loss

167
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,490
wiped us out.

168
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,330
And if you had 10:1 leverage,
then even a 10% loss would

169
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,040
wipe you out.

170
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,280
So leverage really is a measure
of how much cushion do

171
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,580
you have to take losses
in the future.

172
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,654
Anyway, before I run out of
time-- and in the next video,

173
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,480
I'll actually talk about how
leverage is regulated within

174
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,190
banks, but just to give you
another measure of leverage--

175
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,560
because this measure I gave
you-- if someone says 10:3

176
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,420
leverage, it's assets to
equity-- another one that

177
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,950
people often use, often
in the investing

178
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,080
world, is debt to equity.

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
But it's really a measure
of the same thing.

180
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,210
Because if someone tells you
debt to equity, you can figure

181
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,130
out the assets to equity, but
in this case, the debt to

182
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,460
equity ratio before I took
any losses-- it was what?

183
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,920
My liabilities are-- this, you
can view that as debt because

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,310
I owe these people that
money-- is 700 and

185
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,410
my equity is 300.

186
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,240
So it's 7:3 is my debt
to equity ratio.

187
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,140
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

188
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,750
