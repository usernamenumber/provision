1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,056
It also became clear that there was one other way

2
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:08,170
to increase the capacity of a communication system –

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,988
we can increase the number of different signaling events.

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:13,961
For example,

5
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,615
with Alice and Bob's string communication system,

6
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:21,474
they soon found that varying the type of plucks

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:24,578
allowed them to send their messages faster.

8
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:29,600
For example: hard, medium, versus soft plucks.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,632
Or high-pitch versus low-pitch plucks –

10
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,424
[produced] by tightening the cable different amounts.

11
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:38,385
And this was an idea implemented by Thomas Edison

12
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,429
which he applied to the Morse code system.

13
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:44,949
It was based on the idea that you could use weak and

14
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:50,157
strong batteries to produce signals of different strengths.

15
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:51,995
He also used two directions –

16
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,452
as Gauss and Weber did –

17
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:58,045
forward versus reverse current – and two intensities.

18
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:03,739
So he had +3 V, +1 V, -1V and -3V ...

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,081
... four different current values which could be exchanged.

20
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,564
It enabled Western Union to save money

21
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:12,792
by greatly increasing the number of messages

22
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:17,057
the company could send without building new lines.

23
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:19,618
This is known as the 'quadruplex telegraph.'

24
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:23,402
It continued to be used into the 20th century.

25
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:26,240
But again, as we expanded the number of

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,178
different signaling events, we ran into another problem.

27
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:33,401
For example, why not send a thousand or a million

28
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:37,374
different voltage levels per pulse?

29
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:40,765
Well, as you may expect, fine-grained differences

30
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:43,916
lead to difficulties on the receiving end.

31
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,585
And with electrical systems,

32
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,748
the resolution of these differences

33
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:51,015
is always limited by electrical noise.

34
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:54,722
If we attach a probe to any electrical line,

35
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,673
and zoom in closely enough,

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,508
we will always find minute, undesired currents.

37
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:09,718
And this is an unavoidable result of natural processes,

38
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:12,640
such as heat, or geomagnetic storms,

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,263
[or] even latent effects of the Big Bang.

40
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:18,064
So, the differences between signaling events

41
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:21,280
must be great enough that noise cannot randomly

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,509
bump a signaling event from one type to another.

43
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,036
Clearly now, we can step back

44
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:33,955
and begin to define the capacity of a communication system

45
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:37,290
using these two very simple ideas:

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,592
First, how many symbol transfers per second?

47
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,028
– which we called 'symbol rate.'

48
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:47,166
And today, it's known simply as 'baud,'

49
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,547
for Émile Baudot.

50
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:50,188
And we can define this as 'n' –

51
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,915
where it's n symbol transfers per second.

52
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:58,156
And number two, how many differences per symbol?

53
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:00,969
– which we can think of as the 'symbol space.'

54
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,140
How many symbols can we select from at each point?

55
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,844
And we can call this 's.'

56
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,001
As we've seen before,

57
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,302
these parameters can be thought of

58
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:14,642
as a 'decision tree' of possibilities.

59
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:17,349
Because each symbol can be thought of as a decision,

60
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,554
where the number of branches

61
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:21,439
depend[s] on the number of differences.

62
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,479
And [given] n symbols, we have a tree with s^n leaves.

63
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,611
And since each path through this tree

64
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,634
can represent a message,

65
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:36,443
we can think of the number of leaves

66
00:03:36,443 --> 00:03:39,276
as the size of the message space.

67
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,839
And this is easy to visualize.

68
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,733
The message space is simply the width

69
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:46,577
of the base of one of these trees.

70
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:49,578
And it defines the total number of possible messages

71
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:54,886
one could send, given a sequence of n symbols.

72
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:58,185
For example, let's say Alice sends Bob a message

73
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:00,271
which consists of two plucks –

74
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:03,254
and they are using a hard versus soft pluck

75
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,648
as their communication system.

76
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:08,430
This means she has the ability to define

77
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,673
one of four possible messages to Bob.

78
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,790
And if, instead, they were using a system of

79
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,454
hard versus medium versus soft plucks,

80
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:21,134
then with two plucks, she has the ability

81
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:26,506
to define one of 3^2 = 9 messages.

82
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,406
And with 3 plucks,

83
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:32,372
this jumps to 1 of 27 messages.

84
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,562
Now, if, instead,

85
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:37,130
Alice and Bob were exchanging written notes in class,

86
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,616
which contained only 2 letters on a piece of paper,

87
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:45,908
then a single note would contain 1 of 26^2 –

88
00:04:45,908 --> 00:04:49,451
or 676 – possible messages.

89
00:04:51,388 --> 00:04:53,340
It's important to realize now that

90
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,660
we no longer care about the meaning

91
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,758
applied to these chains of differences –

92
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:03,458
merely how many different messages are possible.

93
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,100
The resulting sequences could represent numbers,

94
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,477
names, feelings, music, or perhaps even

95
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:14,147
some alien alphabet we could never understand.

96
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,133
When we look at a communication system now,

97
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,801
we can begin to think about its capacity

98
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,078
as [being the number of] different things you could say –

99
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,830
and we could then use the message space

100
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,100
to define exactly how many differences

101
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,672
are possible in any situation.

102
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,707
And this simple, yet elegant, idea

103
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:36,418
forms the basis for how information will later be defined.

104
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,568
And this is the final step

105
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:42,350
that brings us to modern information theory.

106
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,030
And it emerges in the early 20th century.
