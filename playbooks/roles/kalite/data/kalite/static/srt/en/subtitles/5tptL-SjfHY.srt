1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,665
We are now on problem
number 12, which

3
00:00:03,665 --> 00:00:04,915
I will do in magenta.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,180
All right.

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:15,260
If 2x is less than y, which
is less than 0-- huh.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,460
So both of these are negative,
and 2x is more negative.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,420
All right.

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,800
Which of the following
is greater?

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,710
So they give us a bunch
of choices.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,140
So let's see.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,490
Choice A is minus 2x.

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:37,390
Choice B is minus 2x plus y.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,890
Choice C is 2x.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,950
Choice D is 0.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,480
And choice E is minus y.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,540
OK.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,600
So the interesting thing that
should immediately jump out at

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,170
you is that both 2x and
y are negative, right?

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,400
Because they're all
less than 0.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,650
And 2x is even more
negative than y.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:00,850
Right?

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,080
If I were to draw a number line,
if this is the number

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,885
line-- we might be instructed
to even show it.

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,830
This is 0.

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,850
This is y.

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,290
2x would be some place
over here.

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,100
We don't know exactly where.

28
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,500
This could be 0, this
could be-- I

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,370
could pick random numbers.

30
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,620
This could be negative 1.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,990
And then this could
be negative 2.

32
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,400
Right?

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,650
These are just random numbers.

34
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,420
And actually, that might
be the best way

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,270
of doing this problem.

36
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,370
We could reason through it,
and actually, I will.

37
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,990
But the easiest thing is, well,
let me just take these

38
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,860
numbers that satisfy this
inequality and see what

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,170
happens with them, right?

40
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,110
And that probably is
the fastest way.

41
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,720
So in our case, what's
minus 2x?

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,140
So if 2x is minus 2, that would
be minus times minus 2.

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,440
Because 2x is minus 2.

44
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,170
So that equals plus 2.

45
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,370
What's 2x plus y?

46
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,410
So 2x is minus 2, plus
y is minus 1.

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,000
So it becomes a minus 3.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,725
So this becomes minus minus 2
minus 1, so that's minus 3,

49
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:21,980
but then you have a minus
outside so it's plus 3.

50
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,070
So we can immediately
say that this is not

51
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,840
the greatest, right?

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,270
Because we already found
one that is greater.

53
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,920
2x would be just minus 2.

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,470
We said that. soon.

55
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,820
2x is minus 2.

56
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,610
0 is 0.

57
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,150
Minus y in our example
would be 1.

58
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,620
In all of these situations, this
is the largest. And you

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,940
could try it with any set of
numbers that satisfy this.

60
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,820
We could have called this--
instead of saying this is 2x,

61
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,940
we could have called
this z and done it.

62
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,870
But without doing the number
line, and without picking

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,180
numbers, you could have
also reasoned.

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,690
You could have said, 2x is
more negative than y.

65
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,830
So if you put a negative in
front of 2x, it's going to be

66
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,916
more positive.

67
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:05,590
Right?

68
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,180
Because a negative times a
negative is a positive.

69
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,770
So it'll become a
more positive.

70
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,620
So first of all, this number
will be a negative number, so

71
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,580
that's not right.

72
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,370
This number will be positive,
so 0 can't be the answer.

73
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,600
And then you say, well,
what's bigger?

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,960
Minus y or minus 2x?

75
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,370
Well, minus 2x is more negative,
so minus-- or sorry.

76
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,460
2x is more negative, so minus
2x will be more positive.

77
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,530
So you know it's not
going to be this.

78
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,710
So then you're picking
between these two.

79
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,020
And then you have to say, well,
what's more negative?

80
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,410
2x or 2x plus y?

81
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,890
Well, 2x plus y is going to
be a more negative number,

82
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,740
because both of these are
negative numbers.

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,170
So when you add them, you're
going to get something even

84
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,920
more negative than
either of them.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,290
Then we take the negative of
that, you get a larger

86
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,610
positive number.

87
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,400
That last explanation might
have been confusing.

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,670
And really, the easiest way is
just pick some numbers that

89
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,250
satisfy this inequality.

90
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,440
And then substitute, and then
you have your answer.

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,830
All right.

92
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:10,090
Number 13, which I'll do
in this pale yellow.

93
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,060
Carlos delivered n packages
on Monday.

94
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,550
So Monday, n.

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,170
4 times as many packages on
Tuesday as on Monday.

96
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,160
So on Tuesday, he did 4 times
as many, so that's 4n.

97
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,180
And 3 more-- not 3 times, 3
more-- packages on Wednesday

98
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,720
than Monday.

99
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,700
So Wednesday, 3 more packages
on Wednesday than Monday.

100
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,810
So this is n plus 3, 3
more than on Monday.

101
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,590
What is the average number of
packages he delivered per day

102
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,940
over the three days?

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,190
So what's the average of
these three numbers?

104
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,830
So let's see.

105
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,080
We sum them up.

106
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,640
n plus 4n plus n plus 3, and
we divide by 3, because

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,620
there's three days.

108
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,120
n plus 4n is 5n, plus
3 is 6n. you

109
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,990
So it's 6n plus 3 over 3.

110
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,180
Divide all the terms by 3,
that equals 2n plus 1.

111
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,500
And we are done.

112
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,895
That was number 13,
which was C.

113
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:27,490
Number 14.

114
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,260
This looks exciting.

115
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:45,020
a plus b to the 1/2 is equal to
a minus b to the minus 1/2.

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,780
Which of the following
must be true?

117
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,160
And they say, b is equal to 0.

118
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,830
That's choice A.

119
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,160
They say a plus b
is equal to 1.

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,290
a minus b is equal to 1.

121
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,880
a squared plus b squared
is equal to 1.

122
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,910
a squared minus b squared
is equal to 1.

123
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, what I want to do is, I
just want to write this in a

124
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,300
form that makes more
sense to me.

125
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,870
So this is essentially saying
the square root of a plus b is

126
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:22,780
equal to 1 over the square
root of a minus b.

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,630
Right?

128
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,640
Negative 1/2.

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,840
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation times the

130
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,970
square root of a minus b.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,770
This side will just
cancel out, right?

132
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,440
And you're just left with 1.

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,320
This is the same thing as the
square root of a minus b

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,562
times a plus b.

135
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,830
Right?

136
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,360
And then on the right-hand
side, we're

137
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,990
just left with a 1.

138
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,300
And what's a minus
b times a plus b?

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,350
So this is the square root of
a squared minus b squared is

140
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,600
equal to 1.

141
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,080
We could square both
sides, right?

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,560
So if we square both sides, so
we take both to the second

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,710
power, what are we left with?

144
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,890
This radical sign goes away, so
we're left with a squared

145
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,650
minus b squared is equal to 1.

146
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,190
And that is choice E.

147
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,700
Let's see.

148
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,995
Do I have time to do
the next problem?

149
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,570
It looks complicated.

150
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,110
So let me wait to do the next
problem in the next video.

151
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,360
See you soon.
