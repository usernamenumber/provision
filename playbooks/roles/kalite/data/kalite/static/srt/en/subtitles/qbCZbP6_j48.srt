1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,980
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to talk a little bit about spectrophotometry.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,570
Spectrophotometry

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,220
sounds fairly sophisticated,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,990
but it's really based on a fairly simple principle.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,380
So let's say we have two solutions

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,780
that contain some type of solute.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,300
So that is solution one, and then this is solution two.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,590
And let's just assume that

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,640
our beakers have the same width.

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,710
Now let's say solution 1--

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,500
let me put it right here, number 1, and number 2.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,450
Now let's say that solution 1 has less of the solute in it.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,930
So that's the water line right there.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,430
So this guy has less of it.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,370
And let's say it's yellow or to our eyes it looks yellow.

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,840
So this has less of it.

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,790
Actually, let me do it this way.

19
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,500
Let me shade it in like this.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,830
So it has less of it.

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,650
And let's say solution number 2 has more of the solute.

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,590
So it's more.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,590
So I'll just kind of represent that

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,370
as more closely packed lines.

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,360
So the concentration of the solute is higher here.

26
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,440
So let me write higher concentration.

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,190
And let's say this is a lower concentration.

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,250
Now let's think about what will happen

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,690
if we shine some light through each of these beakers.

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,090
And let's just assume that

31
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,910
we are shining at a wavelength of light

32
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:35,000
that is specifically sensitive to

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,990
the solute that we have dissolved in here.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,380
I'll just leave that pretty general right now.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,110
So let's say I have some light here of some intensity.

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,610
So let's just call that the incident intensity.

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,110
I'll say that's I0.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,450
So it's some intensity.

39
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,750
What's going to happen as the light exits

40
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,090
the other side of this beaker right here?

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,240
Well, some of it is going to be at absorbed.

42
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,670
Some of this light, at certain frequencies,

43
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,080
is going to be absorbed

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,130
by our little molecules inside the beaker.

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,210
And so you're actually going to have less light

46
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,570
coming out from the other side.

47
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,230
Especially less of those specific frequencies

48
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,310
that these molecules in here like to absorb.

49
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,580
So your're going to have less light

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,720
come out the other side.

51
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll call this I1.

52
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,010
Now in this situation,

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,530
if we shine the same amount of light--

54
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,660
so I0--

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,520
that's supposed to be an arrow there,

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,210
but my arrow is kind of degrading.

57
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,170
If we shined the same amount of light into this beaker--

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,260
so it's the same number, that and that is the same--

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,370
the same intensity of light,

60
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,200
what's going to happen?

61
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,560
Well more of those specific frequencies of light

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,970
are going to be absorbed

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,010
as the light travels through this beaker.

64
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,360
It's just going to bump into more molecules

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,190
because it's a higher concentration here.

66
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,930
So the light that comes out

67
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,020
when you have a higher concentration--

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,450
I'll call the intensity I2--

69
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,440
this is going to have a lower intensity of light

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,110
that's being transmitted than this one over here.

71
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,280
In this case, I2 is going to have a lower intensity,

72
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,720
is going to be less than I1.

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,460
And hopefully, that makes intuitive sense.

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,460
These light, if you imagine,

75
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,090
photons are just going to bump into more molecules.

76
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,120
They're going to be absorbed by more molecules.

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,130
So there'll be fewer that make it through

78
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,610
than these right here,

79
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,220
because here it is less concentrated.

80
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:45,150
It's also the case if the beaker was thicker.

81
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,640
Let me draw another beaker.

82
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,550
If you have another beaker that is maybe twice as wide,

83
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,810
and let's say it has the same concentration as number 2.

84
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,370
We'll call this one number 3.

85
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,720
It has the same concentration as number 2,

86
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,090
so I'll try to make it look fairly similar to this.

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,490
And you were to shine some light in here.

88
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,390
Generally you want to focus on the frequencies

89
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,660
that this is the best at absorbing.

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,270
But let's say you shine the same light in here.

91
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,580
And you have some light

92
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,570
that makes it through, that exits.

93
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,350
And this is actually what your eyes would see.

94
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,610
So this is I3 right there,

95
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,090
what do you think is going to happen?

96
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,910
Well it's the same concentration,

97
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,590
but this light has to travel a further distance

98
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,500
to that concentration.

99
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,500
So once again, it's going to bump into more molecules

100
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,630
and more of it will be absorbed.

101
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,880
And so less light will be transmitted.

102
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,370
So I2 is less than I1,

103
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,730
and I3 is actually going to be the least.

104
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,170
And if you were looking at these,

105
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,430
this has the least light,

106
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,170
this has a little bit more light being transmitted,

107
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,320
this has the most light being transmitted.

108
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,630
So if you were to look at this,

109
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,080
if you placed your eyeball right here--

110
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,290
those are eyelashes--

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,740
this one right here would have the lightest color.

112
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,920
You're getting the most light into your eye.

113
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,510
This would be a slightly darker color,

114
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,380
and this would be the darkest color.

115
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,800
That makes complete sense.

116
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,950
If you dissolve something,

117
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,070
if you dissolve a little bit of something in water,

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,260
it will still be pretty transparent.

119
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,080
If you dissolve a lot of something in water,

120
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,880
it'll be more opaque.

121
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,590
And if the cup that you're dissolving in,

122
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,910
or the beaker that you're in gets even longer,

123
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,910
it'll get even more opaque.

124
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,750
So hopefully that gives you

125
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,380
the intuition behind spectrophotometry.

126
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,280
And so the next question is,

127
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,870
well what is it even good for?

128
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,730
Why would I even care?

129
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,210
Well you could actually use this information.

130
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,910
You could see how much light is transmitted

131
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,110
versus how much you put in

132
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,930
to actually figure out the concentration of a solution.

133
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,350
That's why we're even talking about it

134
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,750
in a chemistry context.

135
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,770
So before we do that--

136
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,470
and I'll show you an example of that in the next video--

137
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,030
let me just define some terms of！！

138
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,350
ways of measuring how concentrated this is.

139
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,780
Or ways of measuring how much light is transmitted

140
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,540
versus how much was put in.

141
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:11,150
So the first thing I will define is transmittance.

142
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,320
And so when the people who defined it said,

143
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,360
well you know, what we care about is

144
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,630
how much is transmitted versus how much went in.

145
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,700
So let's just define transmittance as that ratio,

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,710
the amount that gets through.

147
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,370
So in this example, the transmittance of number 1

148
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,630
would be the amount that got through

149
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,750
over the amount that you put in.

150
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,280
Over here, the transmittance would be

151
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,810
the amount that you got out over the amount that you put in.

152
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,730
And as we see,

153
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,890
this one right here will be a lower number.

154
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,560
I2 is lower than I1.

155
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,660
So this will have a lower transmittance than number 1.

156
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,260
So let's call this transmittance 2.

157
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,750
This is transmittance 1.

158
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,610
And transmittance 3 is the light that comes out,

159
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,950
that gets through, over the light that goes in.

160
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,290
And this is the smallest number, followed by that,

161
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,070
followed by that.

162
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,030
So this will have the least transmittance--

163
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,120
it's the most opaque--

164
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,710
followed by that, followed by that.

165
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,150
Now another definition--

166
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,270
which was really kind of a derivative of the--

167
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,850
not in the calculus sense,

168
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,730
this is just derived from transmittance

169
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,920
and we'll see it has pretty neat properties--

170
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,770
is the notion of absorbance.

171
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,260
And so here, we're trying to measure

172
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,570
how good is it at absorbing?

173
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,300
This is measuring how good are you at transmitting.

174
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,190
A higher number says your transmitting a lot.

175
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,730
But absorbance is how good you're absorbing.

176
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,900
So it's kind of the opposite.

177
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,780
If you're good at transmitting,

178
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,220
that means you're bad at absorbing,

179
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,270
you don't have a lot to absorb.

180
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,910
If you're good at absorbing,

181
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,590
that means you're not transmitting much.

182
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,000
So absorbance right here.

183
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,750
And that is defined

184
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:59,670
as the negative log of transmittance.

185
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,160
And this logarithm is base 10.

186
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,970
Or you could view that,

187
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,730
the transmittance we've already defined,

188
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,670
as the negative log of the light

189
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:21,460
that is transmitted over the light that is input.

190
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,210
But the easiest way is

191
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,600
the negative log of the transmittance.

192
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,480
So if transmittance is a large number,

193
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,870
absorbance is a small number, which makes sense.

194
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,580
If you're transmitting a lot of light,

195
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
the absorbance number's going to be very small,

196
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,830
which means you are not absorbing that much.

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,620
If transmittance is a low number,

198
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,080
that means you're absorbing a lot.

199
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,230
And so this will actually be a large number.

200
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,890
And that's what the negative log gives us.

201
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,810
Now what's also cool about this is,

202
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,280
there's something called the Beer-Lambert law,

203
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,800
which you could verify.

204
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,990
We'll actually use this in the next video,

205
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:56,600
the Beer-Lambert law.

206
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,570
I actually don't know

207
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,210
the history of where it came from.

208
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,090
And I'm sure it's based on somebody named Beer,

209
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,660
but I always imagined it's based on

210
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,360
someone transmitting light through beer.

211
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,270
The Beer-Lambert law tells us that

212
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,900
the absorbance is proportional--

213
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,160
I should write it like this--

214
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,980
the absorbance is proportional to the path length--

215
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,000
so this would be how far

216
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,900
does the light have to go through the solution.

217
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,730
So it's proportional to the path length

218
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,050
times the concentration.

219
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,570
And usually, we use molarity for the concentration.

220
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,790
Or another way to say it is that

221
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,980
the absorbance is equal to some constant--

222
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,240
it's usually a lowercase epsilon like that--

223
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,230
and this is dependent on the solution,

224
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,850
or the solute in question,

225
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,090
what we actually have in here,

226
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,130
and the temperature, and the pressure, and all of that.

227
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,080
Well it's equal to some constant,

228
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,920
times the length it has to travel,

229
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,140
times the concentration.

230
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,440
Let me make it clear right here.

231
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:11,040
This thing right here is concentration.

232
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,000
And the reason why this is super useful is,

233
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:16,830
you can imagine,

234
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,210
if you have something of a known concentration--

235
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,290
let me draw right here.

236
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,910
So let's say we have an axis right here, that's axis.

237
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,410
And over here I'm measuring concentration.

238
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,980
This is our concentration axis.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,610
And we're measuring it as molarity.

240
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,610
And let's say the molarity starts at 0.

241
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,150
It goes, I don't know,

242
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,730
0.1, 0.2, 0.3, so on and so forth.

243
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,390
And over here you're measuring absorbance,

244
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,000
in the vertical axis you measure absorbance.

245
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,370
You measure absorbance just like that.

246
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,630
Now let's say you have some solution

247
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,980
and you know the concentration,

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,670
you know it is a 0.1 molar concentration.

249
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,050
So let me write down M for molar.

250
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,160
And you measure its absorbance,

251
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,270
and you just get some number here.

252
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,400
So you measure its absorbance

253
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,350
and you get its absorbance.

254
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,730
So this is a low concentration,

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,090
it didn't absorb that much.

256
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,260
You get, I don't know, some number here,

257
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,160
so let's say it's 0.25.

258
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,960
And then, let's say that

259
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,660
you then take another known concentration,

260
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,040
let's say 0.2 molar.

261
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,310
And you say that, oh look, it has an absorbance of 0.5.

262
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,010
So let me do that in a different color.

263
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,700
It has an absorbance, right here, at 0.5.

264
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,550
And I should put a 0 in front of these, 0.5 and 0.25.

265
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,770
What this tells you, this is a linear relationship.

266
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,960
That for any concentration,

267
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,170
the absorbance is going to be on a line.

268
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,700
And if you want a little review of algebra,

269
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,390
this epsilon is actually going to be

270
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,680
the slope of that line.

271
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,440
Well actually, the epsilon times the length will be the slope.

272
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,320
I don't want to confuse you too much.

273
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,710
But the important thing to realize is that

274
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,330
you have a line here.

275
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,060
And the reason that's useful is--

276
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
you could use a little bit of algebra

277
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,300
to figure out the equation of the line.

278
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,050
Or you could just look at it graphically and say,

279
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,630
OK, I had two known concentrations

280
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,840
and I was able to figure out the absorbance！！

281
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,210
well I just measured those

282
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,760
because I know that it's a linear relationship,

283
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,770
the Beer-Lambert law.

284
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,980
And if you just kept taking measurements,

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,650
it would all show up along this line.

286
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,470
You can then go the other way around.

287
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,190
You could then measure for some unknown concentration.

288
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,650
You could figure out its absorbance.

289
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,350
So let's say there's some unknown concentration,

290
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,900
and you figure out its absorbance is right over here.

291
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,490
Let's say it's 0.4, it has an absorbance of 0.4.

292
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,710
Then you can just go on this line right here,

293
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,610
and you say OK, well then that must be

294
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,770
a concentration of whatever number this is.

295
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,430
Then you could measure it,

296
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,730
or you can actually figure it out algebraically.

297
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,710
And so this will be pretty close to 0.2 molar,

298
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,460
or a little bit less than 0.2 molar.

299
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,240
And we're going to actually do an example of that

300
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,110
in the next video.
