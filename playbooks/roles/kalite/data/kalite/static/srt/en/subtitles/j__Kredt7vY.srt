1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,150
When we first started talking
about central tendencies and

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,180
how we measure average, we
talked about the arithmetic

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,360
mean and there you just added
up the numbers and you

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,320
divided by the number
of numbers there were.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,040
So let's say our population
of numbers is-- we have a 3.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,110
Let's say we have three
3's, a 4, and a 5.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,480
That's our population.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,990
And if we wanted the population
mean here we were just

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,990
add all the numbers up.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:32,140
We'd say 3 plus 3 plus
3 plus 4 plus 5.

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,630
And then we would divide
that sum by the number

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,750
of numbers we have.

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,250
We would divide that by 5.

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,200
And we would come--let's see.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,170
What would this be?

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,160
This would be 9 plus
9; it'd be 18/5.

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,650
That would be 18/5,
which would be what?

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,180
3 and 3/5, which is 3.6.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,980
It's a population mean for
this population of numbers.

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,270
If we just rearranged the math
here a little bit we could view

22
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,200
it a slightly different way.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,460
How many 3's do we have?

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,410
We have three 3's, so we could
view this as 3 times 3.

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,760
How many 4's do we have?

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,470
We have one 4, so
it's plus 1 times 4.

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,950
Plus 1 time 5.

28
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,710
   

29
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,610
All of that divided by 5.

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,820
And then what we could do
is, this is the same thing.

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,840
And I'm just doing a little
bit of basic really,

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,790
number manipulation here.

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:36,130
This is the same thing as
1/5 times 3 times 3 plus

34
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,570
1 times 4 plus 1 times 5.

35
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,110
And if we distribute this
1/5 this is equal to what?

36
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,970
3/5 times 3 plus 1/5 times 1.

37
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,310
So it's plus 1/5 times
4 plus 1/5 times 5.

38
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,320
   

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,010
And this we can see in a
bunch of different ways.

40
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,860
Let me express
these as decimals.

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,170
So 3/5.

42
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:17,160
So it's 0.6 times 3 plus 0.2
times 4 plus 0.2 times 5.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,800
Or we could express these
decimals as percentage.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:29,050
We could say 60% times 3, plus
20%-- sorry, 20% times 4.

45
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,250
Plus 20% times 5.

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,570
This is identical to adding up
the numbers and then dividing

47
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,280
by the total number of
numbers there are.

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,860
But this is interesting because
here we had to know how many

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,720
total numbers there are.

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,350
We have to say, OK, we added up
5 numbers, we divided by 5.

51
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,750
All I did is I played
around with the

52
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,470
arithmetic a little bit.

53
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,340
And I got to this expression.

54
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,480
But this expression's more
interesting, or at least

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,860
it's-- well, it's different.

56
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,110
It's not necessarily
more interesting.

57
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,370
I don't want to make any
value judgment about it.

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,570
But here I don't know how
many numbers there are.

59
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm just telling you about the
frequency of the numbers.

60
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,810
I'm telling you that 60% of
the numbers are 3, 20% of

61
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,450
the numbers are 4, and then
20% of the numbers are 5.

62
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,570
And then if I were to calculate
this out I would get

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,750
60% times 3 is 1.8.

64
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,350
Plus 20% times 4 is 0.8.

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,450
Plus 20% times 5
is-- let's see.

66
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,290
20% plus 1, which would
be equal to 2.6, plus

67
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,680
1 is equal to 3.6.

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,360
So we would get the exact same
number, but what's interesting

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,780
here is that this tells you
just the frequencies-- really

70
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,030
the relative frequencies of the
3's, the 4's, and the 5's.

71
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,310
What percentage of this
population is 3's?

72
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,480
60%.

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,940
What percentage is 4's?

74
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,550
20%.

75
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,320
And what population is 5's?

76
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,870
And I'm doing that because we
just talked about random

77
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,880
variables and all of that.

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,410
In the beginning we started our
statistics discussion about

79
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,070
populations and samples.

80
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,950
But if you think about it,
every time you do one of your

81
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,580
experiments and you get a new
value for a random variable--

82
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,660
let's do our classic example.

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,630
We have our random variable, x,
is equal to-- I don't know--

84
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:27,040
it's equal to the number of
heads after 6 tosses

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
of a fair coin.

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,120
So that's our random variable.

87
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,910
Hopefully now, we can kind of
connect what we thought about

88
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,190
in terms of just arithmetic
mean and central tendency and

89
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,330
population versus sample, and
then connect that to the

90
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,770
notion of a random variable.

91
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,380
So when we first started
talking about statistics we

92
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,480
said, OK, you have this
notion of a population.

93
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,300
And that you would
sample the population.

94
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,890
And we gave a couple
of examples.

95
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,070
You know, the most common one
is you wanted up predict

96
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,100
the outcome of a
presidential election.

97
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,310
The population is everyone
who's going to vote

98
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,830
in the election.

99
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,125
You can't survey all 50 million
people or whatever's going

100
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:05,930
to vote for the election.

101
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,120
So what you do is you survey
a random sample of that

102
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,780
population and then you can
calculate statistics on that

103
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,210
sample that hopefully can
estimate the population

104
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,470
as a whole.

105
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,340
But what happens if the
population is not finite?

106
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,360
And just to go back, if the
population is finite you can

107
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,460
calculate things like
the population mean.

108
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,900
We learned the population
mean was that mu letter.

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,350
And that was you just literally
take up all of the items in the

110
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,620
population, add them together,
and you divide by the

111
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,660
number of items there are.

112
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,980
That's what we did up here.

113
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,610
If this was a whole population
of numbers, we've figured

114
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,480
out that this was mu.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,610
If this was a sample from a
population then this would

116
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,020
be the sample mean, but we
learned all about that.

117
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,830
But that's not what I
want to get at now.

118
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,980
But what happens if this
population is infinite?

119
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,510
If it's infinite and you're
like, oh, Sal, that

120
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,210
doesn't make any sense.

121
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,910
But if you think about it,
well, a random variable really

122
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,160
is-- you can kind of view it as
each instance of a

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,960
random variable.

124
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,900
Or every time you performed
the experiment you're taking

125
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,120
out an instance of an
infinite population.

126
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,350
You can perform this experiment
an infinite number of times.

127
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,530
You can just keep doing it.

128
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,780
It's not like, after doing it a
thousand times you're like, oh,

129
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,240
you can't toss a coin six times
anymore and count the

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,690
number of heads.

131
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,810
You can perform
this indefinitely.

132
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,850
So every specific result from a
random variable-- and those are

133
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,880
usually lowercase results,
lowercase x1 or x2 or x3.

134
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
These are just specific
instances of a random variable.

135
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,970
You can view these as samples
from an infinite population.

136
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,170
So I'll try to draw an
infinite population;

137
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,220
it's kind of harder.

138
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,390
Maybe I'll draw arrows that
go off in every direction.

139
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,610
This population never ends.

140
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,850
You can keep performing the
experiment and keep getting

141
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,920
samples, but you're sample
is usually finite.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,600
   

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,260
You know, let's say we
performed this experiment.

144
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,180
We toss a fair coin six times
and we do that experiment--

145
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,680
I don't know-- we do
it a hundred times.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,300
So then we would have a hundred
samples, x2 and it would

147
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,650
go all the way to x100.

148
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,330
And the reason why I'm doing
this connection is one, to make

149
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,520
you see the connection between
the random variable and the

150
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,840
probability, and the statistics
that we talked about earlier.

151
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,630
And in this video, I'm going to
introduce you to the concept of

152
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,530
the expected value of
a random variable.

153
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,110
And it's nothing else.

154
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,890
So the expected value of a
random variable, the expected

155
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,000
value of a random variable is
the exact same thing as

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,100
the population mean.

157
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,520
In fact, sometimes it's
called a population mean.

158
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,330
But what makes it interesting
is in this situation, you

159
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,730
have an infinite population.

160
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,310
So you can't just add up all
the numbers and divide by the

161
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,780
number of numbers you have
because you have an infinite

162
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,810
number of numbers.

163
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,430
But what you can do is if
you said wow, I know the

164
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,400
frequency of the numbers.

165
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,890
I know that 3 shows up 60%
of the time, 4 shows up

166
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,070
20% of the time, 5 shows
up 20% of the time.

167
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,290
Then, even if you have an
infinite number of numbers,

168
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,980
you can actually still
calculate a mean.

169
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,470
And that's how you do it
for an expected value

170
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,860
of a random variable.

171
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,810
So how do you figure out
the frequencies that

172
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,980
numbers show up?

173
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,850
Well, you can look at the
probability distribution,

174
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,570
the discreet probability
distribution.

175
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,350
So in that example that we did
last time, I forgot the exact

176
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,990
numbers, but actually let
me just take what we

177
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,050
did-- our Excel out.

178
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,940
Let me just quickly, I want to
make n 6 trials, probability

179
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,990
of heads, tails-- OK, 0.5.

180
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,790
And then I need to change
what this chart-- just

181
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,580
give me one second.

182
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,775
Change what the inputs
of this chart are.

183
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,520
I'm off the screen right now.

184
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:06,920
   

185
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,090
OK, there you go.

186
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,970
So this is the probability
distribution for what

187
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,880
I just described.

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880
I have a fair toss of a coin
and I want to know how many

189
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,620
heads I have after 6 tosses.

190
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,760
So you can perform this
experiment a bunch of times,

191
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,480
but this tells you the
frequency, the frequency

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,090
of that random variables.

193
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,480
So when you perform that
experiment-- let's see,

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,090
whatever this is--
0.09% of the time.

195
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,910
No, actually, 9% of the
time you're going to

196
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,500
get exactly 1 head.

197
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,060
23% of the time you're
going to get 2 heads.

198
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,050
31% of the time you're
going to get 3 heads.

199
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,120
23% of the time you're
going to get 4 heads.

200
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,626
And then, you know 9% of
the time you're going

201
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,910
to get 5 heads.

202
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,330
And then 2% of the time
you're going to get 6 heads.

203
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,840
So if you have that information
you can then actually figure

204
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,530
out the population mean for
this population that's

205
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,490
described by this probability
distribution, or the

206
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,780
expected value.

207
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,800
And let's do that right here.

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,330
I'll put this over to the side.

209
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,320
   

210
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,660
So I'm looking at that chart
I just did while I do this.

211
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,240
   

212
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,090
We just looked at the
probability distribution for

213
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,160
this random variable, the
number of heads after 6

214
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,670
tosses of a fair coin.

215
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,910
So the expected value of our
random variable is going

216
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,050
to be each outcome.

217
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,210
So the first outcome is that
we had 0 heads times the

218
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,720
frequency that 0 shows up.

219
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,640
So we figured out before that
the frequency-- now, it's a

220
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,390
little inexact because I don't
have-- actually, I have

221
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,250
the exact numbers.

222
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,950
   

223
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,920
0 will show up in our random
variable 0.01563% of the time.

224
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,020
So let me write that.

225
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,350
So we're going to say, well,
this happens and I can

226
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,270
write it as a percentage
1.563% of the time.

227
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:19,230
Plus 1 happens
9.375% of the time.

228
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:26,920
And then plus 2 happens
23.438% of the time.

229
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:35,170
Plus 3 happens-- let's see,
it says 31.25% of the time.

230
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,340
Almost there.

231
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,730
4, I get 4 heads out of 6
tosses 23% percent of the time.

232
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,520
So times 23.438%.

233
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:53,130
I get 5 heads after 6
tosses 9.375% of the time.

234
00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,730
And finally, I get all heads
let's see-- no, I get all

235
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,370
heads 1.563% of the time.

236
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,060
And that makes sense again
because all heads should be

237
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,810
just as likely as all tails.

238
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,730
All tails is the same
thing is no heads.

239
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,610
So what we did here is
exactly what we did up here.

240
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,070
We took the relative frequency
of each of the numbers in the

241
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,050
population and we multiply that
outcome times its relative

242
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,420
frequency, and we're
adding it up.

243
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,640
But this is the exact same
thing mathematically

244
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,810
as we did up here.

245
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,860
But what's useful now is we can
apply the same principles, but

246
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,880
we're finding the arithmetic
mean of an infinite population,

247
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,060
or the expected value of a
random variable, which is the

248
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,690
same thing as the arithmetic
mean of the population of

249
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,000
this random variable.

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,030
So this value would be equal
to-- actually, let me just

251
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,040
use Excel to calculate it.

252
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,440
So the expected value of
getting-- the number of heads

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,960
you get after 6 tosses.

254
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,673
So this is 0 times its
frequency, and then I'm going

255
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,590
to add them all up and then
just will just do that

256
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,400
same thing in all of it.

257
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,100
So this says this will be 1
times its frequency, 2 times

258
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,920
its frequency, and then if I
were to take the sum of all of

259
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:30,140
them-- equals sum of all of
these-- I get exactly 3.

260
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,570
And that's actually kind of
an expected outcome, right?

261
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,030
I shouldn't use the word
expected too much.

262
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:39,260
That the central tendency or
you could say, the population

263
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,480
mean, of this random variable,
or you could say the expected

264
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,400
value of this random
variable is exactly 3.

265
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,290
And in this example it turned
out that 3 is also in kind of

266
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,330
the colloquial sense, it's
the most expected value.

267
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,920
It's the most probable value.

268
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,130
But we'll see in the future
that the expected value

269
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,540
doesn't have to be the
most probable value.

270
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,900
You could have a very high
probability of having no heads

271
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,120
and a very high probability
of having 6 heads.

272
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,690
And then you'd still have an
expected value of 3, even if

273
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,170
6 or 0 were more probable.

274
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,820
And I'll show you more
examples of that.

275
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,810
But the purpose of this video
is to really show you that the

276
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,790
expected value calculation
is the same thing as the

277
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,670
population mean calculation,
but we do it this way because

278
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,360
you can't add up an infinite
number of data points and

279
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,650
divide by an infinite number.

280
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,880
Instead you want to know the
frequencies of each of the

281
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,500
outcomes and then you just add
up all the outcomes weighted

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,450
by their frequencies.

283
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,290
But that's no different than
what you did up there.

284
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,000
And I really want to hit that
point home because sometimes in

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,160
probability books they'll just
give you a formula-- oh, the

286
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,590
expected value of a probability
distribution is each of the

287
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,330
outcomes times their frequency.

288
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,960
But I want to show you that
that is the same thing

289
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,470
as the population mean.

290
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,900
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

291
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,400
