1
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:05,412
In the last video we had Pete starting an open-ended mutual fund

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:08,171
that was managed by Pete Inc.

3
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:11,146
Mutual Funds normally have nice grand names

4
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:12,729
maybe they called this the Saturn Fund

5
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,997
and if there is a Saturn Fund out there, I just picked that name at random

6
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:19,930
I'm not implying that this is you or anything like that

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,514
I just made up that name on the fly

8
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:31,279
But it's managed by Pete Inc. and we called it an open-ended fund

9
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,995
because at any time one of the people who owned a share

10
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,548
or unit in the fund can redeem it back from the fund

11
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:40,978
that Pete or the management company would say

12
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:45,496
If you want your $180 back we'll buy that

13
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:50,780
we'll give you $180, you give back the share, and then we cancel the share

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,811
and if anyone wants to add to the fund

15
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,546
if they want to invest

16
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:57,413
the corporation can create new shares

17
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,849
and then issue it to people - sell it to people

18
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,770
and their money would go into the common pool

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,353
and the management company would take fees off of it

20
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,214
But that probably had you asking

21
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,767
If this is an open-ended fund, what is a closed-ended fund

22
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,786
or do they even exist?

23
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:13,097
And they do

24
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:15,099
That's what I'm going to talk about here

25
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:18,680
Closed-end funds

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,330
and closed-end funds on some level are a little bit simpler

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,396
What happens in a closed-end fund is that

28
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,349
all of the investors are essentially

29
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,813
Or I guess you can say that the share structure

30
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:31,630
is locked from the beginning

31
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,129
So if Pete wanted to start a closed-end mutual fund

32
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:37,647
he would once again register a corporation with the SEC

33
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:38,979
he would market it it

34
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,548
he would tell everyone "Hey I'm Pete, I'm an awesome investor"

35
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:43,165
"Here's my track record"

36
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,446
and then he would just get a bunch of investors

37
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:48,131
so lets say he's able to find 20 investors

38
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,616
and that's all he's able to find

39
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:52,030
so this is 20 right here, and I'm not going to count

40
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,130
but, let's say that there's 20 slices right over here

41
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,703
He gets 20 people, so let's say they each give $100

42
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:04,594
so he is able to raise $2000. 20 times $100

43
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:07,611
So he is able to raise $2000

44
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:11,362
And once that happens, the fund is closed.

45
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:14,350
Pete's going to do his best to manage this

46
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,682
So Pete will manage this and he will still take a management fee

47
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,782
Maybe the same 1%

48
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,764
But what's fundamentally different here

49
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:26,515
and he can market - well he doesn't have to market the fund anymore

50
00:02:26,515 --> 00:02:28,846
because he can no longer get new investors

51
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,213
and this is actually the main difference

52
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,914
An open-ended mutual fund

53
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:33,548
at any point in time

54
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,580
or I should say at the end of trading

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,265
at the end of a day, they can lose investors, or they can gain investors

56
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,130
so it's an incentive for an open-ended fund

57
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,380
to constantly market itself

58
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,687
because the manager wants to manage more money

59
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:47,331
so that he gets more of a management fee

60
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,182
And a closed-end fund

61
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,214
They'll market it right when they are creating the fund

62
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,730
But once they create it

63
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,516
So lets say he just got his 20 investors

64
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,148
Then it is closed

65
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:59,714
He can't create any more shares

66
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,383
or cancel any more shares

67
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,813
But what can happen

68
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,881
so you might say

69
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,829
well in a closed-end fund

70
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,433
How do these people let's say you're holding

71
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,932
one of these shares

72
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:10,063
let's say that you're holding one share

73
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,332
right over here

74
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,182
what happens if you want to

75
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:16,099
If you need to buy a house, or if you owe money to somebody

76
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,481
so you want to get the value of your share back

77
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,731
and the answer with a closed-end fund

78
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:24,382
is that you would then go sell your share to someone else

79
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,921
so this right here you can trade it

80
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:28,648
You can trade it

81
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,731
and you would trade it just you would

82
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,965
trade the stock of any company

83
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,635
And in fact when you go and buy or sell

84
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:36,064
a stock of IBM, most of the time

85
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,131
you're just buying or selling it from someone else

86
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:39,854
You're not transacting with IBM

87
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:40,850
the company

88
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,165
You're trading in the secondary market

89
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:45,188
you're not dealing with the actual corporation

90
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,632
so that's where the investor

91
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,130
get's their liquidity

92
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,132
and when we say liquidity

93
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:51,914
it allows them to convert it into cash

94
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,947
because they can trade it

95
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,352
So the big difference

96
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:58,626
open-ended fund: when an investor wants their money back

97
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:03,301
they have to deal with the fund itself

98
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,215
the fund will buy back their share

99
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,149
If some wants to invest in a fund

100
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,601
the fund will sell them the share

101
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,481
so they're always dealing with the fund itself

102
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,048
in a closed-end fund

103
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:15,249
once the fund is created it's share pool is fixed

104
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,716
and if someone wants to buy or sell a share

105
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,302
it happens in the secondary market

106
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,066
so they're buying and selling from each other

107
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:23,601
they're not dealing with the actual fund manager

108
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,544
The disadvantage from the fund manager here

109
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:26,999
is it's much less flexible

110
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,065
in terms of growing or shrinking the fund

111
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:31,781
The advantage is this fund manager

112
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,799
doesn't have to keep cash around

113
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:36,933
in case the share holders want to redeem

114
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:39,616
In the open-ended fund we saw that the manager

115
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,171
has to keep some cash around in case one of these

116
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,466
investors wants their money back

117
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,881
here - the closed-end fund - he knows that no one

118
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,982
can get their money back right here

119
00:04:46,982 --> 99:59:59,999
so he or she can invest as they see fit
