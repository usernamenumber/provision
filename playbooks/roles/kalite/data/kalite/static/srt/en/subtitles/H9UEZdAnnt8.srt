1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:03,320
Every year this apple farmer produces one million pounds of Apples

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,246
1 million pounds of Apples

3
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:09,302
But he's got a problem

4
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:13,073
Every year the apple prices jumps around

5
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:15,581
a bunch... sometimes it sells the harvest for over

6
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:19,714
30 cents and this guy makes a tonne of money per pound

7
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:22,467
and then sometimes it drops down to ten cents per pound

8
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,054
and this guy cant even cover his cost.

9
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:29,513
And on the other side of equation, you have this pie chain right over here

10
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:33,878
they... they specialize in making apple pies,

11
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,897
and when the price of apple goes super high,

12
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:40,240
these guys cant cover their cost and while running on loss

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,862
an when the price goes low, they have real bonnazza,

14
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:47,996
but neither party here likes this scenario.. They dont like the unpredictability of

15
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:52,222
one year having a feast and one year having a famine

16
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:53,792
so what they can do is...

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,898
Let's say we have the harvest coming up

18
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:59,466
pie farmers kind of afraid... What if the price of pie

19
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,206
goes down to ten cents per pound? Then he is gonna go broke

20
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:07,454
pie chain is afraid... What if the price of pie goes up to 30 cents

21
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:10,380
a pound... then these guys are gonna broke..

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,162
what they can do

23
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:15,860
is agree ahead of time... regardless of what the actual market price of

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,367
pies ends up being after the harvest

25
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:20,318
They could agree to

26
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:22,933
transact at a specified price... So they could set up a little contract here,

27
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,587
So they could set up a contract, where the chain

28
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,933
The chain agrees

29
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:34,575
agrees to buy

30
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:39,915
One million pounds at a

31
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:43,677
a specified date.. Lets just say after the harvest

32
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,880
at the harvest

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,250
for 20 cents a pound

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,727
for 20 cents a pound

35
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:52,554
this works out well

36
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:56,680
for the chain, because they can ensure, regardless of what the market price ends up being

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,327
they can ensure they pay 20 cents a pound, which is a good

38
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,996
price where could make a decent profit and atleast they have a decent predictability

39
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:04,993
and they can plan on

40
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:05,493
things...

41
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,433
and it works out for the farmer because he knows that for 20 cents a pound

42
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:12,067
he can cover his costs, pay his rent and pay his employees

43
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,256
and feed his family and it also takes out the unpredictability

44
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:19,720
volatility for him... for him as well

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,009
So what we have set up here is actually called a forward contract

46
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,002
This is a forward contract

47
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,835
and what it is as you can see.. It is an agreement

48
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:36,247
an obligation for both parties to transact in future

49
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:40,334
at a specified price... So at the time of the harvest, they would specify

50
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:44,000
when they write this contract, they would specify this date

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,671
I dont know what it might be... November 15th and on November 15th

52
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:52,333
This farmer is obligated to deliver a million pounds of

53
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,984
Apples and then this pie chain is obligated

54
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:59,328
to produce some money to pay 20 cents a pound

55
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,996
or essentially produce 200,000 dollars

56
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:06,067
and that way they both are essentially able to avoid

57
00:03:06,067 --> 99:59:59,999
the volatality and make sure they can survive.
