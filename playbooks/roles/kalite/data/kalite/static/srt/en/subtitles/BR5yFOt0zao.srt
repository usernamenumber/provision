1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,730
We're told that the formula
for converting a Celsius

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,400
temperature into Fahrenheit is
the Celsius temperature, or C,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,800
is equal to 5/9 times
the Fahrenheit

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,340
temperature minus 32.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,320
Rewrite the formula so it
solves for Fahrenheit.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,940
So just like I mentioned, the
C is Celsius, is the Celsius

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,780
temperature.

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,045
And the F is the Fahrenheit
temperature.

10
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,830
   

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,360
So right now, it's expressed in
terms of, we've solved for

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,560
C in terms of F.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,830
Now we want to solve for
F in terms of C.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,480
So let's see how we're
going to do that.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,430
So I'll just rewrite it.

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:44,060
C is equal to 5/9 times
F minus 32.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,510
And we want to solve for F.

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,480
So the first useful thing to do
might be to get rid of this

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,010
5/9 from both sides, or at least
from the right side of

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,860
the equation, so we just
have an F minus 32.

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,260
And the easiest way to do
that is to multiply by

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,295
the inverse of 5/9.

23
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:04,810
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 9/5-- and

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,810
I could put it here, but it'll
squeeze a little tight, let me

25
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,870
try it-- 9/5 in there.

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,780
If I do it to the right-hand
side of the equation, I also

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,600
have to do it to the left-hand
side of the equation.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,300
And what do I get?

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:22,050
The left-hand side becomes 9/5
Celsius, or the Celsius

30
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,480
temperature, 9/5 times the
Celsius temperature, is equal

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,060
to-- the whole reason we wanted
to multiply the right

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,330
side by 9/5 is these 9's cancel
out, this 5 cancels

33
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,910
out, and this just
becomes a 1.

34
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,820
So 9/5 times the Celsius
temperature is going to be

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,720
equal to this expression:
the Fahrenheit

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,430
temperature minus 32.

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,560
We don't need the parentheses
anymore, because this is the

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,410
only expression on the
right-hand side.

39
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,620
Now, we want to solve for the
Fahrenheit temperature.

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,580
So let's see if we can get
rid of this 32 from

41
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,600
the right-hand side.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,350
The easiest way I know how
to do that is to add 32.

43
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,920
Add 32 to both sides
of this equation.

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Add 32 to both sides.

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,070
The left-hand side now becomes
9/5 times the Celsius

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:16,060
temperature, plus 32.

47
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,580
And that's going to be equal
to-- this negative 32 and

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,630
positive 32 cancel out, that
was the whole point behind

49
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,950
adding 32, so it's just going
to be equal to F.

50
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,150
And we're done.

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,430
We have rewritten this formula,
up here, so it solves

52
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,770
for Fahrenheit.

53
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,460
This is the Fahrenheit
right here.

54
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,030
We've solved for Fahrenheit
in terms of the Celsius

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,280
temperature.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,466
