00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:04,507
Understanding the ethnic and religious commonalities and differences

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,256
in the state or the region that used to be Yugoslavia can be quite confusing.

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:11,318
But, what I want to do in this video is try to give a primer on it.

4
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:14,528
It's really key to understanding some of the triggers of World War I

5
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:19,205
and to, obviously, understand the breakup of Yugoslavia, which was quite ugly

6
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:24,528
during the fall of communism in the late 80s and early 90s.

7
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:26,704
So, first of all, it's a good idea to understand

8
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:30,443
where the word Yugoslavia comes from.

9
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,867
It's literally referring to the southern Slavic states

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,971
So, "Yugo" is referring to southern

11
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,635
and "slavia" is talking about the Slavic states.

12
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:41,278
When people talk about Slavic languages, they're talking about

13
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:43,612
the languages that are spoken in this region, but also

14
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:48,781
much of eastern Europe and what is now Russia.

15
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:54,302
Now, what we have here in blue is we have shaded in where

16
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:58,984
Serbo-Croation is spoken.

17
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:05,305
Which is the dominant Slavic language in this region.

18
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:08,156
And, there are multiple dialects, some people will say

19
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:12,308
"that's croation, or montenegran, or serbian" or whatever it might be.

20
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:15,311
But, most linguists say they're pretty close to each other.

21
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,823
And you can kind of categorize them as one language,

22
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:20,823
as Serbo-Croation.

23
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,977
And you see that it's now spoken in modern day

24
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:28,156
Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro.

25
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:33,648
That is the commonality here, the thing that ties together this region.

26
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:37,489
Now on top of that, the slovenian language is also Slavic

27
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,757
it's closely related to Serbo-Croation.

28
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:43,225
In Macedonia they also speak a Slavic language.

29
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,313
It's closer to Bulgarian, but it has some close ties,

30
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,896
it's not completely different than Serbo-Croation.

31
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,429
So you have this linguistic connection throughout this area.

32
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:57,822
Now, what divides this area is really religion and history.

33
00:01:57,822 --> 00:02:00,419
So, this area, if you go back hundreds of years,

34
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,561
it was under the control of various empires.

35
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,089
The Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire.

36
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:09,397
With the Austro-Hungarian Empire, you're talking about

37
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:10,564
a Roman Catholic Empire.

38
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,219
When you're talking about the Ottomans,

39
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:13,477
you're dealing with a Muslim Empire.

40
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:17,895
And they held different parts of this territory for hundreds of years.

41
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:22,293
And so what ends up is really a mix of religions,

42
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:27,762
and that often gets tied to what people percieve as their ethnicity.

43
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:32,308
And so what I have here is kind of a religious breakdown

44
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:36,219
of the former state of Yugoslavia.

45
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,490
So, in this pinkish color right over here, I have the areas that are

46
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,478
predominantly Roman Catholic.

47
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,154
And I say predominantly because it really is

48
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,971
all mixed together.

49
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,821
So, Slovenia, Croatia, primarily Roman Catholic.

50
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:53,645
If you look at Serbia, and Montenegro, primarily Eastern Orthodox.

51
00:02:53,645 --> 00:03:00,489
In Kosovo, you have a strong Muslim majority, right over there.

52
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,021
And Kosovo, before its breakup was kind of part of

53
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:10,355
Serbia and Montenegro, despite it having this very different religious makeup.

54
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:14,287
And then Bosnia and Herzegovina is where it gets really really mixed up.

55
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:19,156
Roughly half of the population, and it's been moving over the centuries,

56
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:23,229
but the dominant religion there is Islam.

57
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:25,419
And, in general this is where it can be confusing.

58
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,888
When people talk about a Bosniak, they're talking about

59
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:35,800
a Bosnian Muslim.

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,574
But, Bosnia and Herzgovina also has significant fractions of

61
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:44,368
Serbs, who are Eastern Orthodox, and that's why

62
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,966
I put the brown here as well, it's about a third of the population

63
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:50,117
and it also has a pretty sizeable Roman Catholic population

64
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,300
or we can say Bosnian-Croats.

65
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,899
So, just to be clear here - it can be very confusing, even when you hear

66
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,236
a history of it, or you hear it on the news - I remember

67
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:01,232
in the 90s, hearing the news and getting very confused.

68
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:04,368
If someone is talking about a Bosnian Muslim, or a Bosniak,

69
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:07,839
that's a Muslim living in Bosnia, that's what they tend

70
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,172
to be referring to. If they say a

71
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:19,171
Bosnian-Croat, this would be an ethnically Croat, who is

72
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:24,235
living in Bosnia. And they would tend to be Roman Catholic.

73
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:30,103
And then if you have a Bosnian Serb, this is someone who

74
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,833
ethnically identifies themselves as a Serbian, or as a Serb,

75
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:39,235
who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but is probably

76
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,173
going to be Eastern Orthodox.

77
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,242
So, you can imagine, you have these strong linguistic

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:50,830
and even ethnic ties, but at some point, because of the religion,

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,983
and dialect changes, there's also a significant

80
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:56,634
amount of differences here, especially when things got ugly,

81
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:59,120
as you had the fall of Communism.

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,366
So, hopefully this lays a groundwork of the commonalities

83
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,166
and the differences here.

84
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,298
And it will help us understand what got us into World War I,

85
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:08,431
or what triggered World War I, and also some of the

86
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,785
ugliness that was seen in the early 90s.

87
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,901
And just to finish up, with just a little bit of context,

88
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:19,633
this was not a unified state until World War I was,

89
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,705
to some degree was precipitated by a desire to make this a unified state.

90
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:28,914
This ethnic grouping, this linguistic grouping, tended to be

91
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,923
broken up with the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire,

92
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,699
entering into World War I you have this decline of the

93
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,919
Ottoman Empire which started to allow these people to start

94
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,700
to have more energy behind their desire to form a unified state.

95
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,042
World War I was essentially the catalyst that allowed

96
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:49,496
the state of Yugoslavia to unify.

97
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:53,767
And, in different forms, it stayed unified until the fall of Communism.

98
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:57,507
And, even though it was a socialist state, a communist state,

99
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:01,588
during the Cold War, it actually always had a strange,

100
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:04,435
and distant relationship with the Soviet Union.

101
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:07,699
But, after the fall of Communism, that was kind of holding it together,

102
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,366
especially these religious differences,

103
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:14,976
and these ethnic and religious differences broke it apart.
