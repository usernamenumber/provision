1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:04,052
We know that three points define a triangle.

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,200
So if I were to take three random points here

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,933
So let's call that point A, point B,

4
00:00:08,933 --> 00:00:12,400
and then point C right over here.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
If we say that these three points are the vertices of a triangle

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,333
they define a unique triangle

7
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:26,200
So this would be triangle ABC.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,867
Now we've also learned in the last few videos

9
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:33,533
That triangle ABC has a unique circumcenter

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,867
and that is a point that is equidistant to these three vertices

11
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,267
it's equidistant to these three points

12
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,733
So the way we can find it is to draw

13
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,600
the perpendicular bisector of each of these sides

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,733
and where the three perpendicular bisectors intersect

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,933
and we've shown that they always intersect at a unique point

16
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,667
that is that circumcenter.

17
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,333
And I'll do that really quick over here.

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,133
So let's say that this is the perpendicular bisector of that side,

19
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,133
this is the perpendicular bisector of that side,

20
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:09,400
and this is the perpendicular bisector of that side

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,225
So these are all perpendicular

22
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:16,010
and they each bisect the side,

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,667
so B to this point is going to be equal to

24
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,733
this point to A.

25
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,067
A to this point is going to be equal to

26
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,867
that point to C.

27
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,733
C to this point is going to be equal to

28
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,933
that point to B.

29
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,067
And this point right over here,

30
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,333
we've already talked about that,

31
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,800
we'll call that point O

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,867
We call that the circumcenter.

33
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:40,200
O is the circumcenter.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
This is all a little bit of review.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,467
So if we have three points,

36
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,733
we have a unique triangle,

37
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,333
that triangle has a unique circumcenter

38
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,533
which is equidistant to the three points of the triangle.

39
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,600
I should say three vertices of the triangle.

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,400
and that distance between the three vertices,

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,933
Let me draw that in a different color.

42
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,800
So this distance, the length of OA,

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,200
The length of OC, and the length of OB,

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:21,800
So OA = OC = OB, which is the circumradius

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
And, we've learned when we first talked about circles,

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,611
if you give me a point, and if we find

47
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,267
the locus of all points that are equidistant from that point

48
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,267
then that is a circle.

49
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,333
And when I say locus, all I mean is the set of all points

50
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,000
If you give me any point right over here,

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,428
so that's an arbitrary point

52
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:41,146
and you also specify a radius,

53
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:43,468
and you say what is the set of all the points

54
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:47,333
on this two dimensional plane, that are equidistant

55
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,667
that are a radius away from the center

56
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,200
that uniquely defines a circle

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,546
That's how we define a circle.

58
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,133
And similarly, if you say,

59
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,067
look, if you start with a center at O

60
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,200
and you say all the points that are a circumradius

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,345
away from O, it will uniquely identify

62
00:03:03,345 --> 00:03:07,431
a circle, and that circle will contain that points A, B, and C

63
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:11,667
because those are the circumradius away from O

64
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:14,400
so they are included in that set.

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,533
So the circle would look something like this

66
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:25,990
Trying my best to draw it

67
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,067
Now everything we've talked about now

68
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,400
like in the last few minutes,

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,667
is all review.

70
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,600
We know all of it, but I went over it

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,400
just to kind of reinstate a pretty interesting idea

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,000
that if you give me three points,

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,733
that defines a unique triangle,

74
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,067
and if you have a unique triangle,

75
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,467
and, let me make this clear,

76
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:52,933
this is three non-colinear points

77
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:59,067
So three points not on the same line

78
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,200
If you have three points that are not on the same line,

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,133
that defines a unique triangle.

80
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,467
For any unique triangle you have

81
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:13,133
a unique circumcenter,

82
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:22,000
and circumradius

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
And if you give me any point in space,

84
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,000
any unique point, and a radius

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
the set of all points that are exactly that radius away from it

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,467
that defines a unique circle.

87
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:37,744
So we went through all of this business

88
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,698
of talking about a unique triangle

89
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:41,118
with a unique circumcenter and

90
00:04:41,118 --> 00:04:42,344
unique circumradius

91
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,421
to really just show you

92
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:47,440
that if you give me any three points

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,994
that eventually really just defines a unique circle

94
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,527
So just as you need three points to define a triangle,

95
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,727
you also need three points to define a circle

96
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,194
Two points won't do it

97
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:00,579
And one way to think about it is that

98
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:02,994
if you give me just two points,

99
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,727
there's an infinite number of triangles

100
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,127
that I can construct with those two points

101
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,727
because I can put the third point anywhere

102
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:12,061
I could construct this triangle

103
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,794
I could construct this triangle.

104
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:16,794
I could construct this triangle.

105
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,127
And all of these triangles are going to have

106
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:20,061
different circumcenters and different radiuses,

107
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:21,727
and so they are going to construct different circles

108
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:27,394
that circumscribe about those triangles

109
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,794
So for example, this would be one circle

110
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,594
that could circumscribe that triangle

111
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,594
You could have this circle right over here,

112
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:38,527
so you see clearly that two points are not enough

113
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,127
You need three points.

114
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:43,794
Three points lead to a triangle, which leads to a unique circle

115
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:45,727
So that by itself is kind of cool

116
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:49,194
Now another question is if I have a circle

117
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:55,329
And if it circumscribed about an arbitrary triangle

118
00:05:55,329 --> 00:06:00,142
is the center of that circle necessarily the circumcenter?

119
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,861
So let's think about that a little bit

120
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:09,209
because there are some non-intuitive cases here.

121
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,794
So if I draw a circle right over here,

122
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,727
its center is right over there,

123
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:18,261
and if I draw an arbitrary triangle

124
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,927
where all of the vertices of that triangle are

125
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,461
on this circle,

126
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,794
is this center necessarily the circumcenter of that triangle?

127
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:29,327
So let me draw a crazy situation

128
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:31,194
Let me draw one where this thing

129
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,794
is clearly outside of the triangle.

130
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,261
So we could have one that looks like this

131
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,194
and clearly all three vertices sit on the circle.

132
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:40,056
So you might first say,

133
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,065
wait, there's no way this could be the circumcenter,

134
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,994
it's not even inside the triangle.

135
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,994
But remember, this point right here

136
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,394
is equidistant to every point on the circle.

137
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,594
I should say, every point on the circle is equidistant

138
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:52,994
from this point.

139
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,661
They're all a radius away.

140
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:58,727
And all three points of this triangle are on the circle

141
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:00,727
So they are all exactly a radius away from

142
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,127
this point right over here.

143
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:04,594
So this distance is going to be a radius,

144
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,061
this distance right over here is going to be a radius,

145
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:11,327
and this distance right over here is going to be a radius

146
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,261
Now, this point is clearly equidistant from

147
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,394
that point and that point.

148
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,127
We know that. It's exactly R away

149
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,461
from both of those vertices of the triangle

150
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:22,794
So if it's equidistant,

151
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,127
and we proved this in a previous video,

152
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,794
if it's equidistant from both of those points,

153
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:30,327
it must be on the perpendicular bisector of the segment

154
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,394
that joins those two points

155
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:36,296
So this must be on the perpendicular bisector.

156
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,794
So that's perpendicular, and it bisects

157
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,538
that segment right over there.

158
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:42,169
But we can make the same argument for

159
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,681
this segment right over here.

160
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,194
because this point is R from the center

161
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,727
We're going to call it point 0, I'm tired of just calling it "this point"

162
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,794
point O is equidistant from

163
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,127
Let me label these,

164
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,327
so let's call this A, B, C.

165
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:58,527
So we already said point O is equidistant from

166
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,861
C and B, so it must be on the

167
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,061
perpendicular bisector of BC,

168
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,194
and it's also equidistant from A and B

169
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,661
It's R away from both because

170
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,527
A and B both sit on the circle

171
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:11,461
they are both a radius away from the center

172
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,127
So it also must sit on the perpendicular

173
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:19,902
bisector of A and B.

174
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,127
Let me draw it a little bit neater.

175
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:26,861
So it must also be on this perpendicular bisector

176
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:33,394
And finally, it also is equidistant from A and C.

177
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,527
because those are both R away

178
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:36,794
they both sit on the circle

179
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:42,927
So it must be on the perpendicular bisector of AC as well

180
00:08:42,927 --> 00:08:44,727
So AC is right over here.

181
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,261
And this is what the interesting thing is

182
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:51,409
We're seeing that the three perpendicular bisectors

183
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,325
of the three sides of this triangle

184
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,594
they do definitely intersect, but

185
00:08:54,594 --> 00:08:57,927
they're intersecting at a point outside of that triangle

186
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,461
And that point is the center of this circle.

187
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:04,261
So once again, that last idea is

188
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,594
O is equidistant from A and C,

189
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:09,661
so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and C

190
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:16,261
Which would look something like this

191
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,927
So once again, we see that three perpendicular bisectors

192
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,927
are intersecting at a unique point

193
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,394
and O really is the circumcenter

194
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:27,389
so, if you take any circle

195
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,594
and you put any triangle whose vertices

196
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:31,194
all sit on that circle,

197
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:33,945
the center of that circle is its circumcenter

198
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:36,994
So we just drew a situation where this is

199
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,194
a circumcenter that sits outside of the

200
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,527
triangle proper.

201
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,194
So point O is also going to be the

202
00:09:42,194 --> 00:09:48,994
circumcenter of this triangle.

203
00:09:48,994 --> 00:09:51,594
And point O is also going to be the circumcenter

204
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:56,061
of this triangle right over here.

205
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:58,194
It's going to sit on all three perpendicular bisectors

206
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:00,994
and we know that because it's equidistant from

207
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:03,960
all three points of any of these triangles

208
00:10:03,960 --> 99:59:59,999
where the vertices sit on the circle itself.
