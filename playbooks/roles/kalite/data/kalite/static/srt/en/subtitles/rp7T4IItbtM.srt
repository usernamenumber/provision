1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,340
In the last video, we
talked a little bit

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,650
about the immune system.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,930
In that video, we focused on the
nonspecific or the innate

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,695
immune system.

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:11,945
So let me write that.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,310
And even in the nonspecific
immune system, we subdivided

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,870
that into kind of the
first line barriers.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,030
And those were things like the
skin, or the stomach acid, or

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,420
the acidity of the oils on
the outside of your skin.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,640
These are just natural barriers
to not allowing

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,210
things inside of your body, but
then once they get in-- so

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,520
you can almost imagine
these were the

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,830
first line of defense.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,730
And then you had your second
line of defense, but these are

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,970
still nonspecific-- and when we
say nonspecific, it means

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,680
that they don't necessarily know
what type of virus, what

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,460
type of protein, what
type of bacteria.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,430
They just know that this
thing looks shady.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,260
Let me eat it up.

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,950
Let me kill it.

21
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,450
Let me have an inflammatory
response.

22
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,710
So in there, we said, well,
there's an inflammatory

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,230
response, which I'm actually
going to talk about after we

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,470
do videos on the specific
immune system.

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,580
You have your inflammatory
response, which really just

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,990
gets things to where the action
is at and then you also

27
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,070
have your phagocytes, which
are these cells that are

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,810
engulfing things.

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,940
And just so you know, all the
phagocytes that we talked

30
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,070
about in the last video, these
are all instances of white

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,530
blood cells or leukocytes.

32
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,670
These phagocytes right here,
these are all-- I talk about

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,320
dendritic cells and macrophages
and neutrophils.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,900
These were all white
blood cells.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,740
These weren't all the kinds
of white blood cells.

36
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,310
We're about to talk about more--
and the other word for

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,920
white blood cell is
also leukocyte.

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,560
   

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,620
So that is nonspecific.

40
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,660
Well, one, it just doesn't let
you in, but then when you're

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,920
in, it says, hey, you're
just shady.

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm going to eat you up.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,980
I have receptors.

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,170
You have some double stranded
DNA floating around.

45
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,030
Only viruses have double
strand DNA.

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,949
I'm going to eat you up.

47
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,550
I don't know what type
of virus you are.

48
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't know if I've seen
you before or not.

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
That's why it's nonspecific.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,130
Now the really interesting
thing about our immune

51
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,240
system-- and this nonspecific,
this exists across many, many,

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,290
many species and types of
organisms. But the specific is

53
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,020
kind of a-- it's thought to
be a newer adaptation.

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,450
What I'm going to talk about is
the specific immune system

55
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,705
that's particular to humans.

56
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,470
That's our other
classification.

57
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,060
Let me do it like that.

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,070
So then you have your specific--
or you can imagine

59
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,690
it's an adaptive
immune system.

60
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,850
You've probably heard
of things like that.

61
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,690
I have resistance to that
bacteria or that virus.

62
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,800
So this is adaptive.

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
And it's really all based on
having exposure to things.

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,580
And within the specific immune
system, we talked a little--

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,600
when we talked about the antigen
presenting molecules

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,810
that phagocytes do-- that
plays a role in this.

67
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,430
We're going to go into more
detail, but I don't want to

68
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,230
confuse you.

69
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,300
But the main actors here are
called lymphocytes, not to be

70
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,570
confused with leukocytes--
because they still are

71
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,180
leukocytes.

72
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,430
So let me write this down.

73
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,060
These are specific.

74
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,180
Phagocytes, for the most part,
are nonspecific, but both of

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,860
these are white blood cells.

76
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,630
Lymphocytes are another
type of white

77
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,850
blood cell or leukocyte.

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,150
Don't want to confuse you with
this convoluted diagram, but I

79
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,510
just want to make the
terminology clear.

80
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,350
When someone talks about a
white blood cell, they're

81
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,380
really just talking about a set
of cells that when people

82
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,100
first tried to separate the
components of blood-- you'd

83
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,470
have your red blood cells that
would kind of settle in the

84
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,040
bottom, then you'd have this
layer of white frothy stuff in

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,840
the middle that was really made
of white blood cells, and

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,660
then on the top, you had the
fluid, the plasma from your

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,000
blood, kind of the
watery part.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,290
So that's where the name came
from, but they have different

89
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,350
roles, but they interact
with each other.

90
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:24,890
Now lymphocytes can be divided
into B lymphocytes, usually

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,380
referred to as B cells--
and T lymphocytes.

92
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,350
And the B and T just come from
where they're developed.

93
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,820
B lymphocytes were first
recognized in

94
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,820
the bursa of Fabricius.

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,810
That's why it's called B.

96
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,520
That's actually a part of birds
that participate in the

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,410
immune system.

98
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,520
And so the B came from bursa,
but B also applies to the

99
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,380
human immune system because it's
produced in bone marrow.

100
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,790
So that might be an easier
way to remember.

101
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,920
It's produced in bone marrow.

102
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,500
It's developed in bone marrow,
but historically, the B came

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,290
from the bursa of Fabricius,
just in case you want to know.

104
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,420
But it's easy to remember.

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,720
The B could also stand for bone
marrow because that's

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
where it's produced.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,490
T lymphocytes actually do start
off in the bone marrow,

108
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,760
but they mature and become what
they are in the thymus.

109
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,110
So that's where the
T comes from.

110
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,130
Now in this video, I'm going
to focus just on the B

111
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,260
lymphocytes-- because frankly,
if I focused on everything, it

112
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,530
would be an hour-long video.

113
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,570
But the B lymphocytes frankly on
some level-- well, I don't

114
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,230
want to pick and choose
favorites, but something in my

115
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,930
brain-- I just really like
the B lymphocytes.

116
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,570
So the B lymphocytes participate
in what's called

117
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,820
the humoral response.

118
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,050
And I'll tell you what humoral
means in a second.

119
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,810
You'll see that T lymphocytes
participate in what's called

120
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,910
the cell mediated response and
we're going to do that in a

121
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,160
future video.

122
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,770
They actually do certain classes
of T lymphocytes.

123
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,470
We'll see that there are helper
T cells and there are

124
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,950
cytotoxic T cells.

125
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,370
I know it's all very confusing
the first time you see it, but

126
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,180
that's why I just want
to focus on just

127
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,180
this part right here.

128
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,240
We're going to see in the future
that the helper T cells

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,710
play a role in amplifying
and really activating

130
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,400
this humoral response.

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,540
But a simple way to think about
the difference between

132
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,480
the humoral response and the
cell mediated response is,

133
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,470
when I get infected--
let's say I get

134
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,485
infected by a virus, right?

135
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,230
At first, when a virus comes
into my system, it's just

136
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,710
floating around in the
fluids in my system.

137
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,330
The fluids of our system--
that's really what humoral

138
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,800
responds to, into the humoral
fluids of your body.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,050
So you have your viruses.

140
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,270
These are little viruses
floating around.

141
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,740
So while they're floating around
and they're not sitting

142
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,710
inside of cells, that's where
the humoral response

143
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,600
can come into play.

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,070
Same thing if we have little
bacteria floating around and

145
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,860
they haven't infiltrated
cells yet.

146
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,320
They're just floating around in
the fluid, then the humoral

147
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,130
response can be useful
for that.

148
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:37,730
Now if all of a sudden, these
guys have infiltrated cells--

149
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,580
so if the cells are now infected
with the virus and

150
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,570
they're producing the viruses
using the mechanisms of the

151
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,940
cell to produce more, then all
of a sudden we have to be a

152
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,950
little bit more sophisticated
in how we deal with these

153
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,180
cells and how we deal with the
viruses because they're not

154
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,580
just going to be floating
around anymore.

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,230
We probably want to just kill
this cell even though it was

156
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,010
one of our own, but now it's
