1
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:08,834
[Steven Zucker] We're looking at one of the single canvases from a series of canvases

2
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:13,674
of the Campbell Soup cans by Andy Warhol, from 1962, at the Museum of Modern Art.

3
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:18,458
And one of the really important questions that comes up about, especially modern art,

4
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,112
is, "well, why is this art?"

5
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:24,684
[Sal] When you ask me that, a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain.

6
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:28,410
It does evoke something in me, so I'm inclined to say yes,

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,744
but then there's a bunch of other things that say, well, if I didn't see this in a museum,

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,060
and if I just saw this in the marketing department of Campbell's Soup

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,952
would you be viewing it differently?

10
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:38,715
[Zucker] Because it's advertising then. [Sal] Yes.

11
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:42,644
[Steven] But in the context of the museum, or in the context of Andy Warhol's studio,

12
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:44,969
it's not quite advertising, right?

13
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,519
[Sal] Even if it`s the exact same thing. [Steven] Yeah.

14
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,857
[Sal] And the idea here is by putting at the museum, it's saying

15
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,277
"look at this in a different way."

16
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:54,930
[Steven] Well, that's right. It really does relocate it,

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,838
it does change the meaning, it does transform it

18
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:00,241
and thats really one of the central ideas of modern art

19
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,232
Is that you can take something that`s not necessarily based

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,537
in technical skill,

21
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:06,786
cause I don't think you'd say

22
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,102
that this beautifully rendered. [Sal] Right.

23
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:11,752
[Steven] But relocate it and makes us think about it in a different way.

24
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:14,961
[Sal] And so, i guess he would get credit for taking something

25
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:17,777
that was very, almost mundane, something you see

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,642
on everyone, in everyone's cupboard, and making it a focal point

27
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,834
Like, "you should pay attention to this thing."

28
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,950
[Steven] I think that`s exactly right. And i think that he is doing it

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,057
about a subject, that was about as low a subject as one could go.

30
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,579
I mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away

31
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:37,476
from fine art, from the great Masters

32
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:41,173
and then to focus on something as lowly as a can of soup

33
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:43,845
and ... and cream of chicken no less.

34
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,426
[Sal] And, and, and I mean, you know

35
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:53,631
A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier people would have though this guy's a quack.

36
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,502
And if you did it now, they'd just think "he's derivative".

37
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,676
I mean right it's really just that time where people happened to think this was art.

38
00:01:57,676 --> 00:01:59,028
[Steven] I think that that's right.

39
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:07,031
In 1962, what Warhol is doing is saying what is it about our culture that is really authentic and important

40
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,577
and it was about mass production, it was about factory

41
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:15,003
in a sence he said let's not be looking at nature as if we're an aguarian culture

42
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,114
we're now an industrial culture.

43
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:20,151
what is the stuff of our world now

44
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,879
I thik I'm 80% there

45
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,062
I remember when I was in college there was a student run art exhibit

46
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:30,898
and as a prank a student actually put a little podium there and put his lunch tray

47
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:33,701
he put a little placard next to it you know Lunch Tray on Saturday

48
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:37,458
so he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was funny

49
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,778
and to some degree it sounds like what he did was art

50
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,240
well i think that's why it was funny, because it's so close

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,116
and to some degree when someone took a lunch tray and gave it the proper lighting

52
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:50,832
and gave it a podium to look at it and write a whole description about it

53
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:53,037
I did view the lunch tray in a different way

54
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:56,661
It's kinda the same idea. It's a mondane thing and you use it every day

55
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,448
Was that a prank, or was that art?

56
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,451
Well, I think it is a prank, but it's very close to art that some important art

57
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:08,387
He had liscense to do that thanks to Marcel Duchamp

58
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:14,527
Inn fact Warhol had the same sort of license to not focus on the making of something

59
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,650
to not focus on the brushwork, to not focus on the composition, not focus on the color

60
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,328
but to refocus on the making of ideas.

61
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:27,025
and the reason why we talk about warhol or duchamp or any of these guys

62
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:29,765
is that as you say, it's not like they did anything technically profound

63
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:35,196
campbell's soups' marketing department had already done something as equally profound

64
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:40,807
it's more that they were the people who looked at the world in a different way and highlighted that

65
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:47,469
Well, I think that that's right. Warhol is consiously working towards, asking the same questions

66
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,106
that the prankster at your school is asking

67
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:52,619
He's saying can this be art?

68
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,581
and in fact, he's really pushing it.

69
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,277
Look at the painting closely for a moment.

70
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,873
this is one of the last paintings he actually painted.

71
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,540
He's really defined the calligraphy of the campbell's soup

72
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,973
the reflection of the tin at the top.

73
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:09,798
But then he stopped. and he said, I don't want to paint the flore de leafs,

74
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:11,698
You see the flore de leafs at the bottom.

75
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:18,032
I don't want to paint those, so he had a rubber stamp made and placed them down mechanically.

76
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:22,042
What does that mean for an artist, to say, I don't want to even paint these?

77
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:25,114
I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier.

78
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:28,615
Warhol is doing something which is important which is reflecting the way

79
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,550
that we manufacture, that we construct the world

80
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,661
think about the things that we surround ourselves with.

81
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:38,116
Almost everything was made in a factory

82
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:40,324
Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore

83
00:04:40,324 --> 00:04:43,361
It's not a world that we would normally find beautiful.

84
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:47,298
I know sometimes I feel, correct me if I'm wrong, that a decision was made

85
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,005
that Warhol was interesting or great, and then

86
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:54,249
people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness

87
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:59,206
that oh, look he used a printer instead of drawing it which shows that he was

88
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:00,747
reflecting the...

89
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:06,212
But if he'd don'e it the other way, handdrawn it or drawn it with his elbow

90
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,611
or finger painted it or something

91
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,779
people would say "This is tremendous. We would normally see this printed by machine

92
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,892
but now he did it with his hands"

93
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,694
How much do you think this is the case? Or am I just being cynical.

94
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:20,867
No, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicisim

95
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:24,779
and i think in some ways what we're really talking about here is

96
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,707
What does it mean to be an avant guard artist what does it mean to sort of change

97
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:32,157
the laguage of art and try to find ways that relate to our historical moment

98
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:36,541
in some sort of direct and authentic way

99
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,254
and maybe it's easy for me to say this because i remember looking at this

100
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:44,449
when I was in fifth grade art class Andy Warhol and all that

101
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:48,616
And now it seems almost not that unique

102
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:53,902
But what I'm hearing is in 62, what I'm hearing is Warhol was really noteworthy because he pushed how people were thinking

103
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:58,281
I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter

104
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:02,704
that was completely outside of the scope that we could have considered fine art

105
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:06,545
And one of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstien, was asked to define what pop art was

106
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:11,662
and he said well we were looking for a subject matter that was so dispicable, so low

107
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,443
that nobody could possibly believe that it was art

108
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:18,445
And I think you're right and we think it's so much a part of our visual culture

109
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,729
that we accept it.

110
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:28,869
This is fascinating. I think there's a lot of potential there.

111
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:35,650
It's psuedo art created for other purposes, but if you shine a light on it

112
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,375
In the way a light have been shown on this

113
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,580
In your mind, does this cross the barrier into being art?

114
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,709
Well, I think that, you mentioned before, if someone did this now, it would feel derivative.

115
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:54,358
And I think that that's right, it underscores how hard it is to find in our culture now

116
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,359
ways of making us see the world in new ways

117
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,866
Yea, fascinating.
