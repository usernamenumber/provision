1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:05,695
Everyone in the kingdom is very impressed with your ability to help with the party planning,

2
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:09,364
everyone except for this gentleman right over here.

3
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:15,361
This is Arbegla, and he is the king's top adviser and also chief party planner,

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,935
And he seems somewhat threatened by your ability

5
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,616
to solve these otherwise unsolvable problems

6
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:22,407
or, at least, from his point of view

7
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,138
because he keeps over-ordering or under-ordering

8
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:25,536
things like cupcakes,

9
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,943
and so he asks... he says,

10
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:29,734
"King, that cupcake problem was easy."

11
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:32,472
"Ask them about the potato chip issue..."

12
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:35,473
"because we can never get the potato chips right."

13
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:39,282
And so the king says,"Arbegla, that's a good idea. We need to get the potato chips right."

14
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:40,691
So he comes to you and says

15
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,192
"How do we figure out, on average, how many potato chips we need to order?"

16
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:49,207
And to do that, we have to figure out, how much, on average does each man and each woman eat?

17
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:51,612
You say, "Well, what about the children?"

18
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:55,601
He says, the king says,"In our kingdom, we forbid the potato chips for children."

19
00:00:55,601 --> 00:01:01,193
You say, "Oh well, that's...that's always good. So tell me what happened at the previous parties."

20
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:21,472
And so, the king says ," You might remember, at the last party, in fact the last two parties we had 500 adults, at the last party, 200 of them were men and 300 of them were women, and in total they ate 1200 bags of potato chips."

21
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,276
You say, "Well, what about the party before that?"

22
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:38,339
He says," That we had a bigger sque towards women. We only had a 100 men, and 400 women. And THAT time, we actually had fewer bags consumed; 1100 bags of potato chips."

23
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:50,471
So you say, "King and Arbegla, this seems like a fairly straightfoward thing, let me define some variables to represent our unknowns.

24
00:01:50,471 --> 00:02:15,405
So you go ahead, and you say, "Lets let m=the number of bags eaten by each man. You could think of it on average, or maybe everyone, all the men in that kingdom are completely identical, or its its the average bags eaten by each man."

25
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:34,206
"And lets let w= the number of bags eaten by each woman. And so with that, these definitions of our variables, lets think about how we can represent this first piece of information. "

26
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:51,206
" In green. Well, let's think about the total number of bags that the men ate. You had 200 men, [Let me scroll over a little bit] and they each ate m bags per man. "

27
00:02:51,206 --> 00:03:06,135
"So the man at this first party collectively ate 200 times m bags. If m is 10 bags per man, then this would be 2000. If m was 5 bags per man, then this would be 5000. We don't know what m is, but 200 times m is the total eaten by the man."

28
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:10,135
"How do we figure out, on average, how many potato chips we need to order?"
