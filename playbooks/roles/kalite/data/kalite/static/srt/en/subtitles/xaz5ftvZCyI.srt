1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
   

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,900
Now that we've touched on all
of the major players in the

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,840
specific immune system, what I
thought I would do in this

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,060
video is do a summary
so it all fits

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,510
together a little bit.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,650
So the first person or character
we got exposed to

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,770
was the B cell, which
I always do in blue.

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,610
   

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,550
And what made that interesting
is that every B cell has its

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,980
own specific-- or they have
membrane bound antibodies, but

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,180
for each B cell, the membrane
bound antibodies on each

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,270
specific B cell had its
own variable portion.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,770
So this B cell-- it'll be
variable right like that.

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,030
And if I were to draw another
B cell right here, I would

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,440
draw the variable portion
a little bit different.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,780
This is why different actual
B cells will respond to

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,390
different antigens or different
pathogens that have

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,640
entered our system.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:05,590
And a B cell gets activated--
let's talk about what happens

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,445
when it gets activated or
what needs to happen.

21
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:10,800
   

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,370
It needs binding of the pathogen
onto one of these

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,863
membrane bound antibodies.

24
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:28,810
   

25
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,890
But that's not all.

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,480
I mean, sometimes that's all you
need, but usually you also

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,450
need to be stimulated
by a T cell.

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,750
   

29
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,580
And you might say, where's
the helper T cell

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,070
stimulate this guy?

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,390
Well, B cells were also antigen
presenting cells so

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,010
he'll suck this guy in, break
him out, and present him on an

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,455
MHC II complex.

34
00:01:54,455 --> 00:02:00,290
   

35
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,410
Let's say this is an
MHC II complex.

36
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,750
This guy gets cut up, part of
him gets presented right here,

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,500
and then an activated helper T
cell whose variable portion of

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,370
their T cell receptor is
specific to this could come

39
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:20,460
along and activate
this character.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,310
I'm not drawing that receptor
well, but that right there is

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,340
a helper T cell and that
is the B cell.

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,290
Now, once it's activated, it
starts differentiating-- and

43
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,910
it starts cloning itself and
it can either turn into

44
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,180
effector cells-- and this true
of B cells or T cells.

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,640
Once they get activated, they
keep cloning or they either

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,540
turn into effector cells
or memory cells.

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,150
Memory cells stick around a
lot longer so that in the

48
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,570
future you're going to have
many more of this

49
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,880
version of B cells.

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,790
So if you get the same antigen
or pathogen in the future, the

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,780
likelihood of it bumping into
this type of B cell is going

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,700
to be higher so the response
will occur faster.

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:10,550
The effector B cells produce--
they essentially turn into

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,710
antibody making machines.

55
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,630
So they'll say, gee, this
antibody bonds to this antigen

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,570
that we have in the
system now.

57
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,290
Let me just produce
a ton of them.

58
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,160
So it starts building up all of
the cellular machinery and

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,770
it starts producing antibodies
like crazy.

60
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,300
I want to point out one thing
that my wife pointed out to me

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,490
when I was-- she overheard me
making the last video and

62
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,890
she's a fellow in hematology
and a lot of hematology is

63
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,570
immunology.

64
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,640
So I definitely have
to defer to her.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,880
She is the expert on this.

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,070
In the last video, I kind of
very hand-wavingly said, B

67
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,230
cells, once they get activated,
if they're the

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,800
effector B cells, they
produce antibodies.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,570
I want to be very clear.

70
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,950
It is only the effector B
cells that produce the

71
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,560
antibodies and the common term
for them-- if someone were to

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,120
walk up to you and say, what
cells in the body are

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,820
producing antibodies?

74
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,640
You wouldn't be wrong if you
said effector B cells, but the

75
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,030
common term that people expect
to hear are plasma cells.

76
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,820
   

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,380
Plasma cells and effector B
cells are the same thing, but

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,980
normally when they say, what
happens to a B cell when it

79
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,050
starts producing antibodies?

80
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,620
They then call it
a plasma cell.

81
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,340
They don't call it a B cell
anymore and I want to make

82
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,860
that very clear because my
wife's like, well, I have

83
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,390
attendings that if they asked
me, what cell in the body

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,350
produces antibodies?

85
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,000
And if you said, B cell, they
would say, no, wrong.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,480
It's a plasma cell-- or if you
said effector B cell, they

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
wouldn't be happy.

88
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,920
They wanted to hear
plasma cell.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,290
This is the common term used in
immunology and apparently

90
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,560
rheumatology circles.

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,290
Did I just say my wife
is a hematologist?

92
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,570
No, no.

93
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,770
She's studying rheumatology.

94
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,210
I get confused with all the
tologies sometimes.

95
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,845
Anyway, that's what
the B cells do.

96
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:55,250
And these antibodies can then
go attach things and mess up

97
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,650
viruses and antigen-- well,
viruses or instances of

98
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,290
antigens and bacteria-- and
tag them for pick up by

99
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,650
macrophages or other types
of phagocytes.

100
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,390
Those were the B cells.

101
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,620
Then you have your T cells.

102
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,710
And here I'm going to talk about
T cells a little bit

103
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,310
differently than I had in
the last few videos.

104
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,210
Just to give a little bit more
of a nuance-- so there's two

105
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,420
types of T cells.

106
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,740
You'll say, hey, they are helper
T cells and cytotoxic T

107
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,710
cells-- and you're not wrong,
but what I'm going to do is do

108
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,010
a slightly different
differentiation just so that

109
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,600
you are familiar with these
terms. So there's

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
two types of T cells.

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,710
All T cells have T
cell receptors.

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:44,600
   

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,030
But they also have these other
proteins on them and some of

114
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:58,200
them have these proteins
called-- CD4 proteins and some

115
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,590
of them have what's
called CD8.

116
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,530
   

117
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,430
So this one right here
would be called a

118
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,540
CD8 positive T cell.

119
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,280
It has the CD8 proteins on it.

120
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,770
And this would be called
a CD4 positive T cell.

121
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,310
I've never used these
words before.

122
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,250
You're like, gee, where
are these coming from?

123
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,170
Now, the CD4 receptor is the
thing that wants to bind--

124
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:38,760
this is the thing that helps to
go to the MHC II complexes.

125
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,670
So most CD4 T cells are
helper T cells.

126
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,460
Most of the time-- and I want
to make it very clear--

127
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,940
immunology is a very-- I mean,
this field, people are

128
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,560
discovering things on
a regular basis.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,460
So people are still
understanding these things and

130
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,060
there's all sorts of special
cases, but usually when people

131
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,280
talk about CD4 positive T cells,
they're talking about

132
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,030
helper T cells.

133
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,760
So this is normally going to
be a helper T cell-- or you

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,430
could call it T helper,
just like that.

135
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,830
Likewise, the CD8 proteins,
these are attracted

136
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,820
to the MHC I complex.

137
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:21,340
   

138
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,480
This is what brings them to
the cells that have the

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,990
cancer, that have expressed
antigens

140
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,980
on their MHC I complex.

141
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,930
So most of the time CD8

142
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,060
positive T cells are cytotoxic.

143
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,500
   

144
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,170
And oftentimes, before a cell
gets activated, they just

145
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,890
describe it as a CD4 T cell
or a CD8 cell and after it

146
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:53,240
becomes activated and starts
wanting to kill things, then

147
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,400
maybe you call it cytotoxic.

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,390
But this is all wordplay.

149
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,680
I think you get the
general idea.

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,170
But just to remember what they
do, this guy-- we just said he

151
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,520
wants to bond to the MHC
complex, so you have MHC

152
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,580
complex plus presenting
some antigen.

153
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,840
This is MHC I right here.

154
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
We learned in the last video,
every nucleated cell in the

155
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,870
body expresses an
MHC I complex.

156
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,260
So this is the case where
something wacky is happening

157
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,500
inside this cell.

158
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,060
Maybe a virus has infected it.

159
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,210
Maybe it's cancerous.

160
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,909
It needs to die, otherwise it's
going to keep producing

161
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,230
viruses if it's infected by a
virus, or otherwise it's going

162
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,360
to keep dividing if it's
a cancer and infect

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
the rest of the body.

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,360
So the CD8 kills
infected cells.

165
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,710
I'll just say bad cells because
I don't if you can--

166
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,210
cancer really isn't
an infection.

167
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,445
Kills bad cells-- cells that
are-- if you don't kill them,

168
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,960
they're going to keep producing
viruses or keep

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,110
splitting and spreading the
cancer, while T cells--

170
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,080
they're attracted to
professional antigen

171
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,460
presenting cells.

172
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,950
And I always do a dendritic cell
right here because those

173
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,360
are the best antigen
presenting cells.

174
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,860
And they have MHC II complexes
and it's digested some antigen

175
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,020
and it presents it right there
and then that activates the

176
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,200
helper T cell.

177
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,810
And then when the helper T
cell-- all of these guys, once

178
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,620
they're activated, they all go
into effector-- they all start

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,690
differentiating into effector
and memory cells.

180
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:40,640
An effector helper T cell
does a couple of things.

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,840
So if we're talking about a
helper T cell, it can activate

182
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,970
B cells and it also releases
cytokines.

183
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,080
Let's say this guy
gets activated.

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,030
He'll also start releasing these
chemicals, which are

185
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,000
really those alarm bells that
tell other people to really

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,850
get in gear-- maybe B cells and
cytotoxic T cells start

187
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,430
proliferating more rigorously.

188
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,730
Actually, part of the cytotoxic
T cell activation

189
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,690
can be assisted or kind of
given a boost by these

190
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,910
cytokines-- of so by
these alarm bells.

191
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:24,500
So this guy's the alarm ringer,
while the CD8 cells or

192
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,570
the cytotoxic T cells--
in their effector

193
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,220
mode, they kill cells.

194
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,590
And of course in the memory
mode, there's just a bunch of

195
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,450
copies of these originals around
that are ready and more

196
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,120
than they were originally were,
so that in the future if

197
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,730
something like this or something
like this occurs,

198
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,500
they're going to be activated
faster because they're going

199
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,150
to be bumped into faster.

200
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,210
So hopefully that clears up a
little bit and I introduced a

201
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,925
little bit more tough
terminology, but I really want

202
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,750
to stress my wife's point
because she said, hey, you

203
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,560
don't want people out there
saying B cells produce

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,090
antibodies even though it is
effector B cells-- activated B

205
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,340
cells that have differentiated
into effector B cells.

206
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,680
Those are what are producing
antibodies-- because when they

207
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,570
go to medical school, people
are going to want to hear

208
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,560
plasma cell.

209
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,232
