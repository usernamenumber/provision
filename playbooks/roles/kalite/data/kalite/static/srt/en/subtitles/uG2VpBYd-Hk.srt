1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
I was interrupted in the last video

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,370
by a phone call.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,690
I was actually expecting a phone call

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,830
from someone whose call I wanted to take,

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,780
but that ended up being one of those robocallers.

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,240
So, anyway, I was on problem 163.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,380
Let me just start it over

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,000
so that I don't interrupt your train of thought.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,380
A fruit salad mixture consists of

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,020
apples, peaches, and grapes in the ratio of 6:5:2.

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,060
So the ratio of apples to peaches to grapes

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,550
is equal to 6:5:2 by weight.

13
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,030
If 39 pounds of the mixture is prepared,

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,740
the mixture include

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,020
how many more pounds of apples than grapes?

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,440
So they essentially want us to figure out

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
what the apples minus the grapes are equal to.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,380
So we have 39 pounds,

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,970
so the pounds of apples plus the peaches

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,050
plus the grapes,that equals 39 pounds.

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,280
And to do a ratio problem like this,

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,870
the easiest way is to say

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,870
let's just define the number of pounds of apples

24
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,440
being 6 times some number x.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,470
If the apples are 6 times some number x,

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,000
what are the peaches?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,660
We know that

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,150
the ratio of the apples to the peaches are 6:5,

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,400
so the peaches are going to

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,010
have to be 5 times some number x.

31
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,880
By the same logic, the grapes are going to

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,100
have to be 2 times some number x.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,250
And if you try out the ratio the apples

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,310
to the grapes is 6x over 2x, which is 6:2.

35
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,010
So it all works out.

36
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,620
So let's use this information to

37
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,020
substitute back there and see what x is equal to.

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:39,060
So we get 6x plus 5x plus 2x is equal to 39.

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,520
6 plus 5 is 11 plus 2 is 13.

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,080
13x is equal to 39.

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,080
x is equal to 3.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,470
And so how many apples are there?

43
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,080
6x, there are 18 apples.

44
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,440
We don't have to figure out the peaches,

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,490
but we can do it fast.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,000
There are 15 peaches, and then there are 6 grapes.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,030
And if you want to know

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,240
how many more apples there are than grapes,

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,980
18 minus 6 is equal to 12

50
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,860
--actually these are all in pounds.

51
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,020
There are 12 pounds more of apples than grapes.

52
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,000
And that's choice B.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,030
Problem 164.

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,040
Louise has x more dollars than Jim has.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,860
So L is equal to Jim plus x,

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,000
and together they have a total of y dollars.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,060
So L plus J is equal to y.

58
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,120
Which of the following represents

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,040
the number of dollars that Jim has?

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,020
So they want Jim equals,

61
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,360
and they want it in terms of x and y.

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,500
So let's take this L and substitute it here

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,160
so that we have an equation

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,030
that this has J's, x's, and y's in it.

65
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,760
So if L is equal to J plus x, we can substitute.

66
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,420
So we get J plus x, instead of an L,

67
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,230
plus J is equal to y.

68
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,580
That is that, just that.

69
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,930
And you get 2J plus x is equal to y.

70
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,010
Subtract x from both sides.

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,010
2J is equal to y minus x.

72
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,460
And we get J is equal to y minus x over 2.

73
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,010
And that is choice A.

74
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,640
Problem 165.

75
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's switch colors.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,070
During a certain season, a team won 80%

77
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:50,000
of its first 100 games, and 50% of the remaining.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,520
If the team won 70% of its games for the entire season,

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,850
so they won 70% of the total,

80
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,810
what was the total number of games

81
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,000
that the team played?

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,600
So how do we figure out

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
the total number of games that they played?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,560
It'll be 100 plus remainder.

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,500
So let's think of it this way.

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,580
If we wanted to figure out

87
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,700
the total percentage that they won,

88
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,750
we would want the number that they won.

89
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,030
So how many games did they win?

90
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:30,200
They won 80% of their first 100 games, so that's

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,870
80 games, plus 50% of the remainder games.

92
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,010
So plus 0.5 times the remainder.

93
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,740
That's how many games they've won.

94
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,020
Now, how many games did they play?

95
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,840
The total number of games is going to be 100

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,440
plus whatever this remainder number of games are.

97
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,060
That's their total number of games.

98
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,220
And the problem tells us that this ratio,

99
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,590
the total percentage

100
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,580
this is of all the games they won

101
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,740
divided by all the games they played--

102
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,070
that that is equal to 0.7 or 70%.

103
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,520
If we multiply both sides of this equation

104
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,610
by 100 plus r,

105
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,940
we get 80 plus 0.5r is equal to--

106
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,560
--0.7 times 100 is equal to 70 plus 0.7r.

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,030
Now let's subtract 70 from both sides.

108
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:26,050
You get 10 plus 0.5r is equal to 0.7r.

109
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,150
And then

110
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,460
if we subtract 0.5r from both sides, we get

111
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:38,780
10 is equal to 0.2r, or r is equal to 10 over 0.2.

112
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,000
And 10 over 0.2, 0.2 is the same thing as 1/5.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So this is 10 times 5, so that's equal to 50.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,200
So the remainder games were 50,so they want to

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,440
know the total number of games the team plays.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,810
So it's going to be the first 100 games

117
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,030
plus the remainder games.

118
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,940
So 100 plus 50.

119
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,010
They played 150 games,which is choice D.

120
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,070
We're on problem 166.

121
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,720
Of 30 applicants for a job,

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,290
14 had at least 4 years of experience.

123
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,070
So experience greater than 4, we have 14.

124
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,060
I just make up notation as we go.

125
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,050
Of 30 applicants for a job,

126
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,440
14 had at least 4 years of experience,

127
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,920
18 had degrees-- so we say degrees, we have 18--

128
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,210
and 3 had less than 4 years of experience and

129
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,040
did not have a degree.

130
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,900
So experience was less than 4 years' experience

131
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:59,030
and no degree, and that is 3 people.

132
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,160
How many of the applicants had at least 4 years

133
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,040
of experience and a degree?

134
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,890
So let's see how we can think about it.

135
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,880
There's 30 applicants for a job.

136
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,020
So let me draw our universe.

137
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,210
If I did all of the applicants,

138
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,050
let me draw it like this.

139
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,050
So that's the whole applicant universe,

140
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,090
and that's 30

141
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,910
And we know that

142
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,070
14 had more than 4 years of experience.

143
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,050
Let me do that in this color.

144
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:47,660
So this attribute, I'll make it look like that,

145
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,850
so that's the 14

146
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,970
that have experience greater than 4 years.

147
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,040
And that's 14 of them.

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,220
And then 18 have a degree.

149
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,930
And I'm assuming that

150
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,010
there's some overlap between the degrees in the 14

151
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,710
We don't know that for sure, but let's say that

152
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:15,020
this point right here I'll draw another circle.

153
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,070
So let's say that circle looks something like that

154
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,070
So let's call this the degreed people.

155
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,070
And there's 18 of them in this whole circle.

156
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,880
And then they say that there were 3 people

157
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,850
with experience less than 4 and no degree.

158
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,710
So they're outside of both of these circles.

159
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,400
So this right here is 3.

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,090
Now, what are they asking?

161
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,410
I've already forgotten that.

162
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,720
How many of the applicants had

163
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,370
at least 4 years experience and a degree?

164
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:52,070
So they're asking for this intersection right here

165
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,610
So there's one question we can answer.

166
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,310
What's the sum of this population,

167
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,230
the population that

168
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,500
has more than 4 years of experience or a degree?

169
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,580
So let me circle.

170
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,000
What's this sum right here?

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,050
This and this.

172
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,680
It's going to be whatever's left

173
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,610
after you take out the 3 people who have nothing.

174
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,340
So that's going to be 27 people.

175
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:23,020
So 27 people have at least 4 years of

176
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,260
experience or a degree.

177
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,420
Now, how can relate that to the 14 and 18?

178
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:33,070
So what happens if we just add the 14 and the 18?

179
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,580
When we have the 14, we're going to count

180
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,530
these people once.

181
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,570
And if we were add that to 18,

182
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,010
we would count these people twice.

183
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,090
So if we wanted this number--

184
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,990
--if we wanted the number of people

185
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,050
who are in this circle or this circle--

186
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,540
what we would want to do is

187
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,060
add the 14 to the 18, but then subtract out

188
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,030
once the people who are this intersection.

189
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,030
Let's call them B.

190
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,330
That's a B.

191
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,520
I know you can't read it.

192
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,220
Let's say there B people in that intersection.

193
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,400
You'll subtract that out once.

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,010
I want that to really make sense for you.

195
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,340
If we want to know the total number of people

196
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,990
in this circle and this circle combined,

197
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,850
when we say 18 people,

198
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,010
that's including some people here.

199
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,280
And if we were add that to 14 people,

200
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,980
where once again some of those 14 are here again,

201
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,620
are these people.

202
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,620
So when we just add 18 to 14,

203
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,000
we're counting this twice.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,340
So if we want to know the actual number

205
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,010
in the circle or the circle,

206
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,200
since we add 18 to 14 we count it twice,

207
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,000
we wants to subtract these people out once.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hopefully that makes sense.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,420
But anyway, now we're ready to solve.

210
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,950
We get 27 is equal to--14 plus 18 is

211
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,000
equal to 32 minus B.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,800
27 from both sides, you get 0 is equal 5 minus B.

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,750
Add B the both sides.

214
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,580
You get B is equal to 5.

215
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,000
And that is choice E.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,090
See you in the next video.
