00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,221
In the last video we saw how blood sugar concentration, or,

2
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:14,608
glucose concentration in your blood of 80mg/dL

3
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:18,280
was kind of a normal fasting blood glucose, if you hadn't eaten for eight hours --

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,715
or "before a meal," and the fancy word we learned in the last video was 'preprendial.'

5
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,957
What I want to do in this video

6
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:30,646
--because 80mg/dL really does not make a lot of tangible sense to me,

7
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:33,232
I do not know exactly how much sugar that is--

8
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,370
what I want to do is try to put this into different units

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,057
so that we can better conceptualize how much sugar that might be in our bodies.

10
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:43,168
So let us just do a little bit of unit analysis over here.

11
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:49,306
So if we have 80mg/dL--

12
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:54,126
--that's what we're talking about; that's a normal, fasting blood glucose level--

13
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:55,601
now let us think about how much that is per liter.

14
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:58,374
A deciliter is a tenth of a liter.

15
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:03,135
So if we want to cancel out the units, we want dL in the numerator

16
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:09,934
so we want to know dL per L, so that "that" and "that" will cancel out.

17
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:14,380
There are 10 dL's per L.

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:22,547
And so that gives us 80*10 is 800mg per--

19
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,345
--dL's cancel out--

20
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:30,058
800mg per L. Now if we want that in terms of grams,

21
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:34,532
we can just multiple to get rid of that 'mg,' so we put in the denominator,

22
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:41,541
and put 'g' in the numerator. 1g is 1000mg.

23
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:46,928
So, once again, milligrams cancel out, and you have 800/1000.

24
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:52,547
So, 800/1000 is 0.8g/L.

25
00:01:52,547 --> 00:02:04,343
And then to make sense to normal human bodies--I looked this up on the internet--

26
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:11,727
the average human body, I'm assuming--I'm like, 5'9", 150lbs, so I think I'm pretty close to average--

27
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:16,928
but they said that the average human body has about 5L of blood.

28
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:23,940
So let us multiple this...0.8g/L * 5L/average human

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,724
Obviously a smaller human will have less, and a larger human will have more blood flowing through them...

30
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:33,554
But this is an average person right over here, so the Liters cancel out,

31
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:50,736
and so we get 0.8 * 5 = 4, and then we have grams per average human.

32
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,362
4g/human.

33
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:55,938
And just to get an idea of what 4g are:

34
00:02:55,938 --> 00:03:04,761
1 teaspoon is equal to 4.2g. So 4g is almost a teaspoon.

35
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:13,724
So, 4g is approximately 1 teaspoon of glucose per human being.

36
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:19,947
So in your entire bloodstream you have about a teaspoon of sugar that your cells can do whatever your

37
00:03:19,947 --> 99:59:59,999
cells need to do.
