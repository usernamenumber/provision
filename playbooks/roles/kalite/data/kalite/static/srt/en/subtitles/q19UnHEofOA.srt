1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,889
Let's figure out what eleven and twelve
sixteenths minus five in eight

2
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:07,980
sixteenths is. We might have to
simplify it down to lowest terms.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,630
So the way I like to do these is the kind of
separate out the whole number part of

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,949
the mixed numbers from the fractional
part.

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,999
So I can rewrite this number right over
here as eleven

6
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:21,210
plus twelve over sixteen.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,820
And from that I'm going to subtract and
I'll put parentaces here because I'm gonna break

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,079
this part open

9
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,130
I'm going to subtract, I'm going to subtract five plus

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,010
eight over

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,420
sixteen. Five and eight sixteenth, same thing
as five plus eight sixteenth,

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,579
but remember I'm subtracting it

13
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,039
I'm subtracting this whole thing so I
can rewrite it as a rewrite this part

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,980
eleven

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,560
plus twelve over sixteen.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,680
And I'm substracting five plus eigth sixteenth so I can distribute the negative

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,570
sign.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,510
So it's going to be minus five,

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,030
minus five, negative one times five. The
negative one times positive eight sixteenth

20
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,230
so it's going to be minus,

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,830
minus eight over sixteen.

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,890
Minus eight over sixteen. And then I like
to do the whole number part separately

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,040
and the fractional part separately.

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,610
So let's do the whole number parts. We have
eleven minus five, right here, eleven

25
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,350
minus five. Will do that part that's a
whole number part

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,490
and then we have plus

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,600
plus

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,980
twelve sixteenth - let me do this in pink maybe - plus

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,530
twelve sixteenth minus

30
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,060
eight sixteenth

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,000
minus eight

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,630
over sixteen.

33
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,240
And eleven minus five is six.

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,950
And I have six plus - and the denominators are 
same here - so we're gonna get something

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,460
over sixteen

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,370
and twelve minus eight is four.

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,180
So this is the same thing as six plus
four over sixteen, which is the same

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,350
thing as writing is a mixed number

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,350
six and four sixteenths.

40
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,729
Six and four sixteenths. And this is

41
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,000
the right quantity

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,770
but we can simplify it. Four over sixteen
can be simplified. Both the numerator and the

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,420
denominator are divisible by four. They both
have the factor four. Let's divide both

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,419
the numerator and the denominator by four.

45
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:16,870
Divided by four, divided by four, since we're dividing by the same thing we're not

46
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,270
changing its quantity.

47
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,329
And so this is equal to

48
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,410
we still have a whole number part six

49
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,909
but the fraction part is now one,

50
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,369
one over four, so we get six and one
fourth.
