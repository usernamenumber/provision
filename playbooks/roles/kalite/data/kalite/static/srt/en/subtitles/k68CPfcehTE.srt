1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:03,762
Let's try to calculate 3 times 32.

2
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:06,411
And I'd like to rewrite it - and this is one way of doing it -

3
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:10,079
I'd like to rewrite it where I have the larger number of top

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:11,751
(so in this case it's 32)

5
00:00:11,751 --> 00:00:13,423
and I write the smaller number right below it

6
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:17,324
and since the small number is only one digit, it's only a ones digit,

7
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,767
I put that below the ones place on the larger number.

8
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:23,767
So I put the 3 right over here (and of course we cannot forget our multiplication symbol).

9
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,233
And this is essentially way of saying the same thing.

10
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:33,021
You could read this is 32 times 3. But 32 times 3 is exact same value as 3 times 32.

11
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,343
It doesn't matter what order you multiply in.

12
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:36,833
And now let's try to compute it.

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,080
And once again this is only way of doing it. There's many ways of doing it.

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,100
And I want you to think about why this works.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,833
So we'll start with this 3 down here and we're going to multiply times each of the digits in 32.

16
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,107
So we'll start with 3 times 2.

17
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:53,767
Well, 3 times 2...

18
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:58,005
(from our multiplication tables and you could figure it out even if you didn't know your multiplication tables)

19
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:02,603
is 6. So 3 times 2, I'll write 6 right over here in the ones place.

20
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:07,167
Now, we're going figure out what 3 times 3 is.

21
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:11,101
Well, once again we know that 3 times 3 is 9

22
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:17,092
and since I'm multiplying times the tens place right over here I'm going to put it in the tens place right like this.

23
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:21,086
So we're done! We got 32 times 3 is 96.

24
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:24,012
And I really encourage you to think about why this worked.

25
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:28,423
And I give you a little bit of a hint here. I'll give you a little bit of the hint about why this worked:

26
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:39,430
Remember, 3 times 32 is the same thing as 3 times 30 plus 3 times 2.

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,773
And if you look of it that way, that's essentially what this process did.

28
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:46,767
We did 3 times 2 is 6, 3 times 30 is 90.

29
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:50,767
If you add them together, you'll get 90 plus 6 is 96.
