1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,050
We're on problem 195

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,370
and they have drawn a little bit of a grid here.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,050
Let me try to draw it as well.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,030
1, 2, 3.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,030
And then they do this in the other direction.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,000
1, 2, 3.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,570
And they call this First Street.

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,850
And there's actually 4 going that direction.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,030
Let me draw that one.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:31,030
So, there's another street like that.

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,440
And they call this First Street, Second Street,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,500
Third Street, Fourth Street.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,020
And Avenue A, B, and C.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,950
And they say that this point right here--

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,040
I'll do that in a different color.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,080
That point right there is x, and that point right there is y.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,470
Pat will walk from intersection x to intersection y

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,190
along a route that is confined to the square grid of

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,030
4 streets and 3 avenues shown on the map.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,060
How many routes from x to y

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,610
can Pat take that have the minimum possible length?

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,790
So essentially the minimum possible length

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,510
so he doesn't waste time. Right?

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,440
So let's think about it this way.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,740
So he could go this way--

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,820
so we could think about how many different ways

27
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,050
can you get to each point on this graph.

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,550
So to get there, there's one way.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,020
One possible way.

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,520
To get there-- this seems to be a very similar problem to

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,020
what I saw on a Computer Science exam a long, long time ago.

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,280
But there's one way to get there. Right?

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,020
That's obvious.

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,050
So, how many ways are there to get here?

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,500
Well, you can view it as--

36
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,640
well, to go from this path to this path

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,550
and this path to this path,

38
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,180
you can sum the two ways to get there.

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,620
So it's 2. Which makes sense.

40
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,010
You could go like that or you could go like that.

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,720
How many ways are there to go here?

42
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,860
Well, there's only one way to go here. Right?

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,900
Likewise only one way to go here.

44
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,040
Now this is where it gets interesting.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,070
How many ways are there to go here?

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,910
I can either come from there,

47
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,790
and there's only one way to get there, so that's one path.

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,070
Or I could come from here.

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,610
But there's two ways to get here.

50
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,090
So there's two ways to get here via this path,

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,090
and there's one way to get here via this path.

52
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,010
So there are three ways to get here.

53
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,480
So essentially I just added the one and the two.

54
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,610
You think of the same logic here.

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,020
How many ways are there to get there?

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,990
Well, I can come via this path, and that'll be--

57
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,780
there's only one way to get here

58
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,010
so there's only one way to get from this direction.

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,780
Or I could come from this direction,

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,050
but there's two ways to get here.

61
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,020
So there's two ways to come from this direction.

62
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,450
So, there's three ways to get from that direction. Right?

63
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,610
If you use the same logic, there's one way to get here.

64
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,090
You just go straight up.

65
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,040
How many ways are there to get here?

66
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,870
Well, one way to get there, three ways to get there,

67
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,710
so there are four ways to get here

68
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,370
because you can go through that one way

69
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,940
or through these three ways.

70
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,010
So how many ways are there to get here?

71
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,560
You go three ways to there, three ways to there,

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,610
and I can come from either here or here.

73
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,040
So there are six ways.

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,200
So, how many ways to get to y?

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Four ways to get here, six ways to get here, 6 plus 4.

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,740
Ten ways to get here. Right?

77
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,490
I could either come from one of the six ways

78
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,500
from this direction,

79
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,640
or one of the four ways from this direction.

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,980
So ten ways.

81
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,440
And that is choice C.

82
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,310
Next problem.

83
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,020
196.

84
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,100
The ratio, by volume, of soap to alcohol to water

85
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:52,720
in a certain solution is equal to 2:50:100.

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,380
The solution will be altered

87
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,460
so that the ratio of soap to alcohol is doubled,

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,030
while the ratio of soap to water is halved.

89
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Ok. If the altered solution

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,720
will contain 100 cubic centimeters of alcohol,

91
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,070
how many cubic centimeters of water will it contain?

92
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,020
So, let's think about what the new ratio is.

93
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:56,010
The old ratio of soap to alcohol was 2:50.

94
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,440
Now they want to double this ratio. Right?

95
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,030
So the new ratio of soap to alcohol is going to be 4:50.

96
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,510
Fair enough.

97
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:12,010
Now the old ratio of soap to water was 2:100.

98
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,590
Now what's the new ratio of soap to water?

99
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,050
It's going to be halved. Right?

100
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,000
So, that equals soap to water.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,410
We want to half this ratio,

102
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,480
so now the new ratio of soap to water is 1:100. Right?

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,010
So let's see how we can think about it.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,110
Let's try this as a ratio of 4 to something.

105
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,860
So that's the same.

106
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:41,030
1:100 is the same thing as 4:400.

107
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,260
So, let's see if we can rewrite these ratios.

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,320
So the ratio of soap to alcohol to water

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:06:01,020
now becomes 4:50 and the ratio of soap to water is 4:400.

110
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,010
So, they give us alcohol and they want to figure out water.

111
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:14,030
So the ratio of alcohol to water is equal to 50:400.

112
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,000
And that's another way of saying 1:8.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,810
Alcohol to water is equal to 1:8.

114
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,820
And they're saying

115
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,900
that we have 100 cubic centimeters of alcohol.

116
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,750
So, how much water?

117
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,620
So 100 over water is equal to 1:8.

118
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,100
And you can even eyeball that. That's 100 over 800.

119
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,360
So, water has to be equal to 800 cubic centimeters.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,070
And that's choice E.

121
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,000
Next question.

122
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,010
197.

123
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,080
If 75% of a class answered the first question on a test

124
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:06,600
correctly-- so 75%, let's say 3/4, question one correctly.

125
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,990
55% answered the second question on the test correctly.

126
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,010
Let me write it this way.

127
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,010
Question one, 75% true.

128
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,960
Question two, 55% answered the second question correctly,

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,420
and 20% answered neither of the questions correctly.

130
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,050
So three, 20%.

131
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,620
So, that's not question three.

132
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,510
20% neither.

133
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,020
What percent answered both correctly?

134
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,790
So 3/4 answered question one correctly

135
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,930
and 1/4 answered it incorrectly.

136
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,080
Q1, they got it wrong.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,950
They're telling us that 20% got neither correct.

138
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,580
So that means that they got Q2 wrong, as well.

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,050
And this is 20% of the entire population.

140
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,020
So this is 1/5.

141
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,020
This is 1/5 of the entire population.

142
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,260
So my question is, if this is 1/5 of the entire population,

143
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,610
what fraction of this population was it?

144
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,830
Well, of these people, the fraction that got Q2 incorrect,

145
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,030
let's write that as x.

146
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,070
So, x times 1/4 is equal to 1/5.

147
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,070
Multiply both sides by a fourth, you get x is equal 4/5.

148
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,750
So, what we know is

149
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,600
since this is 1/5 of the entire population,

150
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,850
that of the people who got question one incorrect,

151
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,950
4/5 also got question two incorrect. Right?

152
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,200
And if you want to know what percentage

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,790
that is of the whole population, multiply 1/4 times 4/5.

154
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,920
And you get 1/5 which is that data that they had given us.

155
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,850
But this helps us.

156
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,810
Because this tells us,

157
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,270
of these people who got question one incorrect,

158
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,810
what fraction got it right?

159
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,040
Got question two right?

160
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,020
Well, if 4/5 got it wrong, 1/5 got question two correct.

161
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,380
So let me just take a step back.

162
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,270
I want to make sure

163
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm not doing this the slowest possible way.

164
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,650
They tell us that 75% got question one right

165
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,030
and 55% got question two right.

166
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,630
Ok. So let's think about it.

167
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:38,670
So of this, some percentage got question two wrong. Right?

168
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,700
Actually, let's think of it this way.

169
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,070
Of this, some percentage got question two right.

170
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,470
Let's call this y.

171
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,850
Let's call that y and let's call this--

172
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,000
Well. I'm going to use x again.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,020
Let's call this x.

174
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,070
I'll use x. This is a different x.

175
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,550
So, first of all, what is the total proportion of people

176
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,380
who got question one wrong and then question two right?

177
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,010
Well, it's 1/4 times 1/5.

178
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,350
So, it's 1/20 of the people got question one wrong

179
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,680
and question two right.

180
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
And that's equal to x.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,920
Now, what percentage of the people got question one right

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,630
and question two wrong?

183
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,050
Well, that's going to be y. RightŁż

184
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,500
Now if you think about--

185
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,240
and y is actually what we're solving for.

186
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,080
They want to know how many students answered both correctly.

187
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,420
So, if you think about it,

188
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,500
y plus 1/20, that represents all of the people

189
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,680
who answered question two correctly.

190
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,210
All the people who answered question two correctly--

191
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,590
I know it's a little confusing--

192
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,090
are those people and those people.

193
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,840
That's all the question twos answered correctly.

194
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,310
We already know that this is 1/20 of the population.

195
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,720
And we know that y plus 1/20 of the population

196
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,760
is equal to 55% of the population.

197
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,520
So, we can write that as 55 over 100.

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,600
Or, we could divide both by 5 and you get 11 over 20.

199
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
This is 11/20 of the population.

200
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,870
So, what is y?

201
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,210
Well, subtract 1/20 from both sides. y is equal to--

202
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:31,070
11/20 minus 1/20 is equal to 10/20, which is equal to 1/2.

203
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:37,000
So, 1/2 of the population got both the first and the second

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,930
question right.

205
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,480
Actually, we didn't even have to use--

206
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,430
well, we did have to use this 3/4 information

207
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,970
to get this 1/4 here.

208
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,780
But anyway.

209
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,560
And let's see if that's one of the choices.

210
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:46,930
Right.

211
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,320
D.

212
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,010
50%.

213
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,460
And I'm all out of time.

214
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,030
See you in the next video.
