99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do in this video now that we have

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
displacement as a function of time

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
given constant acceleration and initial velocity

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to plot displacement, the velocity, I should say

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the final velocity, and acceleration. All those are functions of time.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just so you really understand what's

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
happening

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the ball is going up and then down

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we know this is our discplacement, as a function of time

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We know what are final velocity is going to be, as a funtion of time.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We talked about it in the last video. Our final velocity is going to be our intial velocity
