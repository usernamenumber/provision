1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,000
We're on problem 80.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,030
If a,b, and c are integers,is a minus b, plus c greater-- OK.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:21,000
So what they want to know is a minus b, plus c greater than

4
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:30,200
a plus b, minus c? Fair enough. And if you think about it,

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,440
there's an a on both sides of this equation.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,020
So what they're really wanting to know is minus b plus c

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,620
greater than b minus c?

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,350
Or another way, they're just trying to say--

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,720
I just took a from both sides of this inequality,

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,040
so it doesn't change anything.

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,790
Really what they're asking, if you just rearrange this,

12
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,440
is c minus b greater than b minus c?

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,020
Which is another way of saying,

14
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,150
well, is one of them greater than the other one? Right?

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,280
If c is greater than b,

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,820
this is going to be greater than this one.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,730
If b is greater than c,

18
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,480
this is going to be greater than this one.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,690
So let's look at our statements now.

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,170
Statement number one. b is negative.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,710
Well, that by itself doesn't help us much because b could

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,070
be negative, but c could be even more negative.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,220
So c could still be smaller than b, right?

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,470
If b could be minus 5, c could be minus 6.

25
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,680
Or c could be plus 6.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,500
So it really tells us nothing about c relative to b.

27
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,140
Statement two says c is positive.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,730
So this statement by itself, once again, it tells us

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,430
nothing about the value of b relative to c.

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,820
If c is positive, maybe b is positive as well.

31
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,500
Maybe b is more positive. Or maybe b is negative. Who knows?

32
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,550
But this by itself doesn't help us.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,110
But if we use both of these together,

34
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,230
if c is positive and b is negative, then we know,

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,430
if this is positive, this is negative,

36
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,380
we know this is going to be positive.

37
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,080
And we know that this is going to be negative.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,460
Essentially, we know that c is larger than b,

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,930
so this will be positive and this will be negative.

40
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,100
And we can answer our question.

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,610
If c is larger than b, this is true.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,090
The left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side, or

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,820
this holds good. So we need both of the statements together.

44
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,810
Both statements together are sufficient to answer

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,750
this question.

46
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,020
Switch colors. 81.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:37,240
If a certain animated cartoon consists of a total of 17,280

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,750
frames on film, how many minutes will it take to run

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,030
the cartoon? So they want to know how many minutes.

50
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,450
So essentially, if we knew how fast the frames have to go

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,660
through--if it's x frames per second--if we knew that number,

52
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,010
we'd be able to figure out how long the cartoon runs.

53
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,750
So statement one is, the cartoon runs without

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,030
interruption at a rate of 24 frames per second. Well,

55
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,460
that's exactly what I just asked for. 24 frames per second.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,590
So using just that information, how many seconds does it run?

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,460
Well, it runs 17,280 frames divided by 24 frames per second.

58
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,800
This will give you seconds, and then if you divide this

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,790
number by 60, you'll get minutes.

60
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,190
Divide seconds by 60, you get minutes. So this is the answer.

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,430
So one alone was enough to answer the question.

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,080
What does statement two give us? I'll write it here.

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Statement two.

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,000
It takes 6 times as long to run the cartoon as it takes to

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
rewind the film.And it takes a total of 14 minutes to do both

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,240
6 times as long to run the cartoon as it takes to rewind.

67
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,640
Let's say 6 times to play. I want different letters.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,420
So to play the cartoon takes 6 times as long as

69
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,010
to rewind the cartoon.

70
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,940
And they say it takes a total of 14 minutes to do both.

71
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,060
So they say play plus rewind is equal to 14.

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,990
And what we want to know is,

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,480
how long does it take to play the movie?

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,920
And we don't even have to use that information alone,

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,800
the 17,280, but just looking at this, we have two linear

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,400
equations and two unknowns, so we can just solved for P.

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,920
P is the playtime of this movie.

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,960
And if you wanted to figure it out-- not that you would have

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,260
to, because we would be done at this point.

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,670
We would say oh, one and two are each independently

81
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,080
sufficient to answer this question.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,030
But just to show you that we could figure it out.

83
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,490
Say R is equal to 14 minus P.

84
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,330
Then you substitute that into that.

85
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,000
You get P is equal to 6 times R.o 6 times 14 is 60, plus 24.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,900
84 minus 6P. You get 7P is equal to 84.

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,670
P is equal to 12 minutes. And we'd be done.

88
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,720
But actually, we didn't have to do all of that.

89
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,040
All of that is a waste of time.

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:16,640
I just want to prove it to you. 82.

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,540
A box contains only red chips, white chips, and blue chips.

92
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,440
If a chip is randomly selected from the box, what is the

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,020
probability that the chip will either be white or blue?

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,120
So essentially, to answer this, we just have to know

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,010
what proportion of the chips in the bag are white or blue.

96
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,940
All right. So statement one says,

97
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,020
the probability that the chip will be blue is 1/5.

98
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,650
So probability of blue is equal to 1/5.

99
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,000
That also tells us that 1/5 of the chips in the bag are blue.

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,730
But we don't know what proportion are white, so we

101
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,440
still can't answer that top question. Statement two tells us,

102
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,030
the probably that the chip will be red is 1/3.

103
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,020
The probability of red is equal to 1/3.

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,750
So, once again, just this alone-- actually,

105
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,010
just this alone is fine, right? I correct myself.

106
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,000
The probability of getting white or blue,

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,590
that's probability of white--we could write, do set notation,

108
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,660
white or blue-- that is just equal to what?

109
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,040
It's 1 minus the probability that we get a red.

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,490
Think about that.

111
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,970
Either this is going to be true, I'm going to pick a

112
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,290
white or blue, or I'm going to pick a red.

113
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,900
Because there's only red, white,and blue in the bag.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,400
So the probability of white or blue is equal to 1 minus the

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,350
probability of red, which is equal to 1 minus 1/3,

116
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,010
which is equal to 2/3. So statement two alone is sufficient.

117
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,740
And then if we have statement number two,

118
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,090
statement one alone is not sufficient. 83.

119
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,180
See, this is tricky because, I think, at least when I first

120
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,410
read it, I was like, oh, I could use this and this to

121
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,400
figure out the probably of getting a white.

122
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,210
So I need both statements.

123
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,060
But we don't even need to know the probability of a white.

124
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,970
We just need to know the probably a white or a blue,

125
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,060
which is just 1 minus the probability of red.

126
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,000
So statement two alone gets us there.

127
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,560
Let me do the next problem. 83.

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
If the successive tick marks on the number line are equally

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
spaced, and if x and y are the numbers designating the

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,010
endpoints of the interval as shown, what is the value of y?

131
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,030
OK, so let me see if I can draw what they have drawn.

132
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,420
So they have a number line.

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,640
And I probably have to draw the exact same number of ticks

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,060
as they did.

135
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,540
So they have 0. And then let's see, there's 1 tick, 2 ticks,

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,010
and then they have a third tick. And they say this is x.

137
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:04,000
And then they have three more. 1, 2, 3. And then they have y.

138
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,070
And then they have one more. And this keeps going on and on.

139
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:14,520
And they ask us, if the ticks are equally spaced, and if x

140
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,800
and y are the numbers designated at the endpoints of

141
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,880
intervals as shown, what is the value of y?

142
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,250
So they're equally spaced, but they're not telling us that

143
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,980
these are integers.

144
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,490
We don't know that this is 1, this is 2, this is 3.

145
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,030
We don't know that.

146
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:35,020
But what we do know is y is how much further than x?

147
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,880
So let's see, x is 1, 2, 3 spaces.

148
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,720
So we could say x is equal to 3 times, let's say, s,

149
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,000
where s is the length of each interval, or each tick.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,820
And y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So y is equal to 7s. And so

151
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,220
we could use this to come up with a relation with x and y.

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,470
This is before they've done anything.

153
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,620
This is just looking at the diagram.

154
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,000
So we could say that s is equal to y/7.

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,500
Or if we substitute this back here, we could say that x is

156
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,610
equal 3/7 y.

157
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,740
And actually, you didn't have to even do this s stuff.

158
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,100
You could have just said, oh, well,

159
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,300
x is 3/7 as far as y is from 0.

160
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,610
Because these are equally spaced.

161
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,000
So just the problem setup, just looking at it,

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,490
gives us that information.

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,200
But we want to know what the value of y is,

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,460
and that by itself isn't enough.

165
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,010
What does statement one tell us? x is equal to 1/2.

166
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,730
Well, that's enough to figure out y.

167
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,580
If x is equal to 1/2, you just substitute there.

168
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,570
1/2 is equal to 3/7 y. Multiply both sides by 7/3.

169
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,380
You get y is equal to what? 7/6. And you're done.

170
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,150
You don't have to solve that. You just know that I have this,

171
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,380
I have that. I can solve it. So one alone is sufficient.

172
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:10,050
Statement two tells us, y minus x is equal to 2/3.

173
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,590
So once again,we have two linear equations with two unknowns.

174
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,820
We can just substitute and solve them.

175
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,880
And just to prove it to you, x is equal to 3/7 y.

176
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,190
I can substitute that right there.

177
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:32,140
So I have y minus 3/7 y is equal to 2/3. So 7/7 minus 3/7.

178
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,140
So that's just to go here.

179
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:42,030
7/7 y, so that's 4/7 y is equal to 2/3.

180
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,560
y is equal to 2/3 times 7/4.

181
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:56,030
Which is-- that's 1, this is 2-- which is 7/6 once again.

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,490
See you in the next video.

183
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,630
So once again, each of these are independently sufficient

184
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,010
to answer the question. See you soon.
