1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,770
Welcome back. We're on problem number twelve.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,390
The perimeter of a rectangular plot of land is 250 meters.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,810
If the length of one side of the plot is 40 meters,

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,900
what is the area of the plot in square meters?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,650
So let me draw a rectangle here.

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,320
We know that one side of the plot is 40 meters,right?

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,090
Well it's a rectangle.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,330
So if this side is 40,then this side is also going to be 40.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,540
And let's say we don't know the other side.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,610
Well if this side is x, this is also x.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,670
So what is the perimeter,expressed in these terms?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,840
What's 40 plus 40, which is 80, plus x plus x,right?

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,790
So if 80 plus 2x is the perimeter,

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,420
and we know that the perimeter is 250.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,980
And so solving for x we get 2x is equal to,

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,250
what's 250 minus 80, that's 170.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,070
At that x is equal to 85.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,350
And now if we want to get the area of this,

19
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,050
we just multiply the base times the height.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:29,640
So 85 times 40, put a 0 here,and 4 times 5 is 20.

21
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,030
4 times 8 is 32, plus 2 is 34.

22
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,670
So the area is 3400 square meters.

23
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,720
I hope I didn't do something wrong with the math,

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,820
but I think you get the point.

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,370
Next problem. Problem thirteen.

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,050
A school ordered $600 worth of light bulbs.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,200
Some of the light bulbs cost $1 each, and others cost $2.

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,640
So some were $1, some were $2 each.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,580
If twice as many $1 bulbs as $2 bulbs were ordered,

30
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,900
how many light bulbs were ordered all together?

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,110
Fascinating.

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,160
So let's let x equal number of $1 bulbs.

33
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,480
I could introduce a variable y,

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,710
but I could just say that x is the number of $1 bulbs,

35
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,460
and we know that

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,580
twice as many $1 bulbs as $2 bulbs were ordered,right?

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,860
So how can I express the number of $2 bulbs?

38
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,560
Well we know that

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,310
twice as many $1 bulbs were ordered as $2 bulbs.

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,250
So this would be x divided by 2.

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,450
There are half as many $2 bulbs as $1 bulbs,right?

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,520
And we know that if we add up the total number of bulbs,

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,690
well actually we don't know.

44
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,140
So what is the total cost if we get x $1 bulbs,

45
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,950
and if we get x divided by 2 $2 bulbs?

46
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,320
What is going to be the total cost of this?

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,210
Well, I'm going to get x $1 bulbs,

48
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,290
and they're each going to cost $1.

49
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,700
Plus, I'm going to get x over 2 $2 bulbs,

50
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
and they're each going to cost $2.

51
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,840
And when I add it all up it's going to equal $600.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,410
So x times 1 is, of course, x.

53
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,140
And then x over 2 times 2,that's lucky that worked out,

54
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,900
plus x is equal to $600. So 2x is equal to 600.

55
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,400
x is equal to 300.

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,870
And they want to know

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,610
how many lightbulbs were ordered all together.

58
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:54,450
So we got 300 $1 bulbs,and we got 1/2 as many $2 bulbs,right?

59
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,590
x divided by 2.

60
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:04,100
So we got 150 $2 bulbs. So together we got 450 bulbs.

61
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,560
Next problem. Image clear.

62
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,990
I'll do it in a new color so we don't get bored.

63
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,670
Fourteen.

64
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:31,280
If 4 times x plus y times x minus y is equal to 40,

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,460
and we also know that x minus y is equal to 20,

66
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,650
what is the value of x plus y?

67
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,220
Well, we know x minus y is equal to 20,

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,520
so we can just substitute that right here.

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,730
So then we get 4 times x plus y times,

70
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,730
instead of writing x minus y we can just write times 20,

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,860
is equal to 40.

72
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,040
Or, if we multiply 20 times 4,

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,890
we know that 80 times x plus y is equal to 40.

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,900
Then we know, divide both sides by 80,

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
and we get x plus y is 40 over 80.

76
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Which is the same thing as 1/2.

77
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,660
And that's our answer. x plus y is equal to 1/2.

78
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,780
Next problem. Fifteen.

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,070
In a rectangular coordinate system,

80
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,260
that's what we're familiar with,

81
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,970
the center of a circle has coordinates 5, 12.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,790
So I draw a circle,

83
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,840
and then the center of the circle has the coordinates 5, 12.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,600
And the circle touches the x-axis at one point only.

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,530
What is the radius of the circle?

86
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,480
So it just touches the x-axis.

87
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,080
And the only place where it can

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,930
touch the x-axis only in one point is this exact.

89
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,310
Because the x-axis is essentially a horizontal line,right?

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,860
And where else can you touch the x-axis?

91
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,410
You could touch it here, on top.

92
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,010
But if the x-axis was up here,

93
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,930
then the y coordinate would not be positive.

94
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,990
So this has a positive y coordinate,

95
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,720
so we know it has to be above the x-axis,it's at 12.

96
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,610
So we know the only place where you can touch the x-axis

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,990
just once is right here, just right at the bottom.

98
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,400
So it's gotta be like that. That's gotta be the x-axis.

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,700
That could be the x-axis

100
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,720
and then the y-axis could be out here someplace.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Just so you have a frame of reference.

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,870
And if that's the x-axis,then what's the radius?

103
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:39,760
Well, this is the point 5,12, this is y equals 12.

104
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,220
So what is this height? This is a radius.

105
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,500
Well that's just the y-coordinate, it's 12.

106
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,940
So the radius is equal to 12.

107
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,900
They're just saying what is the radius of the circle,

108
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,130
well, the radius is 12. It's the y-coordinate.

109
00:06:52,730 --> 00:07:02,070
Next problem. Whoops. I say whoops a lot. Problem sixteen.

110
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,820
They have this men, women,woman,

111
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,230
and then they say voting age population.

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,900
So population, and then registered,

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:29,310
and they say 1200, 1000, 1300, and 1200.

114
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,030
They say,

115
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,690
the table above gives the voter registration data

116
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,590
for the town of Bridgeton at the time of a recent election.

117
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,820
In the election,

118
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,360
40% of the voting age population actually voted.

119
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,780
So this is the voting age population.

120
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,050
And we know that 40% actually voted.

121
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,160
If the turnout for the election is defined by the number

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:02,050
who actually voted,divided by registered,

123
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,730
what was the turnout for this election?

124
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,650
So what's the number who actually voted?

125
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,860
It's 40% of the voting age population.

126
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,970
So what's the voting age population?

127
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,850
Well the total population is the men and women,

128
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,430
so that's 2500.

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,290
Just add these two up. And what's 40% of 2500?

130
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:29,230
That's 2500 times 0.4. Let's see. 4 times 25 is 100.

131
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,570
Two more zeros. 0, 0.

132
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,060
And then, of course,one decimal. So it's 1000.

133
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,810
I just took 40% of 2500. 1000 people voted.

134
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,110
And if we want to know the turnout,

135
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,550
we just have to say the number voted, which is 1000,

136
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,940
divided by the registered voters.

137
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,850
Well the registered voters,there's 1000 men, 1200 women,

138
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,720
so you add that up.

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,910
That's 2200 total registered voters.

140
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:06,540
That's the same thing as 10/22, or 5/11.

141
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,290
That's our answer. That's the fraction that voted.

142
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,340
That's what they wanted.

143
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,700
To find to be the fraction,

144
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,950
so you can write it as this fraction, 5/11.

145
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,730
I'll see you in the next video,

146
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,970
hopefully I didn't make them mad there.

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
See you in the next video.
