1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,060
We're asked how many toothpicks
will be needed to

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,120
form the 50th figure
in this sequence?

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,010
And they've drawn the first four
figures in the sequence.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,220
This is the first, the
second, the third.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,690
Now, let's see what's
happening here.

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,050
So in this first figure, we have
this nice little house

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,510
that they've made out of
toothpicks, and it has one,

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:24,110
two, three, four, five,
six toothpicks.

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,910
So the first figure in our
sequence has six toothpicks.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,170
Now, what happens in the
second figure here?

12
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,010
Well, it looks just like
our first figure.

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,510
We have our one, two, three,
four, five, six toothpicks,

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,340
but then they add
some toothpicks.

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,890
It looks like they added one,
two, three, four, five,

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,650
toothpicks.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,040
So it's 6 plus 5 or
11 toothpicks.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,490
So let me write this down.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:01:00,360
It is the 6 toothpicks plus 5
more, which is equal to 11

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,300
toothpicks.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,580
And then when we go to the third
figure, it looks just

22
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,510
like the second figure, so it
has the 11 toothpicks, so the

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,510
11 toothpicks are one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,360
eight, nine, ten, eleven, just
like the second figure.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,970
And then they add some more.

26
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,160
They add one, two, three,
four, five.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,810
So it looks like every time,
when you draw part of a

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,560
another house, because it can
share a wall with the previous

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,240
house or share a toothpick
with the previous set of

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,340
houses, you add five
toothpicks.

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,860
So for the third term in our
sequence, we had 11 and when

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,160
we had our second term,
or our two houses, and

33
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,940
then we add five more.

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,860
   

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,040
So to our 50th term, so 11
plus 5 is going to be 16.

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
And then for the fourth term,
it's going to be 16 plus 5,

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,890
which is equal to 21.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,550
Now, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

39
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,830
You can think about however
many more you are than 1.

40
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,780
So let's say you are in the
nth term of the sequence.

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,540
If you are in the nth term,
however more you are than 1,

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,280
so if you're the nth term,
you're going to be n minus 1

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,790
more than 1.

44
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,620
If that is confusing, we'll do
it with real numbers, so it

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,320
gets a little bit
more tangible.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:34,010
So the nth term, you are n minus
1 more or greater than--

47
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,210
I'll just say more-- than 1.

48
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,950
For example, if n is 2,
you are 1 more than 1.

49
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,320
If n is 3, you are 3 minus 1,
which is 2 more than 1.

50
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,230
So however much more
you are than 1, you

51
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,890
multiply that by 5.

52
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,510
We're 2 more than 1, so we add
10 to the number of toothpicks

53
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,130
we have here.

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,070
We're 3 more than 1 here, so
we add 15 to the number of

55
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,290
toothpicks we have there.

56
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,090
So you could say that for the
nth term, the number of

57
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:15,560
toothpicks is equal to the
number you're more than 1, 00:03:19,730
minus 1 times 5.

58
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,210
That's how much you're going
to add above and beyond the

59
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,930
amount of toothpicks
in just the first

60
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,880
sequence, so times 5.

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,860
n minus 1 times 5 plus the
number of toothpicks that you

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,840
would just have in the
first sequence or

63
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,150
just this one house.

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,850
And we already counted
that: plus 6.

65
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,200
So that's one way to
think about it.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,560
And if this looks complicated,
you just say, well, look, if I

67
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,060
put a 4 here, I'm 3 more than
1, so 4 minus 1 is 3, so

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,810
that'll be 3 times
5, which is 15.

69
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,335
And then you add the number
of toothpicks in 1 and

70
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,370
then you get 6.

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,060
Now another way, and many of you
all might find this easier

72
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,870
to think about, is even in 1,
you could imagine a term

73
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,850
here-- let me do it this way.

74
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,170
You can imagine a term here
that they didn't draw.

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,360
You can imagine a 0th term.

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Let me just draw it here.

77
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,990
Imagine a 0th term, and the 0th
term would just be kind of

78
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,640
a left wall of the house, or
in this case, the left

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,839
toothpick of a house.

80
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,130
And then the first one, you're
adding 5 toothpicks to that.

81
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,340
In the second one, you're adding
5 toothpicks to that.

82
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,450
And when you think about it this
way, it actually becomes

83
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,620
a little simpler to think
in terms of n.

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,530
Here, you could say, well, the
nth term-- let me do this in a

85
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,090
different color.

86
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,895
You could say that the nth term
is going to have-- or

87
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:53,180
maybe we should say number of
toothpicks in nth figure is

88
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,700
going to be equal to 1.

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,320
So in the 0th figure, which I
just made up, you have at

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,560
least 1 toothpick, and then
whatever term in the sequence

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,010
you are, you multiply that times
5 and you add that to

92
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,010
the number of toothpicks in the
0th figure, so it's 1 plus

93
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,380
5 times n, which is actually a
simpler way to think about.

94
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,360
The first figure is going to
be that 1 in the 0th figure

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,130
plus 5: 6 toothpicks.

96
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,640
Even in the 0th figure,
it works out.

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,510
If you put a 0 here,
0 plus 1 is 1.

98
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,670
If you put the fourth figure
here, 5 times 4 is

99
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,160
20 plus 1 is 21.

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,930
Now let's answer
their question.

101
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,380
We need to figure out the
toothpicks in the 50th figure

102
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,100
in the sequence.

103
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,900
Well, we just put
50 for n here.

104
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,840
So for the 50th figure, we
could use either formula.

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,380
We have 1 plus 5 times 50.

106
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,370
5 times 50 is 250 plus
1 is equal to 251.

107
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,310
And now I said you could use
either formula because they

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,456
should reduce to each other, if
we did our math right or if

109
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:00,900
we deduced properly.

110
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,160
So this one up here, let's just
verify this is the same

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,660
thing as this over here.

112
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:13,870
If we multiply 5 times n minus
1, we get 5n minus 5, right?

113
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,290
We just distributed the 5.

114
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,690
And then we have that plus 6.

115
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,240
Negative 5 plus 6 is plus 1.

116
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,740
So it's 5n plus 1
or 1 plus 5n.

117
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,480
Either way, your 50th figure
is going to have 251.

118
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,933
