1
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:03,945
There's been a lot of talk lately about the fiscal cliff

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:06,177
which sounds very dramatic

3
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:07,819
and what I want to do in this video is

4
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:11,012
at least lay out the numbers so that we are all on the same page, and then

5
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:12,162
in the next few videos

6
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:14,320
think about the implications

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,239
or how the negotiations between the President and the Congress might actually work out.

8
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,113
so the first thing to frame this conversation is

9
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:24,591
just where the budget is right now

10
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,746
so let me draw a little graph

11
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:33,419
so let me make this axis right over here represent our budget

12
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,173
now I want to make this as big as possible

13
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:37,157
so that we can get a little bit of granular detail

14
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:42,977
on how much the budge might move based on how the negotiations work out

15
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:47,099
so let's say that this line is roughly 4 trillion dollars long

16
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:52,033
so that's 4 trillion, and half way would be about 2 trillion

17
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,658
and between 2 and 4, you got 3 trillion

18
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:58,914
then 1 trillion would be right over here.

19
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:00,703
1 trillion

20
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:04,766
then I'm going to do some bar charts to show the different scenarios.

21
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:08,753
and as I do this, keep in mind the size of the US economy

22
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:13,846
the US economy is approximately 15.5 trillion dollars

23
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:18,897
so that is roughly our GDP, depends on which year you're measuring

24
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:22,251
but that gives us at least a frame of reference for

25
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:29,167
what chunk of GDP we are talking about when we talk about the federal budget.

26
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:36,412
So let's start with the 2012 budget.

27
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:42,615
So in 2012, the US government is spending 3.6 trillion dollars.

28
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:46,102
So let me make my graph a little more granular

29
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,113
so this would be 3.5

30
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:51,112
so 3.6 would be right around here.

31
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,402
so let me draw that

32
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:56,951
and I'll do it in... I'll do this purple color for the expenditures

33
00:01:56,951 --> 00:02:01,619
so this is how much the federal government

34
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,403
spent, or I guess is spending in 2012

35
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:09,467
so~ just like that

36
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:13,046
Alright. There we go. So that's expenditures.

37
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,365
Now, you are probably aware,

38
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,150
that we don't have all of the revenue

39
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,762
we didn't bring in 3.6 trillion in taxes,

40
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:24,168
so this right over here is 3.6 trillion

41
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:28,518
our revenue that we get through tax revenue and other things is somewhat less

42
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:35,849
It in 2012 was on the order of 2.5 trillion.

43
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:38,433
So I'll draw that right over here,

44
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,614
so 2.5 trillion and I'll do it in this green color

45
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:46,971
So this is how much revenue was brought in,

46
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,313
so let me write this down.

47
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:54,394
This is 2.5 trillion

48
00:02:54,394 --> 00:03:00,278
Now let's think about how much might get spent under the different scenarios.

49
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:06,187
So first I'll layout a rough approximation of Obama's budget proposal for 2013.

50
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:11,401
So Obama in 2013.

51
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,720
So on the spending side,

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,519
he sees, or would like to see spending go up by 200 billion

53
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,982
so let's see this,

54
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:26,120
so on the spending side, we're going to add 200 billion

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,087
and in the next few videos, we could talk the pros and cons,

56
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:31,298
the arguments for and against, something like that

57
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,633
so let me draw that

58
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:45,187
so relative to the 3.6, we're now at 3.8

59
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:48,514
so this, you have a spending increase of...

60
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:58,116
so plus 200 billion, that gets us to 3.8 trillion in total expenditures

61
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:03,753
If my best estimate of what what the Republicans in Congress would want,

62
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:07,016
so let's write... let's say Republican-

63
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:09,818
Republicans in 2013 is that they would actually-

64
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:13,000
ideally wants spending cuts from these levels

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,319
so let's draw that out...

66
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,001
and roughly on the order of about 100 billion

67
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,167
so roughly on the order of 100 billion- and they might want even more than that

68
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,628
but let's just go with that for now.

69
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:27,880
So that gets us to a budget of 3.5 trillion.

70
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,782
so that's about that right over there

71
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:37,800
3.5 trillion

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,631
so once again, relative to 2012

73
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,994
you're going down by 100 billion (let me make that clear)

74
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,784
you're going- you're subtracting 100 billion

75
00:04:49,784 --> 00:04:52,848
now in the Fiscal Cliff scenario

76
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:59,214
the Fiscal Cliff scenario, the spending will be similar to the Republican ideal right over here

77
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:02,332
so let me write this right over here: Fiscal Cliff

78
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:05,717
Fiscal cliff- we are also spending-

79
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:10,447
we are cutting on the order of 100 billion in government expenditures

80
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,072
so let's draw that

81
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:14,785
so at least on the expenditure side-

82
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:16,695
and these are all very rough

83
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:19,047
I'm sure that there're Republicans who'd agree and disagree with this

84
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,546
but I'm trying to get my best sense of...

85
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:26,685
kind of an aggregate view on things

86
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:33,164
so... the fiscal cliff- we are also cutting spending by 100 billion.

87
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:39,946
by one- so we are cutting by 100 billion

88
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:43,313
Now, let's go to the revenue side of things.

89
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:46,447
In all these scenarios for 2013,

90
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:50,229
and just to be clear, the fiscal cliff- that's also for 2013

91
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,628
in all of these scenarios, we get the same revenue

92
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:58,197
from... that we got in 2012- let me draw that

93
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:02,535
plus we get another 100 billion from the growth in the economy

94
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:05,787
As the economy grows, and if you're tax rates are completely constant

95
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:08,583
you're also going to get more more revenue for the federal government

96
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:13,634
so you get about 100 billion, you get 100 billion from the federal government

97
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:16,816
so that get's us to 2.6 trillion,

98
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:21,280
2.6 trillion without changing anything

99
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
so let me just shade all of these in really fast

100
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,834
so that takes us to 2.6 trillion

101
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,452
so let's shade that at one end

102
00:06:30,452 --> 00:06:32,582
shade that one end

103
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:36,265
and then shade that one end.

104
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:39,930
Now, as you probably heard on the news

105
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,999
Obama would like to extend the Bush tax cuts for the middle class,

106
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:52,611
and he considers the middle class those who are making less than 250 thousand dollars for a family

107
00:06:52,611 --> 00:07:04,382
but he would like to not extend the bush tax cuts on the ridge and like to actually include a few other tax increases also on the wealthy

108
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:11,662
and so you would get an increase of revenue, under Obama's plan, of 300 billion

109
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:14,747
300 billion- and this is once again very rough

110
00:07:14,747 --> 00:07:19,935
there's probably 50, 60 billion that I'm not fully accounting for

111
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,765
but it will give you the rough picture

112
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,613
so this is 300 billion

113
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,620
and what Obama's doing here

114
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,728
or at least in the proposal, as far as I can gleam

115
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,218
none of it is that simple

116
00:07:30,218 --> 00:07:32,865
what they're talking about right over here

117
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:39,545
is extend the tax cuts for middle class

118
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:42,514
...for middle class...

119
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:44,850
which my best reading seems like,

120
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,664
we would lose a little under 200 billion of revenue

121
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:51,238
but then we keep the tax cuts

122
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:56,146
or we... we let the tax cuts on the wealthy expire

123
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,907
so that gets us 200 of this

124
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,891
\and there are other tax increases,

125
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:03,022
and other (mumble) I guess removing loopholes

126
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:06,707
and whatever else that increases this to 300 billion

127
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,372
So let's compare the deficit

128
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:10,240
let's compare the deficit, so this gets us to-

129
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,025
in the Obama scenario we end up with 2.9 trillion in revenue

130
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:20,294
So let's compare what the deficit did from 2012 to Obama's budget plan

131
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:27,729
So in 2012 you take 3.6 billion and subtract out 2.5 trillion

132
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:32,739
there's a gap of 1.1 trillion

133
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:37,842
This is the deficit- this is how much the government has to borrow in 2012

134
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:41,190
Under Obama's budget, what would be for 2013?

135
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,472
Well, we're spending 3.8 trillion,

136
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:46,576
we are getting 2.9 trillion

137
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:51,962
so you have a gap of 900 billion.

138
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:53,725
900 billion

139
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,192
He- so there is some deficit reduction

140
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:59,523
although the deficit is still quite large

141
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,439
the deficit reduction is 200 billion

142
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,012
100 billion of that came from economic growth

143
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:12,705
and then the rest is coming from ... a good chunk of that is coming from increased taxes

144
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:16,041
or letting- depending on how you view it- either increase taxes on the wealthy

145
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:20,623
or not letting the tax cuts expire on the wealthy

146
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:22,800
Now let's think about the Republican situation

147
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,328
Well you have 2.6 trillion in revenue

148
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:29,979
and you have 3.5 trillion (and let me write this down)

149
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:35,253
you have 3.5 trillion in expenditure

150
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:44,129
and once again you have on the order of 900 billion gap

151
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,671
so in terms of deficit reduction, these things look pretty similar

152
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,773
you have a very similar deficit

153
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,810
Obama is increasing spending

154
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,170
and he would argue that he is investing in things that might help stimulate the economy

155
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,826
or invest in America for the future

156
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:02,922
and then he is making it up by letting the tax cuts on the wealthy expire for the most part

157
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:05,405
The Republicans want to cut spending

158
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,485
but they're also letting the tax cuts continue

159
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:12,561
so you essentially have the same level of deficit reduction

160
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:16,997
Now, I think we are ready to talk about the Fiscal Cliff.

161
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:21,369
The Fiscal Cliff- we're spending 100 billion less

162
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:26,145
and then we're also letting all of the tax cuts for, both the wealthy-

163
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:30,149
those ab- those who are earning at a family level of 250 thousand

164
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,516
and for the middle-class; we're letting them all expire.

165
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:38,349
And so, we have revenue increase by 400 billion.

166
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:41,514
So this goes up by 400 billion.

167
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:45,000
So plus 400 billion

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,981
and so that takes us roughly- and once again this is all rough-

169
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:52,891
to about 3 trillion in revenue, and 3.5 trillion in expenses

170
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:56,835
and your deficit, under the Fiscal Cliff scenario

171
00:10:56,835 --> 00:11:01,464
the deficit is going to going to be 500 billion dollars

172
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,913
Now you might say, Hey, this is great!

173
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,019
When everyone talks about the deficit, deficit is a scary thing

174
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,867
we're borrowing from the future, and all that

175
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,734
Why are people so afraid of the Fiscal Cliff?

176
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:16,612
The reality is, is that if you take 500 billion out of the economy

177
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:19,770
so 100 billion through spending cuts

178
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,265
and then 100- and then 400 billion from tax increases

179
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,347
so the government is deleveraging

180
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,860
but that money is being sucked out of the economy

181
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,094
and you could argue that there's kind of a multiplier effect as well

182
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:36,232
that that might endanger what is already a very precarious recovery

183
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:40,200
that the recovery is really just starting to happen

184
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,844
and if we were to suck all of the money out of the economy-

185
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:45,461
that's what the argument would be-

186
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:48,171
then that might throw us into another resession

187
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:51,100
or that might make the recovery that much weaker

188
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,547
in the next few videos, we'll discuss that in a little more depth

189
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,619
see what people are saying the impact might be

190
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:01,619
and what the argument might be in either case.
