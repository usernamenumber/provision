1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,860
Let's see if we can apply some
of our new tools to solve

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,880
some line integrals.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,990
So let's say we have a line
integral along a closed curve

5
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,690
-- I'm going to define the path
in a second -- of x squared

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:24,240
plus y squared times
dx plus 2xy times dy.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,230
And then our curve c is
going to be defined by

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,726
the parameterization.

9
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:39,820
x is equal to cosine of t,
and y is equal to sine of t.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,940
And this is valid for
t between 0 and 2 pi.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,110
So this is essentially a
circle, a unit circle,

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,440
in the xy plane, and we
know how to solve these.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,610
Let's see if we can use some of
our discoveries in the last

14
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:59,180
couple of videos to maybe
simplify this process.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,310
So the first thing you might
say, hey, this looks like a

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,850
line integral, but you have a
dx and dy, I don't

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,850
see a dot dr here.

18
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,850
It's not clear to me that
this is some type of even

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,870
a vector line integral.

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,400
I don't see any of vectors.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,370
What I want to do first, and
the reason why I wanted to show

22
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,150
you this example, is just to
show you that this is just

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,980
another form of writing really
a vector line integral.

24
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,160
To show you that you just have
to realize if I have some are

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,900
r of t -- this is our curve.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,476
I don't even write these
functions in there.

27
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:33,660
I'm just going to write
it's x of t times i

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,660
plus y of t times j.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,160
We've seen several videos now
that we can write dr dt as

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:50,910
being equal to dx dt times
i plus dy dt times j.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,960
We've seen this multiple times.

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
And we've seen multiple times
we want to get the differential

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,210
dr, we can just multiply
everything times dt.

34
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,560
And normally I just put a
dt here and a dt there

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,440
and get rid of this dt.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,940
But if you multiply everything
times dt, if you view the

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,740
differentials as actual
numbers, you can multiply and

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,840
normally you can treat
them like that.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,780
Then you just get rid
of all of the dt's.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,020
So dr you could imagine is
equal to dx times the unit

41
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,200
vector i plus dy times
the unit vector j.

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,020
So put that aside, and
you might already

43
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,160
see a pattern here.

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,650
So if we define our vector
field f, f of xy, as being

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:43,500
equal to x squared plus y
squared, i plus 2xy j,

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,720
what is this thing?

47
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,600
What is this thing over here?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,920
Well, what is f dot
dr going to be?

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,090
Dot products, you just multiply
the corresponding components

50
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,710
of our vectors and
then add them up.

51
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,620
So it's going to be if you take
this f and dot it with that dr

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,790
you're going to get the i
component, x squared plus y

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:16,480
squared times that dx plus --
I'll do it in the pink again --

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,150
plus the y component, the j
component 2xy times that dy.

55
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,590
That's the dot product.

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,760
And notice, this thing
right here is identical to

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,270
that thing right there.

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,310
So our line integral, just to
put it in a form that we're

59
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,880
familiar with, this is the same
exact thing as the line

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:48,483
integral over this curve c,
this closed curve c, of this f

61
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:51,820
-- maybe I'll write it in that
magenta color, or actually it's

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,990
more of a purple or pink
color -- f dot this dr.

63
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,050
That's what this line integral
is, it's just a different

64
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,840
way of writing it.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,330
Now that you see it, in the
future if you see in kind of

66
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,850
this differential form, you'll
immediately know OK, there's

67
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,430
one vector field that this is
its x component, this is its y

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,860
component, dotting with the dr.
This is the x component of dr

69
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,810
or the i component, and this is
the y component or the j

70
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,570
component of the dr. So you
immediately know what the

71
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,010
vector field is that we're
taking a line integral of.

72
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,210
This is the x, that's the y.

73
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,850
Now, let's ask
ourselves a question.

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,070
Is f conservative?

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:40,660
So is f equal to the gradient
of some scalar field, we'll

76
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,480
call it capital F --
is this the case?

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,860
So let's assume it is and see
if we can solve for a scalar

78
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,010
field whose grade
it really is f.

79
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,770
Then we know that f
is conservative.

80
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,470
And then if f is conservative,
and this is the whole reason we

81
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,380
want to do it, that means that
any closed loop, any line

82
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,090
integral over a closed curve of
f is going to be equal

83
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,560
to 0 and we'd be done.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,060
So if we can show this then the
answer to this question or this

85
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,480
question is going to be 0.

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,180
We don't even have to mess with
the cosine of t's and the

87
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,440
sign of t's and all that.

88
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,620
Actually, we don't even have
to take antiderivatives.

89
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,380
So let's see if we can find
an f whose gradient is

90
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,740
equal to that right there.

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,120
   

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,200
So in order for f's gradient to
be that, that means that the

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,410
partial derivative of our
capital F with respect to x has

94
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,140
got to be equal to
that right there.

95
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,820
It's got to be equal to x
squared plus y squared.

96
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,410
And it also tells us that the
partial derivative of capital

97
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:52,175
F with respect to y has
got to be equal to 2xy.

98
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:55,310
   

99
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,020
And just as a review, if I have
the gradient of any function,

100
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,215
of any scalar field is equal to
the partial of f with respect

101
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:07,460
to x times i plus the
partial of capital F with

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,850
respect to y times j.

103
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,350
So that's why I'm just
pattern matching.

104
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm just saying well, gee, if
this is the gradient of that,

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,780
then this must be that, which I
wrote down right here, and this

106
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,090
must be that, which
I wrote down here.

107
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,310
So let's see if I can find
an f that satisfies both

108
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,390
of these constraints.

109
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,255
So we could just take the
antiderivative with respect to

110
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:39,230
x on both sides -- remember,
you just treat y like a

111
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,440
constant or y squared like a
constant -- it's just a number.

112
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,220
So then we could say that f is
equal to the antiderivative of

113
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,840
x squared is x to
the third over 3.

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,780
   

115
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,335
And then the antiderivative
of y squared -- remember,

116
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:57,980
this is with respect to x.

117
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,000
So you just treat
it like a number.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,930
That could just be the
number k, or this

119
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,890
could be the number 5.

120
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,820
So this is just going
to be that times x.

121
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,640
So plus x times y squared.

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,500
And then there could be
some function of y here.

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,050
So plus some, I don't know,
I'll call it g of y.

124
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,210
Because there could have been
some function of y here.

125
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,700
If it's a pure function of y,
when you take the derivative or

126
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,270
the partial with respect to x,
this would have disappeared.

127
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,790
So it would reappear when we
take the antiderivative.

128
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:35,150
And just to be clear, let me
make it clear that f is going

129
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,280
to be a function of x and y.

130
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,415
So we just have the, I
guess you could say

131
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:40,830
the antiderivative
with respect to x.

132
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,110
Let's see if we take the
antiderivative with respect

133
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,930
to y and then we can
reconcile the two.

134
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,260
So based on this, f of xy, f of
xy is going to have to look

135
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,280
like -- so let's take the
antiderivative with

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,035
respect to y here.

137
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,540
So remember, you just treat x
like it's just some number --

138
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,210
it could be a k, it could
be an m, it could be a 5.

139
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,610
It's just some number.

140
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,260
So if x is just some
-- the antiderivative

141
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,960
of 2y is y squared.

142
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,230
And if x is just a number
there, the antiderivative of

143
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,820
this with respect to y is
just going to be xy squared.

144
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,590
Don't believe me?

145
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,720
Take the partial of this
with respect to y.

146
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,590
Treat x like a constant
you'll get 2 times xy

147
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,150
with no exponent there.

148
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,660
And, of course, if you took the
antiderivative with respect to

149
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,580
x, there might be some
function of x here.

150
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,130
We were just basing it
off of that information.

151
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,850
Now given that, this
information says f of xy

152
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,480
is going to have to look
something like this.

153
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,940
This information tells us f
of xy's going to have to

154
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,320
look something like that.

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,430
Let's see if there is an
f of xy that looks like

156
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,470
both of them essentially.

157
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,780
So let's see.

158
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,740
On this one we have xy
squared here, we have

159
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,990
an xy squared there.

160
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,940
So good.

161
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,110
That looks good.

162
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,770
And it over here we have an f
of x -- we have something

163
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,450
that's a pure function of x.

164
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,550
And here we have something
that is a pure function of x.

165
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,990
So these two things could
be the same thing.

166
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,170
Then here we have a pure
function of y that might be

167
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,630
there, but it didn't really
show up anywhere over here.

168
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,610
So we could just say hey,
that's going to be 0.

169
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,460
0 is a pure function of y.

170
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,870
You could have something
called g of y is equal to 0.

171
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:24,230
And then we get that capital F
of xy is equal to x to the

172
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:30,020
third over 3 plus xy squared.

173
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,980
And the gradient of this is
going to be equal to f.

174
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,230
And we've already
established that.

175
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,810
But just to hit the point home,
let's take the gradient of it.

176
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,540
Just if you don't believe this
little stuff that I did right

177
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,790
there, let's take the gradient.

178
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,280
The gradient of f is equal to,
and sometimes people put a

179
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,450
little vector there
because you're getting

180
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,460
a vector out of it.

181
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,290
You could put a little vector
on top of that gradient sign.

182
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,760
The gradient of f is
going to be what?

183
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,625
The partial of this with
respect to x times i.

184
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,320
So the partial of this
with respect to x.

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,500
The derivative here is
3 divided by 3 is 1.

186
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,590
So it's just x squared plus the
derivative of this with respect

187
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:15,370
to x is y squared times i plus
the partial with respect to y.

188
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,986
Well, the partial with respect
to y of this 0, partial with

189
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:22,340
respect to y of this is
2xy or 2xy to the first.

190
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,890
So it's 2xy times j.

191
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,180
And this is exactly equal to f,
our f that we wrote up there.

192
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,470
So we've established that f can
definitely be written -- f is

193
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,790
definitely the gradient of some
potential scalar

194
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,750
function there.

195
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:49,390
So f is conservative, and that
tells us that this closed loop

196
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,530
integral, line integral, of f
is going to be equal to 0.

197
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,220
And we are done.

198
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,890
We could even ignore the actual
parameterization of the path.

199
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:01,466
