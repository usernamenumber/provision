1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,982
Before we go into the details of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it's important to understand the world's environment

2
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:10,249
entering into October of 1962.

3
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:15,802
In 1959, you have a revolution in Cuba led by Fidel Castro.

4
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:18,853
And he is heading the Communist party there.

5
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,053
Cuba is now a Communist nation right off of the coast of the United States.

6
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:29,546
This is the middle of the Cold War. The U.S. believes in a strategy of containment, does not like this.

7
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:38,049
So in 1961, the United States, the CIA, the Kennedy Administration, they try using Cuban exiles,

8
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,867
people who have left Cuba,

9
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:43,867
they try to support them to enter and invade Cuba

10
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:49,722
at the Bay of Pigs. But, the whole effort wasn't planned properly.

11
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:52,968
The support for the Cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those [who] were

12
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:56,831
trying to oust Castro, it was kind of this

13
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:59,445
half-hearted effort. And it was this big failure.

14
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:05,533
So the Bay of Bigs invasion was a failure in 1961.

15
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:10,267
And it made John F. Kennedy seem a little bit weak. It made the CIA seem [weak]. It didn't make

16
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:14,133
anyone on the American side look all that competent, because of that failure.

17
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:16,733
On top of that, we're in the middle of the Cold War, remember this.

18
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:26,600
And at the same time, if you go to what the US was doing around the Soviet Union, it started placing missiles,

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,330
starting [in] the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 ---

20
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,467
it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in Turkey and in Italy.

21
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,406
These are where they were allocated.

22
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:42,888
And the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population

23
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:47,733
centers of the Soviet Union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, I think.

24
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,333
16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne.

25
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:56,200
And in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,333
well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate,

27
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,400
and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,067
So there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible [to your enemies]

29
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:11,239
so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent,

30
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,357
as quickly as possible.

31
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:16,069
And if you look up on the Web, you can actually find the actual missile sites,

32
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,267
and where they were installed, and when they became operational.

33
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:24,405
These are the ones that were in Italy, kind of right here, near the heel of Italy.

34
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,200
So you have this environment, the United States was looking a little bit weak

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,069
after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

36
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,133
It looks like they wanted to oust Castro, but they weren't able to do it.

37
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,667
They weren't able because they were slightly inept.

38
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,564
And at the same time you could imagine that the Soviet Union did not appreciate the United States

39
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:46,487
placing these missiles so close to its population centers.

40
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:49,273
Missiles that could reach its population centers very easily.

41
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:57,467
So now, we fast forward to October of 1962 and the entire Cuban Missile Crisis will occur

42
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:05,400
over 13 or 14 days during October of 1962.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:14,200
So, on the 14th of October we're sending these U2 spy planes over Cuba.

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,038
So this right here is a U2 spy plane. That is a U2 spy plane.

45
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,877
And it takes pictures that look like this. And on the next day, on October 15th, you have the CIA analysts.

46
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:23,221
And they're saying, "Wow - that looks like missiles over there.

47
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:28,817
This looks like ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in Cuba".

48
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:34,800
And so all of a sudden, it looks like the Soviet Union is using Cuba to do the same thing that

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,400
we used Turkey and Italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast --

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,320
strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the United States.

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,508
So by the 16th-- So this is literally two days after the pictures were taken.

53
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:57,053
The next day, they're analyzing them, [and] they tell the State Department about them.

54
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:01,905
[On] the 16th, they tell Kennedy about them, and Kennedy holds a meeting

55
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:06,224
of the Executive Committee. It wasn't called "ExComm," just [yet].

56
00:04:06,224 --> 00:04:09,733
But it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the National Security Council

57
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:14,333
and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out

58
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:19,646
what to do about this forming crisis. Because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't

59
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:23,867
like off of our borders -- a Communist state -- a state aligned with the Soviet Union.

60
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:28,562
All of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks like these are offensive weapons.

61
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:31,667
These are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability.

62
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:35,156
Once again, if they're being launched from Cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate

63
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:40,333
the US before the US even has an opportunity to respond properly.

64
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,133
So this really freaks out the Kennedy Administration.

65
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,867
And so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on--

66
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:48,933
Well, there's a couple--

67
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,155
You could just kind of call and talk to the Soviets about it

68
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:54,533
and say: "Hey, we don't like that. Why don't you undo your missiles?"

69
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:58,067
But they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the Soviets.

70
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:01,867
Especially, because they probably thought that Kennedy was weak at this point.

71
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:06,067
And just to understand who was leading the Soviets at this time,

72
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:10,067
it was Khrushchev. (This is Khrushchev right over here.)

73
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:13,667
And he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that Kennedy was young

74
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:20,355
and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here.

75
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:25,892
And so the US kind of felt that it had to look strong here. And so the only real

76
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:32,000
options on the table were: maybe blockade Cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade,

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,482
so it would be an economic blockade. But then that's actually considered an act of war

78
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:41,217
because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. Another option for the United States,

79
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:45,467
(because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here,

80
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:49,901
and that they should be deployable from Cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks

81
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:55,400
on these missile silos. And then the most extreme

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,885
action would be to actually invade Cuba. And ,obviously that goes in line

83
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:05,552
with, the US' general interest of not having a communist regime

84
00:06:05,552 --> 00:06:07,457
so close to its own borders.

85
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:11,021
So, this is what Kennedy and his team was wrestling with.

86
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:17,318
And really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising Kennedy

87
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:20,320
that they should do a full-scale invasion of Cuba.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,804
They thought that this was the only thing that the Soviets would take seriously,

89
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:25,702
it would show that the US is serious about this.

90
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:30,072
And they didn't think that the Soviet Union would really try to put up a fight

91
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,267
in Cuba, so far away from their own borders.

92
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,933
But Kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably,

93
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,338
realized "Well, hey. They might not do anything in Cuba,

94
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:42,733
and they might allow us to oust Castro and install a new regime there.

95
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:48,200
But they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in Europe, but specifically, in Berlin,

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,010
probably in Germany as a whole. So, just for the sake of getting these things out of Cuba,

97
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,579
we could sacrifice a lot in Europe. And even more, that any type of conflict

98
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,554
between the US and the Soviet Union could easily escalate to a nuclear war".

99
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:07,400
So these were all on the table. The US goes on high alert.

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,148
It prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen.

101
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:18,741
The Army, the Air Force and the Navy [start] mobilizing. So, on, kind of with hours notice,

102
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:23,153
any of those options can, kind of, go into effect.

103
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:27,600
By the 22nd, you have the Executive Committee -- (And that just becomes formalized

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,905
as an actual, official group that is advising the President in this capacity.) --

105
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:40,467
and on the 22nd, Kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the US' position

106
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,891
on what's going on here.

107
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:46,535
And before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet,

108
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:50,600
he did meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs,

109
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,292
Andrei Gromyko --

110
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:54,639
and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciations --

111
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,238
and this is where the first time, Kennedy is like "Hey, you've got these offensive weapons..."

112
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:00,933
And Gromyko is insisting that "No, they're just defensive weapons".

113
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:04,867
And, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things like surface-to-air missiles,

114
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,803
things that would stop planes from bombings. But not surface-to-surface missiles,

115
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:10,333
not something that could attack a country.

116
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:14,608
But we'll see, in future letters from Khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive

117
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:19,195
these missiles as somehow being defensive. But you fast forward.

118
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:23,800
That was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made Kennedy and the US frustrated with the

119
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,938
Russians, because it felt like the Americans are saying,

120
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:29,887
"Look, we clearly know you have missiles there", but Gromyko is saying "No, these are just

121
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,933
defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. Why are you taking this so seriously?"

122
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:35,067
The 19th: US goes on high alert.

123
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,737
It starts thinking about all of these options.

124
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:42,472
The 22nd: this Committee is formed formally. But more importantly,

125
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:46,933
Kennedy gives a speech to state the United States' opinion.

126
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,400
And I'll just read it right here:

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,152
"To halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment

128
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:59,562
under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba

129
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:06,267
from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons,

130
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:11,219
be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers.

131
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,562
We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life,

132
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:19,000
as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948."

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,533
So, the Kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced.

134
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:29,067
They said "We can't do an all out blockade. 1) That is an act of war;

135
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:33,904
2) That is, to a large degree, inhumane. Why should we starve the Cuban people?

136
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:40,000
What we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into Cuba.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,655
We will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments,

138
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,138
and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it."

139
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:53,000
But then on the 24th, there is a cable from Khrushchev, and it say,:

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,667
"If you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions,

141
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,815
you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary

142
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:05,867
demands of the United States -- and that the Soviet Union views the blockade

143
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:09,933
as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it."

144
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,448
So the game of chicken is beginning to emerge.

145
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,468
The United States if just saying "Look, this is unacceptable.

146
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,767
We're gonna stop you from shipping arms to Cuba."

147
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:21,533
On the 24th, Khrushchev is saying "Who are you to tell us what to do?"

148
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:25,005
and, you know, there's this kind of under current like, "Wait, you've already got stuff set up

149
00:10:25,005 --> 00:10:30,667
in Italy and Turkey, not too far from us. How can you dare..." -- (you know, and they call it

150
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,133
a blockade, even though the US is calling it a quarantine) --

151
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,867
"this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it."

152
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,133
So both parties are kind of saying,

153
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:40,360
"We don't care what you're gonna do. We're gonna do what whatever we have to do"

154
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,772
And this whole time, both sides are getting tense,

155
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:49,067
the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong.

156
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:55,400
So, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,869
the Soviet Union and the United States.

158
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,733
And you know, you can read the book "13 Days - Robert Kennedy",

159
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,698
there's also the movie "13 Days," which actually is not based on the book.

160
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:07,783
But both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period.

161
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:11,200
But then you fast forward to the 25th and Kennedy essentially replies,

162
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,867
"Look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses I have announced.

163
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,467
I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier

164
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:25,267
situation." Ok, so he's saying - "Look, we have to do this. These are offensive weapons.

165
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,867
We cannot tolerate these weapons so close to US borders.

166
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,133
And so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect.

167
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:33,600
It does get challenged.

168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,690
The US does start to inspect some ships. They try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit.

169
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,267
So the Soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken,

170
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:49,439
they are turning back. They did turn back 14 ships. And the best guess is that those 14 ships

171
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,800
probably did contain some type of armament.

172
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,267
So even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game,

173
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:59,667
behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance.

174
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:06,947
And then you fast forward to the 26th, and Khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal.

175
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:12,533
And it's interesting here. Because, in Khrushchev's mind -- (And this is a fascinating letter to read.

176
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:16,351
It's a fairly long letter, so I'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this URL right

177
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:19,400
over here. It's a fascinating letter. Maybe I'll do a whole video where I just read this letter.)

178
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,200
He kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon.

179
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,733
He implicitly admits that the missiles are there --

180
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,282
That they're not these benign weapons.

181
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:35,333
But, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons.

182
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:39,733
He says: "Look, you guys attempted to oust Castro already.

183
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:44,754
We view Castro as an ally. We think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less

184
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:48,800
likely to be able to oust Castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons."

185
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,455
So, Khrushchev is kind of setting up-- Kruschev is saying, "We don't have the intention of using these to attack

186
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:59,401
you for no reason. We're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies."

187
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,701
So he's saying that's the reason.

188
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,800
That's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place.

189
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,667
He's kind of saying "Look, you did Bay of Pigs. You were the ones that took the first shot.

190
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,267
Now we are defending it."

191
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,533
That might have been the rationale.

192
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:15,133
Another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale --

193
00:13:15,133 --> 00:13:20,087
is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the Soviet Union in

194
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:23,800
Turkey and Italy. And the Soviet Union just wanted to have parity.

195
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,133
So, they wanted to put missiles near the US [in] some ally's country, from the Soviet Union's

196
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:29,935
point of view.

197
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:35,113
So, on the 26th, Khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says:

198
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:38,400
"If assurances were given by the President and the Government of the United States

199
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,870
that the USA itself would not participate..." - so 'assurances'...

200
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,118
(Let me underline this in a different color.) --

201
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:53,527
"assurances that the USA itself would not participate in an attack on Cuba, and would restrain others

202
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:57,400
from actions of this sort" -- probably the Cuban exiles --

203
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,600
"... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything.

204
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,267
I am not speaking for Fidel Castro, but I think that he and the government

205
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,807
of Cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people

206
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,733
to get down to peaceful labor. Then, too, the question of--"

207
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,403
(And, you know, the Communists always like talking about "labor.") --

208
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:18,372
"then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat,

209
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:20,467
then armaments are a burden for every people."

210
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,527
So in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying:

211
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:28,542
"Look, if you guys just promise not to attack Cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that

212
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:31,333
you will not attack Cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything.

213
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,601
We'll give in to your wishes."

214
00:14:35,601 --> 00:14:38,667
And this stance right here really does make it look like

215
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:42,707
their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect Cuba --

216
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:47,067
so that the US would not try to oust the Communists from there.

217
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:52,800
But then on the next day, Khrushchev has a public broadcast

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,133
where he kind of changes his tone a little bit.

219
00:14:55,133 --> 00:15:01,533
Now he's saying that they would undo the situation in Cuba only if the United States removed

220
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,733
their missiles from Italy and Turkey.

221
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:05,369
So, he's sending little mixed messages.

222
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,622
His first message was kind of a softer stance:

223
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:11,400
"Look, you guys just promise not to invade Cuba and we're gonna pull out of Cuba."

224
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,958
The second stance is saying: "No, no. We're only gonna take our missiles out of Cuba

225
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:19,800
if you take your missiles out of Italy and Turkey."

226
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,733
And on the same day, another U2 spy plane gets shot down over Cuba.

227
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:30,029
This is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice,

228
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:35,133
it's a really scary situation. And this was actually done by-- It was a local decision by a Soviet commander.

229
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,333
(And Khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.)

230
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:43,800
And lucky for, I guess, the world, the US did not use this, alone, as

231
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,400
a reason to engage in war. They said: "Maybe it's an accident. If this happens again,

232
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,626
then we'll use it as [a pretext for] war."

233
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:54,340
So it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the Soviets.

234
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,333
But the Kennedy Administration still had the question: "Which of these was a more serious,

235
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:03,800
you know, which of these requests were the Soviets really making?

236
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,533
This is a more significant request.

237
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,622
Are they requesting for both?

238
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:10,362
And so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that:

239
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:15,215
"Hey, let's just pretend like we didn't even know -- that the Americans didn't even know about

240
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:19,067
the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request."

241
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:22,467
So, you essentially have Kennedy agreeing [with] Khrushchev, and saying:

242
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:30,133
"Ok, we'll do your first request. We will agree not to invade Cuba if you remove your missiles."

243
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:34,371
And then, essentially, what happens--.
And that puts Khrushchev in a weird situation.

244
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:38,400
(Because this is something that he did recommend. But they were ignoring this over here.)

245
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,800
But through back channels we said "Well, we'll offically agree to this."

246
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,067
But through back channels the Kennedy administration said: "And we would

247
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:47,133
also be on an understanding,

248
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:51,467
we will also have an understanding on the missiles in Italy and Turkey."

249
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:56,616
That, "Look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably,

250
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,933
we're probably going to remove them."

251
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:03,200
And what the Soviets also didn't know at that time is that the Americans were planning on --

252
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,135
that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete.

253
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:10,400
Because we already Polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines.

254
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,635
And clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track.

255
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,887
You can't surveil them and all the rest.

256
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:20,133
So the US kind of agreed to it. But they did it secretly.

257
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:23,800
And the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look like they're giving in.

258
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Neither side wanted to look weak.

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,766
But on the 28th, there was finally an agreement. And so, publicly,

260
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:35,667
the first Khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both Khrushchev and the United States.

261
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,900
Khrushchev agreed to remove --

262
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,475
to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there,

263
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:46,993
and the Americans agreed that they would not invade Cuba.

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,232
So you can imagine the big winner here.

265
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:52,901
The big winner here is probably Fidel Castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that

266
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:56,733
the US is planning another attack on him. And, at least publicly now, they're saying

267
00:17:56,733 --> 00:18:00,533
that they cannot invade him. And if they did, it would like they're going back on their word.

268
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:02,892
And privately,

269
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:06,555
the US agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey and Italy.

270
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:09,550
They didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would like they were being weak.

271
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,118
Then it would like the Soviets were able to do this

272
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:17,747
aggressive action. And by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the United States.

273
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,036
Which is actually the reality. They were able to --

274
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:25,154
By doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from Turkey and Italy.

275
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,000
But the United States wanted to look strong.

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,333
Kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. Especially after the Bay of Pigs,

277
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,583
he needed to look like a strong leader.

278
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:38,133
And so, to some degree, you have to give Khrushchev credit for this. He kind of swallowed

279
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:42,569
his pride and allowed it to publicly look like he lost the negotiation.

280
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:46,330
He publicly made it look like he got nothing in return for backing down,

281
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,933
but in reality he did. He just didn't necessarily get credit for it.

282
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:57,000
But this was a big deal. Because this was the closest that the Soviet Union and the US ever got to

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,975
really the brink during the Cold War.
