1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,550
Let's say I have some
transformation from R2 to R2.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,280
And it's essentially just a
multiplication times a matrix.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,220
And we know that all linear
transformations can be

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,260
expressed as a multiplication
of a matrix, but this one is

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:25,940
equal to the matrix 1, 3, 2, 6
times whatever vector you give

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,170
me in my domain.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,590
Times x1, x2.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,030
Now let's say I have some
subset in my codomain.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,550
So let me draw this
right here.

11
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,350
So my domain looks like that.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,310
It's R2.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,840
And of course my function or
my transformation maps

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,340
elements of R2 into elements
of its codomain which also

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,100
happens to be R2.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,310
I could show it mapping into
itself, but for the sake of

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,150
simplicity let's draw
my codomain here.

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,590
And our transformation of course
maps, for any element

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,215
here, the transformation of that
will be an association or

20
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:03,560
a mapping into R2.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,970
Now what if we take some subset
of R2, and let's just

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,650
say it's a set of two vectors,
the zero vector in R2, and the

23
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,800
vector 1, 2.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,840
So it's literally, let's
say it's this point.

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,070
Let me do it in a
different color.

26
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,110
Let's say this is my
zero vector in R2.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm not plotting them.

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,350
I'm just showing that they're
in this, they're in R2.

29
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,430
That's my zero vector,
and let's say the

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,170
vector 1,2 is here.

31
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,370
1,2.

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,050
What I want to know is, what are
all of the vectors in my

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,570
domain whose transformations
map to this subset?

34
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,670
Map to this point?

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,780
So I want to know, I'm
essentially, I want to know

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,840
the preimage of S.

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,730
So the preimage of S, let
me be careful, the

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:04,450
preimage of S under T.

39
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,160
And I said be careful because
when you say preimage of

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,360
something without saying under
something else, it implies

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,930
that you're taking.

42
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,580
Well when you say image of
something, it implies you're

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,520
taking the image of an entire
transformation like I showed

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,370
you, I think, two videos ago.

45
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,720
But when you're taking the image
or preimage of a set,

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,270
you make sure you say under
what transformation.

47
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,630
So we want to know the preimage
of this subset of our

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,940
codomain under the
transformation T.

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,650
Let me write this as
T inverse of S.

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,680
And we saw in the last video
this is all of the x, all of

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:46,240
the elements in our domain where
the transformation of

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,890
those x's is a member of the
subset of our codomain that

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,760
we're trying to find
the preimage of.

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,330
Right?

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,850
Now what is another way
of writing this?

56
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,170
Well this is, you can write this
as, we're trying to look

57
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:06,050
for all of the x's in our domain
such that this, let's

58
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,930
call this A, that matrix A.

59
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,600
Such that A times x
is a member of S.

60
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,300
So that means A times x has to
be equal to this or has to be

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,060
equal to that.

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,810
So that means A times our vector
x has to be equal to

63
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,030
the zero vector.

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,660
Or A times our vector x has to
be equal to this vector 1,2.

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,240
This is the exact same
statement as

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,020
this one right here.

67
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,690
I just made it a little bit more
explicit in terms of our

68
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,210
actual transformation,
A times x.

69
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,710
And in terms of what
our actual set is.

70
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,170
Our set is just two vectors.

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,920
So if we want to determine
the preimage of S.

72
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,050
So we write that the preimage
of S under T.

73
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,080
That set there.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,460
We essentially have to just
find all of the x's that

75
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,780
satisfy these two equations
right there.

76
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,080
So this equation, so we have
to find all of the x's that

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,280
satisfy, the first one right
here is the matrix 1, 3, 2, 6

78
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,589
times x1, x2 is equal
to the zero vector.

79
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,380
That's this equation
right there.

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,240
We need to find all of the
solutions to that.

81
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,790
And you might already
recognize it.

82
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,540
All of the solutions to this,
all of the x's that satisfy

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,750
this, is the null space
of this matrix.

84
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,210
I just thought I'd point
that out on the side.

85
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,530
Now, that's not the only one.

86
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,270
We also have to solve
this guy over here.

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,690
I'll do that in blue.

88
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,080
So the preimage of S under
T is going to be all the

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,280
solutions to this plus all of
the solutions to 1, 3, 2, 6

90
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,300
times x1, x2 is equal to 1, 2.

91
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,280
Now we can just solve this
with an augmented matrix.

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,230
So my augmented matrix would
look like 1, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0.

93
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,160
And here my augmented matrix
would be 1, 3, 2, 6, 1, 2.

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,960
Let's put this in reduced
row echelon form.

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,580
So let's replace our second row
with our second row minus

96
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,880
2 times the first row.

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,450
So what do we get?

98
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,930
Our first row stays the same.

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,960
1, 3, 0.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,110
Let me do them simultaneously.

101
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,590
Let me solve these systems
in parallel.

102
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,880
So my first system stays, first
row stays the same.

103
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,710
1, 3, 1.

104
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,490
And in both cases, because I
just want to get the left hand

105
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,660
side of my augmented matrix into
reduced row echelon form,

106
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,840
I can apply the same
row operation.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
So I'm replacing my second row
with 2 times my first row.

108
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,040
So 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,400
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,650
And of course 0 minus
2 times 0 is 0.

111
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,860
Here 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

112
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,420
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

113
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,950
And 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

114
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,080
So we get all these zeroes,
and we're actually done.

115
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,100
We have both of these augmented
matrices in reduced

116
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,420
row echelon form.

117
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,330
And how do we go back to solve
all of the x1's and x2's that

118
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,100
satisfy these?

119
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,250
Well you recognize that our
first columns right here are

120
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,080
pivot columns.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,340
And these are associated with
our variable x1, so we know

122
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,330
that x1 is a pivot variable.

123
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,380
And we know that the second
column is a non pivot column.

124
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,180
Because it has no 1's in it.

125
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,880
And so it's associated
with x2.

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,380
And since x2 isn't a pivot
column, we know that x2 is a

127
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,630
free variable.

128
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,980
   

129
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,110
Which essentially means we can
set x2 to be anything.

130
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,700
So let's just set x2.

131
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,570
x2 is equal to t, where t is
a member of the reals.

132
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,300
In this case what is x1
going to be equal to?

133
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,580
So here this top equation
says, let me write it.

134
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,370
If we just kind of go back to
this world right here, this

135
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:12,570
means that x1 plus 3x2 is
equal to this 0 here.

136
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:20,000
This top line right here says
x1 plus 3x2 is equal to 1.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,970
And so if we say x2 is equal to
t, this equation becomes x1

138
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,650
plus 3t is equal to 0.

139
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,510
Subtract 3t from both
sides, you get x1 is

140
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,660
equal to minus 3t.

141
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,670
And then this equation, you
get x1 is equal to, if we

142
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:47,400
substitute x2 with t, is x1
is equal to 1 minus 3t.

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,590
Now if we wanted to write the
solution sets in kind of

144
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,540
vector notation.

145
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,420
The solution set for this guy
right here, for this first

146
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:03,530
equation right there, is going
to be x1, x2 is equal to what?

147
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:12,540
It's going to be equal to, you
have your, well, x2 is just

148
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,320
going to be equal to t times.

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,670
It's just going to
be equal to t.

150
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,920
So let me just write it there.

151
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,070
   

152
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,620
x2 is just t times 1.

153
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,470
It's just equal to t.

154
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,780
I made that definition
up here.

155
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,340
And then what's x1 equal to?

156
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,390
It's equal to minus 3 times t.

157
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,550
If I put a t out here as
a scalar, it's just

158
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,409
minus 3 times t.

159
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,500
So this is a solution for
this first equation.

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,280
Some, where t is a member of the
reals, So it's just scalar

161
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,100
multiples of the vector
minus 3, 1.

162
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
And if we think of this position
vector, this'll be a

163
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,180
line in R2.

164
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,590
And I'll draw that
in a second.

165
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,830
So that's a solution for
this first equation.

166
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,900
And then the solution for the
second equation, how can we

167
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,740
set this up?

168
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,630
It's going to be, make sure you
can see it, It is x1, x2,

169
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,560
and let's see.

170
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,670
x2 once again is
just t times 1.

171
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,770
Let me just write
it like this.

172
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,310
So it's t times 1.

173
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,920
That's x2.

174
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,320
Now what's x1?

175
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
x1 is equal to 1 minus
3 times t.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,450
So if we do a minus 3 that give
us our minus 3 times t.

177
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,740
But we need to do
1 minus that.

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,490
Or 1 plus minus 3 times t.

179
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,660
So what we can do is, we could
say that all the solution set

180
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:40,290
here is equal to the vector 1,
here, so now we have 1 plus

181
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,700
minus 3 times t for x1.

182
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,330
And here we could say is 0.

183
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,030
x2 is equal 0 plus t.

184
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,470
Or x2 is equal to t.

185
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,510
So this is the solution set
for the second equation.

186
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,530
So our preimage of S.

187
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,940
Remember S was just these two
points in our codomain.

188
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,560
The preimage of S under T is
essentially all of the x's

189
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,720
that satisfy these
two equations.

190
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,830
And let's actually
graphs those.

191
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,190
Let me turn on my graphs.

192
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,670
That makes it look a little
bit messy, but let me

193
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,340
graph it down here.

194
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,635
Let me copy and paste
my two results.

195
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,810
   

196
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,750
Then I want to paste it.

197
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,070
So those are my two results.

198
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,250
Put my pen back on.

199
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,530
And now what I can do is I
can graph it right here.

200
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,040
So let's see.

201
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,360
The solution set for that first
equation is all the

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,390
multiples of the vector
minus 3, 1.

203
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,390
So the vector minus 3,
1 looks like this.

204
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,940
   

205
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,800
Looks like that.

206
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,610
That's the vector minus 3, 1.

207
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,280
But my solution set
is all the scalar

208
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,770
multiples of minus 3, 1.

209
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,400
This is a comma right here.

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,690
Right?

211
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,330
So if I just take all the scalar
multiples of minus 3,

212
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,240
1, it's going to
look like this.

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,010
So if you take 2 times
it, you're going to

214
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,670
have minus 6, 2.

215
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,840
So you're going to
get like that.

216
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,090
So it's going to be all of
these points right here.

217
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,000
I wish I could draw a little
bit neater, but I think you

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,735
get the idea.

219
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:21,410
It's going to be a
line like that.

220
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,650
That is that solution
set right there.

221
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,130
And then what is this solution
set right here?

222
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,230
It's the vector 1, 0.

223
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,750
So we go out 1 and 0,
so that's there.

224
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,590
Plus scalar multiples
of minus 3, 1.

225
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,310
So plus scalar multiples
of this.

226
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,900
So if we just had 1 scalar
multiple of minus 3, 1 we'll

227
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,880
end up right there.

228
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,740
But we want to put all the
scalar multiples of it,

229
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,330
because we have this
t right here.

230
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,620
So we're going to end up with
another line with the same

231
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,460
slope essentially, that's just
shifted a little bit.

232
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,825
It's shifted 1 to the right.

233
00:11:57,825 --> 00:12:01,350
   

234
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,130
Now what why did we
do all of this?

235
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,670
Remember what we wanted to find
out is, what were all of

236
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:16,190
the vectors, let me turn off the
graph paper, in our domain

237
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,170
that when we apply the
transformation, map to vectors

238
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,060
within our subset
of our codomain.

239
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,720
Map to either 0, 0 or
the vector 1, 2.

240
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,320
And we've figured all of those
vectors out by solving these

241
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,230
two equations.

242
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,630
And we are able to see that
these two lines, so when I

243
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,710
turn my graph paper on, they
map to the points.

244
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,430
So when these guys, when you
apply the transformation, I'll

245
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,530
draw it all on the same graph.

246
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,760
They map, when you apply the
transformation, to the point

247
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,520
0, 0 and to the point 1, 2.

248
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,350
Which was right here.

249
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,760
So all of these points, when you
apply the transformation,

250
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,050
and actually all the ones in
the blue, they map to 0, 0.

251
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,630
Because we solved this
top equation.

252
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,080
And all the ones in orange,
when you apply the

253
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,680
transformation, map
to the point 1, 2.

254
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,170
   

255
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,370
Now this blue line right here.

256
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,370
This has a special
name for it.

257
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,050
And I actually touched on is it
a little bit before, right?

258
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,420
Everything in this
blue line, right?

259
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,113
If I call this set right here,
I don't know, let's

260
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,140
call it B for blue.

261
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,570
This is the blue line.

262
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,940
That's this set of vectors
right here.

263
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,560
Everything there, when I apply
my transformation of those

264
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,990
blue vectors, or if I take the
image of my blue set under T,

265
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,410
it all maps to the
zero vector.

266
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,950
   

267
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,150
It equals the set of the zero
vector right there.

268
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,050
We saw that right there.

269
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,730
And I remember when, well
earlier in the video I pointed

270
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,110
out that, look , this
set right here.

271
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,750
This is equivalent to the
null space, right?

272
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,100
The null space of a matrix is
all the vectors that if you

273
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,990
multiply it by that
matrix, you get 0.

274
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,340
So this is a similar
idea here.

275
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,890
This transformation is
defined by a matrix.

276
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,040
And we're saying, what are all
of the x's that when you

277
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,750
transform them you get
the zero vector?

278
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,810
And so this idea, this blue
thing right here, it's called

279
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:30,570
the kernel of T.

280
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,880
Sometimes it's written just
shorthand K-E-R of T.

281
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,450
And this literally is all of the
vectors that if you apply

282
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,630
the transformation, let
me write it this way.

283
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,850
It's all of the vectors in our
domain, which was R2, such

284
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:52,940
that the transformation of those
vectors is equal to the

285
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,620
zero vector.

286
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,540
There this is the definition
of the kernel.

287
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:03,580
And if the transformation is
equal to some matrix times

288
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,670
some vector, and we know that
any linear transformation can

289
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:12,460
be written as a matrix vector
product, then the kernel of T

290
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,790
is the same thing as the
null space of A.

291
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,600
And we saw that earlier
in the video.

292
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,150
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.

293
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,201
