1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,360
A couple of videos ago, I made
the statement that the rank of

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,280
a matrix A is equal to the
rank of its transpose.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,910
And I made a bit of a
hand wavy argument.

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,310
It was at the end of the
video, and I was tired.

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,710
It was actually the
end of the day.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,810
And I thought it'd be worthwhile
to maybe flush this

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,300
out a little bit.

9
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,620
Because it's an important
take away.

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,550
It'll help us understand
everything we've learned a

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,200
little bit better.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,560
So, let's understand-- I'm
actually going to start with

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,830
the rank of A transpose.

14
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,630
   

15
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,080
The rank of A transpose is equal
to the dimension of the

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,020
column space of A transpose.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,690
That's the definition
of the rank.

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,810
The dimension of the column
space of A transpose is the

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,950
number of basis vectors for the

20
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,330
column space of A transpose.

21
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,810
That's what dimension is.

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,900
For any subspace, you figure out
how many basis vectors you

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,910
need in that subspace,
and you count them,

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,830
and that's your dimension.

25
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,180
So, it's the number of basis
vectors for the column space

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,150
of A transpose, which is, of
course, the same thing.

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,530
This thing we've seen multiple
times, is the same thing as

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,780
the row space of A.

29
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,690
   

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:17,950
Right?

31
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,220
The columns of A transpose
are the same thing

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,785
as the rows of A.

33
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:24,310
It's because You switch the
rows and the columns.

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,480
Now, how can we figure out the
number of basis vectors we

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,390
need for the column space
of A transpose, or the

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,040
row space of A?

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,160
Let's just think about what
the column space of A

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,330
transpose is telling us.

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,290
So, it's equivalent to--
so let's say, let

40
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,690
me draw A like this.

41
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,400
   

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,420
That's a matrix A.

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,160
Let's say it's an
m by n matrix.

44
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,210
Let me just write it as a
bunch of row vectors.

45
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,040
I could also write it as a bunch
of column vectors, but

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,150
right now let's stick
to the row vectors.

47
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,420
So we have row one.

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
The transpose of
column vectors.

49
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,460
That's row one, and we're going
to have row two, and

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,710
we're going to go all the
way down to row m.

51
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,010
Right?

52
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,970
It's an m by n matrix.

53
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,289
Each of these vectors are
members of rn, because they're

54
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,690
going to have n entries in them

55
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,800
because we have n columns.

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,730
So, that's what A is
going to look like.

57
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,050
A is going look like that.

58
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,660
And then A transpose, all
of these rows are

59
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,480
going to become columns.

60
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,670
A transpose is going to look
like this. r1, r2,

61
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,890
all the way to rm.

62
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,880
And this is of course going
to be an n by m matrix.

63
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,485
You swap these out.

64
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:38,670
So, all these rows are
going to be columns.

65
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,650
Right?

66
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,590
And, obviously the column
space-- or maybe not so

67
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,350
obviously-- the column space of
A transpose is equal to the

68
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:56,270
span of r1, r2, all
the way to rm.

69
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:56,900
Right?

70
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,390
It's equal to the span
of these things.

71
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,780
Or you could equivocally call
it, it's equal to the span of

72
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,470
the rows of A.

73
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,740
That's why it's also called
the row space.

74
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:12,560
This is equal to the span
of the rows of A.

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,530
These two things
are equivalent.

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,100
Now, these are the span.

77
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,260
That means this is some subspace
that's all of the

78
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,700
linear combinations of these
columns, or all of the linear

79
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,090
combinations of these rows.

80
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,030
If we want the basis for it, we
want to find a minimum set

81
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,280
of linearly independent vectors
that we could use to

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
construct any of
these columns.

83
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,830
Or that we could use construct
any of these rows, right here.

84
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,270
Now, what happens when
we put A into

85
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,070
reduced row echelon form?

86
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:46,290
We do a bunch of row operations
to put it into

87
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,020
reduced row echelon form.

88
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,140
Right?

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,150
Do a bunch of row operations
and you eventually get

90
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,050
something like this.

91
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,410
You'll get the reduced row
echelon form of A.

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,610
The reduced row echelon form
of A is going to look

93
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,840
something like this.

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,180
You're going to have some pivot
rows, some rows that

95
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,650
have pivot entries.

96
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,010
Let's say that's one of them.

97
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,980
Let's say that's one of them.

98
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,390
This will all have 0's
all the way down.

99
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,770
This one will have 0's.

100
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,760
Your pivot entry has to
be the only non-zero

101
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,180
entry in it's column.

102
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,220
And everything to the left
of it all has to be 0.

103
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,790
Let's say that this one isn't.

104
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,360
These are some non-zero
values.

105
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,600
These are 0.

106
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,690
We have another pivot
entry over here.

107
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,340
Everything else is 0.

108
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,350
Let's say everything else
are non-pivot entries.

109
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,510
So you come here and you have
a certain number of pivot

110
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,350
rows, or a certain number
of pivot entries, right?

111
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,630
And you got there by performing
linear row

112
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,880
operations on these guys.

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,670
So those linear row operations--
you know, I take

114
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,655
3 times row two, and I add it
to row one, and that's going

115
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:45,790
to become my new row two.

116
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,840
And you keep doing that and
you get these things here.

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,170
So, these things
here are linear

118
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,890
combinations of those guys.

119
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,830
Or another way to do it, you
can reverse those row

120
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,380
operations.

121
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,170
I could start with these
guys right here.

122
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,990
And I could just as easily
perform the reverse row

123
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,420
operations.

124
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,470
Any linear operation, you can
perform the reverse of it.

125
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,040
We've seen that multiple
times.

126
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,690
You could perform row operations
with these guys to

127
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,420
get all of these guys.

128
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,070
Or another way to view it is,
these vectors here, these row

129
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,400
vectors right here, they span
all of these-- or all of these

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,170
row vectors can be represented
of linear combinations of your

131
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,190
pivot rows right here.

132
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:29,280
Obviously, your non-pivot rows
are going to be all 0's.

133
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,380
And those are useless.

134
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,670
But, your pivot rows, if you
take linear combinations of

135
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,870
them, you can clearly do reverse
row echelon form and

136
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,190
get back to your matrix.

137
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,280
So, all of these guys can
be represented as linear

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,730
combinations of them.

139
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,140
And all of these pivot entries
are by definition-- well,

140
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,590
almost by definition--
they are linearly

141
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,900
independent, right?

142
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,970
Because I've got a 1 here.

143
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,320
No one else has a 1 there.

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,880
So this guy can definitely not
be represented as a linear

145
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,990
combination of the other guy.

146
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,710
So why am I going through
this whole exercise?

147
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,300
Well, we started off
saying we wanted a

148
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,470
basis for the row space.

149
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,600
We wanted some minimum set of
linearly independent vectors

150
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,610
that spans everything that
these guys can span.

151
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,920
Well, if all of these guys can
be represented as linear

152
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,660
combinations of these row
vectors in reduced row echelon

153
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,090
form-- or these pivot rows in
reduced row echelon form-- and

154
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,910
these guys are all linearly
independent, then they are a

155
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,980
reasonable basis.

156
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,810
So these pivot rows right here,
that's one of them, this

157
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,750
is the second one, this is the
third one, maybe they're the

158
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,380
only three.

159
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,050
This is just my particular
example.

160
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,715
That would be a suitable basis
for the row space.

161
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,520
So let me write this down.

162
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:57,480
The pivot rows in reduced row
echelon form of A are a basis

163
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,470
for the row space of A.

164
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,180
And the row space of A is the
same thing, or the column

165
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,230
space of A transpose.

166
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,370
The row space of A is the
same thing as the

167
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,490
column space of A transpose.

168
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,150
We've see that multiple times.

169
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,870
Now, if we want to know the
dimension of your column

170
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,770
space, we just count the number
of pivot rows you have.

171
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,530
So you just count the number
of pivot rows.

172
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,740
So the dimension of your row
space, which is the same thing

173
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,360
as the column space of A
transpose, is going to be the

174
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,420
number of pivot rows you have
in reduced row echelon form.

175
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,010
Or, even simpler, the number
of pivot entries you have

176
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,430
because every pivot entry
has a pivot row.

177
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:46,760
So we can write that the rank of
A transpose is equal to the

178
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:57,180
number of pivot entries in
reduced row echelon form of A.

179
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,490
Right?

180
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,950
Because every pivot entry
corresponds to a pivot row.

181
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,840
Those pivot rows are a suitable
basis for the entire

182
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,260
row space, because every row
could be made with a linear

183
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,910
combination of these guys.

184
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,270
And since all these can be, then
anything that these guys

185
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,970
can construct, these
guys can construct.

186
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,930
Fair enough.

187
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,350
Now, what is the rank of A?

188
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,160
This is the rank of A transpose
that we've been

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,440
dealing with so far.

190
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:30,350
The rank of A is equal to
the dimension of the

191
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,620
column space of A.

192
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:41,669
Or, you could say it's the
number of vectors in the basis

193
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,450
for the column space of A.

194
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:50,910
So if we take that same matrix
A that we used above, and we

195
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,860
instead we write it as a bunch
of column vectors, so c1, c2,

196
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,720
all the way to cn.

197
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,440
We have n columns right there.

198
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,490
The column space is essentially
the subspace

199
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,150
that's spanned by all of these
characters right here, right?

200
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,790
Spanned by each of these
column vectors.

201
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,810
So the column space of A is
equal to the span of c1, c2,

202
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,810
all the way to cn.

203
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,410
That's the definition of it.

204
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,280
But we want to know the number
of basis vectors.

205
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,020
And we've seen before-- we've
done this multiple times--

206
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,170
what suitable basis
vectors could be.

207
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,800
If you put this into reduced row
echelon form, and you have

208
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,480
some pivot entries and their
corresponding pivot columns,

209
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,820
so some pivot entries with
their corresponding pivot

210
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,380
columns just like that.

211
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,540
Maybe that's like that, and then
maybe this one isn't one,

212
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,620
and then this one is.

213
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,210
So you have a certain number
of pivot columns.

214
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:47,040
   

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,450
Let me do it with another
color right here.

216
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,190
When you put A into reduced row
echelon form, we learned

217
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,660
that the basis vectors, or the
basis columns that form a

218
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,090
basis for your column space,
are the columns that

219
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,000
correspond to the
pivot columns.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,750
So the first column here is a
pivot column, so this guy

221
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,780
could be a basis vector.

222
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,010
The second column is, so this
guy could be a pivot vector.

223
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,720
Or maybe the fourth one right
here, so this guy could be a

224
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,880
pivot vector.

225
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,690
So, in general, you just say
hey, if you want to count the

226
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,290
number basis vectors-- because
we don't even have to know

227
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,400
what they are to figure
out the rank.

228
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,230
We just have to know the
number they are.

229
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,960
Well you say, well for every
pivot column here, we have a

230
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,530
basis vector over there.

231
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,990
So we could just count the
number pivot columns.

232
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,510
But the number of pivot columns
is equivalent to just

233
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,510
the number of pivot entries we
have. Because every pivot

234
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,200
entry gets its own column.

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:42,220
So we could say that the rank of
A is equal to the number of

236
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:49,870
pivot entries in the reduced
row echelon form of A.

237
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,000
And, as you can see very
clearly, that's the exact same

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,940
thing that we deduced was
equivalent to the rank of A

239
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,480
transpose-- the dimension
of the

240
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,720
columns space of A transpose.

241
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,240
Or the dimension of the
row space of A.

242
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,450
So we can now write
our conclusion.

243
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,100
The rank of A is definitely the
same thing as the rank of

244
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,350
A transpose.

245
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,300
