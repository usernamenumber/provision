1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,350
I think you're pretty familiar
with the idea of matrix vector

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,860
products and what I want to do
in this video is show you that

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,440
taking a product of a vector
with a matrix is equivalent to

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,490
a transformation.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,020
It's actually a linear
transformation.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,630
Let's say we have some matrix A
and let's say that its terms

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,870
are, or its columns are v1--
column vector is v2,

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,130
all the way to vn.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,490
So this guy has n columns.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,780
Let's say it has m rows.

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,260
So it's an m by n matrix.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,126
And let's say I define
some transformation.

14
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:42,500
   

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:51,380
Let's say my transformation
goes from Rn to Rm.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,300
This is the domain.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,650
I can take any vector in Rn
and it will map it to some

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,730
factor in Rm.

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,650
And I define my transformation.

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:06,990
So T of x where this is some
vector in Rn, is equal to A--

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,050
this is this A.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,040
Let me write it in this
color right here.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,120
And it should be bolded.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,590
I kind of get careless sometimes
with the bolding.

25
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,370
But big bold A times
the vector x.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,150
So the first thing you might,
Sal, this transformation looks

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,510
very odd relative to how we've
been defining transformations

28
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,830
or functions so far.

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,770
So the first thing we have to
just feel comfortable with is

30
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,680
the idea that this is
a transformation.

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,430
So what are we doing?

32
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,530
We're taking something
from Rn and then

33
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,780
what does A x produce?

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,430
   

35
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,220
If we write A x like this, if
this is x where it's x1, x2.

36
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,220
It's going to have n terms
because it's in Rn.

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,760
This can be rewritten as x1
times v1 plus x2 times v2, all

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,690
the way to xn times vn.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,280
So it's going to be a sum of a
bunch of these column vectors.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,100
And each of these columns
vectors, v1, v2, all the way

41
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,670
to vn, what set are
they members of?

42
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,280
This is an m by n matrix, so
they're going to have m-- the

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,620
matrix has m rows, or
each of these column

44
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,720
vectors will have m entries.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,430
So all of these guys
are members of Rm.

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,870
So if I just take a linear
combination of all of these

47
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,310
guys, I'm going to get
another member of Rm.

48
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,440
So this guy right here is going
to be a member of Rm,

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,540
another vector.

50
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,590
So clearly, by multiplying my
vector x times a, I'm mapping,

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm creating a mapping from Rn--
and let me pick another

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,780
color-- to Rm.

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,640
And I'm saying it in very
general terms. Maybe n is 3,

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,810
maybe m is 5.

55
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,300
Who knows?

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,225
But I'm saying it in very
general terms. And so if this

57
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:03,340
is a particular instance, a
particular member of set Rn,

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,800
so it's that vector, our
transformation or our function

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,910
is going to map it to
this guy right here.

60
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,290
And this guy will be a
member of Rm and we

61
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,570
could call him a x.

62
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,660
Or maybe if we said a x equaled
b we could call him

63
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,150
the vector b-- whatever.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,460
But this is our transformation
mapping.

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,540
So this does fit our kind of
definition or our terminology

66
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,480
for a function or a
transformation as a mapping

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,760
from one set to another.

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,490
But it still might not be
satisfying because everything

69
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,900
we saw before looked
kind of like this.

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,690
If we had a transformation
I would write it like the

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,040
transformation of-- I would
write, you know, x1 and x2 and

72
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,100
xn is equal to.

73
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,670
   

74
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,450
I'd write m terms
here in commas.

75
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,740
How does this relate to that?

76
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,480
And to do that I'll do
a specific example.

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,680
So let's say that I had
the matrix-- let me

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,690
to a different letter.

79
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,270
Let's say I have my matrix
B and it is a

80
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,290
fairly simple matrix.

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,780
It's a 2, minus 1, 3 and 4.

82
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,211
And I define some
transformation.

83
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:20,959
So I define some transformation
T.

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,540
And it goes from R2 to R2.

85
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,080
And I define T.

86
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,270
T of some vector x is equal
to this matrix, B

87
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,260
times that vector x.

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,830
Now what would that equal?

89
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,850
Well the matrix is
right there.

90
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,310
Let me write it in purple.

91
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,570
2, minus 1, 3, and 4 times x.

92
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,130
x1, x2.

93
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,390
And so what does this equal?

94
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,310
Well this equals
another vector.

95
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,600
It equals a vector in the
co-domain R2 where the first

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,290
term is 2 times x1.

97
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,770
I'm just doing the definition
of matrix vector

98
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,310
multiplication.

99
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,840
2 times x1 plus minus 1
times x2, or minus x2.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,660
That's that row times
our vector.

101
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,570
And then the second row
times that factor.

102
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,910
We get 3 times x1.

103
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,530
   

104
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,210
Plus 4 times x2.

105
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,980
   

106
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,520
So this is what we might
be more familiar with.

107
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,530
I could rewrite this
transformation.

108
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,130
I could rewrite this
transformation as T of x1 x2

109
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,780
is equal to 2x1 minus x2 comma--
let me scroll over a

110
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,490
little bit, comma
3x1 plus 4x2.

111
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,100
So hopefully you're satisfied
that a matrix multiplication,

112
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,770
it isn't some new, exotic
form of transformation.

113
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,010
That they really are
just another way.

114
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,590
This statement right here is
just another way of writing

115
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,480
this exact transformation
right here.

116
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,490
Now, the next question you might
ask and I already told

117
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,400
you the answer to this at the
beginning of the video is, is

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,510
multiplication by a matrix
always going to be a linear

119
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,800
transformation?

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,730
Now what are the two constraints
for being a linear

121
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,390
transformation?

122
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,000
We know that the transformation
of two vectors,

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,290
a plus b, the sum of two vectors
should be equal to the

124
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,826
sum of their transformations.

125
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:34,770
The transformation of a plus
the transformation of b.

126
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,135
And then the other requirement
is that the transformation of

127
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:42,180
a scaled version of a vector
should be equal to a scaled

128
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,670
version of the transformation.

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,500
These are our two requirements
for being a linear

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,390
transformation.

131
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,300
So let's see if matrix
multiplication applies there.

132
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,210
And I've touched on this in the
past and I've even told

133
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,130
you that you should prove it.

134
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,000
I've already assumed you know
it, but I'll prove it to you

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,630
here because I'm tired of
telling you that you

136
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,120
should prove it.

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,500
I should do it at least once.

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,090
So let's see, matrix
multiplication.

139
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:11,220
If I multiply a matrix A times
some vector x, we know that--

140
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,780
let me write it this way.

141
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,120
We know that this is equivalent

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,270
to-- I said our matrix.

143
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,540
Let's say this is an
m by n matrix.

144
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,000
We can write any matrix
as just a

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
series of column vectors.

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,760
So this guy could have
n column vectors.

147
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,700
So let's say it's v1, v2, all
the way to vn column vectors.

148
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,050
And each of these guys are going
to have m components.

149
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,880
Times x1, x2, all the
way down to xn.

150
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,740
And we've seen this multiple,
multiple times before.

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,790
This, by the definition of
matrix vector multiplication

152
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,820
is equal to x1 times v1.

153
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,080
That times that.

154
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,270
This scalar times that vector
plus x2 times v2, all the way

155
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,270
to plus xn times vn.

156
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,650
This was by definition of a
matrix vector multiplication.

157
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,630
And of course, this is going
to-- and I did this at the top

158
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,160
of the video.

159
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,540
This is going to have right
here, this vector is going to

160
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,310
be a member of Rm.

161
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,920
It's going to have
m components.

162
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,520
So what happens if I take some
matrix A, some m by n matrix

163
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:30,450
A, and I multiply it times the
sum of two vectors a plus b?

164
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,100
So I could rewrite this as
this thing right here.

165
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,880
So my matrix A times.

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,309
The sum of a plus b, the first
term will just be a1 plus b1.

167
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:45,460
Second term is a2 plus b2, all
the way down to a n plus bn.

168
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,720
This is the same
thing as this.

169
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,290
I'm not saying a of a plus b.

170
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,260
I'm saying a times.

171
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,920
Maybe I should put a
dot right there.

172
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm multiplying the matrix.

173
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,000
I want to be careful
with my notation.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,110
This is the matrix vector
multiplication.

175
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,940
It's not some type of new
matrix dot product.

176
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,450
But this is the same
thing as this

177
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,660
multiplication right here.

178
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,060
And based on what I just told
you up here, which we've seen

179
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,780
multiple, multiple times, this
is the same thing as a1 plus

180
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,960
b1 times the first column
in a, which is that

181
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,890
vector right there.

182
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,560
This a is the same as this a.

183
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,130
So times v1.

184
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:28,820
Plus a2 plus b2 times v2,
all the way to plus an

185
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,180
plus bn times vn.

186
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,770
   

187
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,840
Each xi term here is just
being replaced by

188
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,850
an ai plus bi term.

189
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,910
So each x1 here is replaced
by an a1 plus b1 here.

190
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,090
This is equivalent to this.

191
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:51,440
And then from the fact that we
know that well vector products

192
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,700
times scalars exhibit the
distributive property, we can

193
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,290
say that this is equal
to a1 times v1.

194
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,710
Let me actually write all of
the a1 terms. Let me write

195
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:10,230
this. a1 times v1 plus b1 times
v1 plus a2 times v2 plus

196
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,460
b2 times v2, all the way
to plus a n times vn

197
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,170
plus bn times vn.

198
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,910
And then if we just re-associate
this, if we just

199
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,890
group all of the a's together,
all of the a terms together,

200
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,440
we get a1 plus a-- sorry.

201
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,870
a1 plus-- let me write it this
way. a1 times v1 plus a2 times

202
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,870
v2 plus, all the way,
a n times vn.

203
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,640
I just grabbed all
the a terms.

204
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,550
We get that plus all the b
terms. All the b terms I'll do

205
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,500
in this color.

206
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,310
All the b terms are like that.

207
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:57,850
So plus b1 times v1 plus b2
times v2, all the way to plus

208
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,560
bn times vn.

209
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,640
That's that guy right there.

210
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,340
Is equivalent to this statement
up here; I just

211
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,240
regrouped everything, which is
of course, equivalent to that

212
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,780
statement over there.

213
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,770
But what's this equal to?

214
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,210
This is equal to my vector--
these columns are remember,

215
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,160
the column for the
matrix capital A.

216
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,780
So this is equal to the matrix
capital A times a1, a2, all

217
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,650
the way down to a n, which
was our vector a.

218
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,020
And what's this equal to?

219
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,700
This is equal to plus
these v1's.

220
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,720
These are the columns for the a,
so it's equal to the matrix

221
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,440
A times my vector b.

222
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,140
b1, b2, all the way
down to bn.

223
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,140
This is my vector b.

224
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,260
We just showed you that if I add
my two vectors, a and b,

225
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,970
and then multiply it by the
matrix, it's completely

226
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,620
equivalent to multiplying each
of the vectors times the

227
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,850
matrix first and then
adding them up.

228
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,620
So we've satisfied-- and this
is for an m by n matrix.

229
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:08,470
So we've now satisfied this
first condition right there.

230
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,980
And then what about the
second condition?

231
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,080
And this one's even more
straightforward to understand.

232
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,420
c times a1, so let me
write it this way.

233
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,200
The vector a times-- sorry.

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,260
The matrix capital A times the
vector lowercase a-- let me do

235
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,495
it this way because
I want-- times the

236
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:29,650
vector c lowercase a.

237
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,940
So I'm multiplying my vector
times the scalar first. Is

238
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,530
equal to-- I can write
my big matrix A.

239
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,210
I've already labeled
its columns.

240
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,800
It's v1, v2, all
the way to vn.

241
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,780
That's my matrix a.

242
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,510
And then, what does
ca look like?

243
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,680
ca, you just multiply its
scalar times each of

244
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,530
the terms of a.

245
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:56,940
So it's ca1, ca2, all the
way down to c a n.

246
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,270
And what does this equal?

247
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,020
We know this, we've seen this
show multiple times before

248
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,230
right there.

249
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,670
So it just equals-- I'll write
a little bit lower.

250
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,000
That equals c a1 times this
column vector, times v1.

251
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,010
Plus c a2 times v2 times this
guy, all the way to

252
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,570
plus c a n times vn.

253
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,490
   

254
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,460
And if you just factor this
c out, once again, scalar

255
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,230
multiplication times vectors
exhibits the

256
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,530
distributive property.

257
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,420
I believe I've done a video
on that, but it's

258
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,700
very easy to prove.

259
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,960
So this will be equal to c
times-- I'll just stay in one

260
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,210
color right now-- a1 v1
plus a2 v2 plus all

261
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,600
the way to a n vn.

262
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
And what is this
thing equal to?

263
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,770
Well that's just our matrix A
times our vector-- or our

264
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,040
matrix uppercase A.

265
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,970
Maybe I'm overloading
the letter A.

266
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,470
My matrix uppercase A times
my vector lowercase a.

267
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,750
   

268
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,210
Where the lowercase a is just
this thing right here, a1, a2

269
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,700
and so forth.

270
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,320
This thing up here was the
same thing as that.

271
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
So I just showed you that if I
take my matrix and multiply it

272
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,020
times some vector that was
multiplied by a scalar first,

273
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,190
that's equivalent to first
multiplying the matrix times a

274
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,310
vector and then multiplying
by the scalar.

275
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,020
So we've shown you that matrix
times vector products or

276
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,880
matrix vector products satisfied
this condition of

277
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,320
linear transformations
and this condition.

278
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,680
So the big takeaway right here
is matrix multiplication.

279
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,580
And this is a important
takeaway.

280
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,620
   

281
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:03,570
Matrix multiplication or matrix
products with vectors

282
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:08,475
is always a linear
transformation.

283
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,200
   

284
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,540
And this is a bit
of a side note.

285
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,710
In the next video I'm going to
show you that any linear

286
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,460
transformation-- this is
incredibly powerful-- can be

287
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,260
represented by a matrix
product or by-- any

288
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,410
transformation on any vector can
be equivalently, I guess,

289
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,600
written as a product of that
vector with a matrix.

290
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,640
Has huge repercussions and you
know, just as a side note,

291
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,770
kind of tying this back
to your everyday life.

292
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,410
You have your Xbox, your Sony
Playstation and you know, you

293
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,950
have these 3D graphic programs
where you're running around

294
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,000
and shooting at things.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,980
And the way that the software
renders those programs where

296
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,160
you can see things from every
different angle, you have a

297
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,100
cube then if you kind of move
this way a little bit, the

298
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,070
cube will look more like this
and it gets rotated, and you

299
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,780
move up and down, these are all

300
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,010
transformations of matrices.

301
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,540
And we'll do this
in more detail.

302
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,830
These are all transformations of
vectors or the positions of

303
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,690
vectors and I'll do that
in a lot more detail.

304
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,390
And all of that is really just
matrix multiplication.

305
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,130
So all of these things that
you're doing in your fancy 3D

306
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,890
games on your Xbox or your
Playstation, they're all just

307
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,800
matrix multiplications.

308
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,840
And I'm going to prove that
to you in the next video.

309
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,960
And so when you have these
graphics cards or these

310
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,420
graphics engines, all they are--
you know, we're jumping

311
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,630
away from the theoretical.

312
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:32,650
But all these graphics
processors are, are hard wired

313
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,270
matrix multipliers.

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,970
If I have just a generalized,
some type of CPU, I have to in

315
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,230
software write how to
multiply matrices.

316
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,370
But if I'm making an Xbox or
something and 99% of what I'm

317
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,150
doing is just rotating these
abstract objects and

318
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,550
displaying them in transformed
ways, I should have a

319
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,590
dedicated piece of hardware, a
chip, that all it does-- it's

320
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,620
hard wired into it-- is
multiplying matrices.

321
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,750
And that's what those graphics
processors or graphics engines

322
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,380
really are.

323
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,689
