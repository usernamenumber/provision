1
00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:04,549
As we've already talked about as we exit
the 1800s and we get to the

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:07,620
early 1900s and we approach World War I

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,250
the various powers of Europe are really on
this race for empire; it was part of

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,580
national prestige and it helped build

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,129
national wealth

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:20,649
But of the major powers Germany and
Italy were relatively new as unified states.

7
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:24,630
The British Empire had been building their empire for hundreds of years;

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,660
the Germans on the other hand, even
though they have a very old culture

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,999
going back hundreds, or you could argue
thousands of years, as a unified state

10
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:34,960
they only existed since 1871.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,149
And that's only after the Franco-Prussian War which allowed the Prussians to unify all

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,650
of Germany.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,550
And the Italians only became fully
unified in 1870, also due to the

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,019
Franco-Prussian War

15
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:50,719
because the French had to focus on the
Germans, had to focus on the Prussians,

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,139
they couldn't protect the Papal states
anymore so that allowed the Italians to

17
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:59,280
unify it under their rule. So by the time we
get to 1914,

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,849
the beginning of World War I,

19
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,059
these two powers they were also on the
race for empire but there are only about

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:06,799
43 or 44 years old

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,939
and so they hadn't been able to build
as extensive of an empire as France and

22
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,090
especially as extensive an empire

23
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:18,469
as Great Britain. But this map right over
here shows what was the extense

24
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,270
of their-- how far their actual empires
did extend

25
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,369
Italy had control of Libya,

26
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,530
Eritrea,

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,320
and parts of what's today Somalia.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,790
And Germany had control -- it also had

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,530
holdings in Africa, possessions in Africa:

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,090
Togoland, which is modern-day Togo,
Cameroon which makes up er...

31
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,229
which modern-day Cameroon is part of;

32
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,299
German Southwest Africa that's now known
as Namibia; German East Africa which is

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,039
now Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. And
Germany also had holdings

34
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:57,840
in the Pacific and even in China. These
are the the Pacific islands that Germany

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,950
had possession of

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,380
and German New Guinea and it
even had control of the town of Tsingtao.

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,220
That is actually culturally interesting for
those of you watching this video in

38
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,559
2013:

39
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:16,569
Tsingtao is now a very popular Chinese
brand of beer; I think it is

40
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,089
the number 2 in the market -
uh... Chinese beer and it's

41
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:25,839
associated with China but it was
actually started by German settlers in

42
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:30,439
Tsingtao in 1903. So actually its roots are with the

43
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,200
Germans who obviously have a long
tradition of producing

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
beers

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,659
and so Tsingtao you could argue it's a
Chinese beer, it's produced in China

46
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,650
but it had its roots in German imperial rule.
