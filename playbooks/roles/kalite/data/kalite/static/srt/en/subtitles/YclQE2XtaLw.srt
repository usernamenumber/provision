1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,540
Where we left off in the
last video I kind

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,400
of gave you a question.

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,240
Find an interval so that we're
reasonably confident-- we'll

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,220
talk a little bit more about why
I have to give this kind

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,570
of vague wording right here--
reasonably confident that

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,030
there's a 95% chance that the
true population mean, which is

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,360
p, which is the same thing as
the mean of the sampling

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,850
distribution of the
sampling mean.

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,570
So there's a 95% chance that
the true mean-- and

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,360
let me put this here.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,910
This is also the same thing as
the mean of the sampling

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,790
distribution of the sampling
mean is in that interval.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,740
And to do that let me just
throw out a few ideas.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:46,295
What is the probability that if
I take a sample and I were

16
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,870
to take a mean of that sample,
so the probability that a

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:59,260
random sample mean is within two
standard deviations of the

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:04,500
sampling mean, of
our sample mean?

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,610
So what is this probability
right over here?

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,100
Let's just look at our
actual distribution.

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,950
So this is our distribution,
this right here is our

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,020
sampling mean.

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,580
Maybe I should do it in
blue because that's

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,730
the color up here.

25
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,180
This is our sampling mean.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,330
And so what is the probability
that a random sampling mean is

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,970
going to be two standard
deviations?

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,440
Well a random sampling is a
sample from this distribution.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,980
It is a sample from the sampling
distribution of the

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,040
sample mean.

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,400
So it's literally what is the
probability of finding a

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,360
sample within two standard
deviations of the mean?

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,150
That's one standard deviation,
that's another standard

34
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,980
deviation right over there.

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,140
In general, if you haven't
committed this to memory

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,340
already, it's not a bad thing
to commit to memory, is that

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,710
if you have a normal
distribution the probability

38
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,170
of taking a sample within two
standard deviations is 95--

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,130
and if you want to get
a little bit more

40
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,600
accurate it's 95.4%.

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,860
But you could say it's roughly--
or maybe I could

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,210
write it like this--
it's roughly 95%.

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,400
And really that's all that
matters because we have this

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,910
little funny language here
called reasonably confident,

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,800
and we have to estimate the
standard deviation anyway.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,130
In fact, we could say if we
want, I could say that it's

47
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,820
going to be exactly
equal to 95.4%.

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,240
But in general, two standard
deviations, 95%, that's what

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,740
people equate with each other.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,680
Now this statement is the
exact same thing as the

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,170
probability that the sample
mean, that the sampling mean--

52
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,440
not the sample mean, the
probability of the mean of the

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,700
sampling distribution is within
two standard deviations

54
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,350
of the sampling distribution of
x is also going to be the

55
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,750
same number, is also going
to be equal to 95.4%.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,220
These are the exact
same statements.

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,170
If x is within two standard
deviations of this, then this,

58
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,580
then the mean, is within two
standard deviations of x.

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,400
These are just two ways of
phrasing the same thing.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,090
Now we know that the mean of the
sampling distribution, the

61
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,760
same thing as a mean of the
population distribution, which

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,940
is the same thing as the
parameter p-- the proportion

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,670
of people or the proportion of
the population that is a 1.

64
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,780
So this right here is the same
thing as the population mean.

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,900
So this statement right here
we can switch this with p.

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,290
So the probability that p is
within two standard deviations

67
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,260
of the sampling distribution
of x is 95.4%.

68
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,830
Now we don't know what this
number right here is.

69
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,890
But we have estimated it.

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,870
Remember, our best estimate of
this is the true standard, or

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,060
it is the true standard
deviation of the population

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,110
divided by 10.

73
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,350
We can estimate the true
standard deviation of the

74
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,300
population with our sampling
standard deviation, which was

75
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,000
0.5, 0.5 divided by 10.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,980
Our best estimate of the
standard deviation of the

77
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,190
sampling distribution of the
sample mean is 0.05.

78
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,470
So now we can say-- and I'll
switch colors-- the

79
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,670
probability that the parameter
p, the proportion of the

80
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,720
population saying 1, is within
two times-- remember, our best

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,600
estimate of this right here is
0.05 of a sample mean that we

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,500
take is equal to 95.4%.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,770
And so we could say the
probability that p is within 2

84
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,650
times 0.05 is going to be equal
to-- 2.0 is going to be

85
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:53,290
0.10 of our mean is equal to
95-- and actually let me be a

86
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,230
little careful here.

87
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,420
I can't say the equal now,
because over here if we knew

88
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,110
this, if we knew this parameter
of the sampling

89
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,120
distribution of the sample
mean, we could

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,250
say that it is 95.4%.

91
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,280
We don't know it.

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,050
We are just trying to find our
best estimator for it.

93
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,450
So actually what I'm going to
do here is actually just say

94
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,260
is roughly-- and just to show
that we don't even have that

95
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,510
level of accuracy, I'm going
to say roughly 95%.

96
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,680
We're reasonably confident that
it's about 95% because

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,880
we're using this estimator that
came out of our sample,

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,070
and if the sample is really
skewed this is going to be a

99
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,950
really weird number.

100
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,810
So this is why we just have to
be a little bit more exact

101
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,590
about what we're doing.

102
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,890
But this is the tool
for at least saying

103
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,910
how good is our result.

104
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,840
So this is going to
be about 95%.

105
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,500
Or we could say that the
probability that p is within

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,870
0.10 of our sample mean
that we actually got.

107
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,840
So what was the sample mean
that we actually got?

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,460
It was 0.43.

109
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,550
So if we're within 0.1 of 0.43,
that means we are within

110
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:07,730
0.43 plus or minus 0.1 is
also, roughly, we're

111
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,850
reasonably confident
it's about 95%.

112
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,870
And I want to be very clear.

113
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,060
Everything that I started all
the way from up here in brown

114
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,610
to yellow and all this magenta,
I'm just restating

115
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,340
the same thing inside of this.

116
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,490
It became a little bit more
loosey-goosey once I went from

117
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,950
the exact standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,340
to an estimator for it.

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,960
And that's why this is just
becoming-- I kind of put the

120
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,540
squiggly equal signs there
to say we're reasonably

121
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,110
confident-- and I even got rid
of some of the precision.

122
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,950
But we just found
our interval.

123
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,240
An interval that we can be
reasonably confident that

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,460
there's a 95% probability that
p is within that, is going to

125
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,190
be 0.43 plus or minus 0.1.

126
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,460
Or an interval of-- we have
a confidence interval.

127
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:59,620
We have a 95% confidence
interval of, and we could say,

128
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,240
0.43 minus 0.1 is 0.33.

129
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,710
If we write that as a percent
we could say 33% to-- and if

130
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:16,630
we add the 0.1, 0.43 plus
0.1 we get 53%-- to 53%.

131
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,890
So we are 95% confident.

132
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,340
So we're not saying kind of
precisely that the probability

133
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,550
of the actual proportion is 95%,
but we're 95% confident

134
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,870
that the true proportion
is between 33% and 55%.

135
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,830
That p is in this
range over here.

136
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,980
Or another way, and you'll see
this in a lot of surveys that

137
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,070
have been done, people will say
we did a survey and we got

138
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:55,180
43% will vote for number one,
and number one in this case is

139
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,430
candidate B.

140
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,420
   

141
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,450
And then the other side, since
everyone else voted for

142
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:13,290
candidate A, 57% will
vote for A.

143
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,460
And then they're going to
put on margin of error.

144
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,750
And you'll see this in any
survey that you see on TV.

145
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,350
They'll put a margin of error.

146
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,920
And the margin of error is just
another way of describing

147
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,480
this confidence interval.

148
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,330
And they'll say that the margin
of error in this case

149
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:37,200
is 10%, which means that there's
a 95% confidence

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,919
interval, if you go plus or
minus 10% from that value

151
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,510
right over there.

152
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,850
And I really want to emphasize,
you can't say with

153
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,620
certainty that there is a 95%
chance that the true result

154
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,180
will be within 10% of this,
because we had to estimate the

155
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,030
standard deviation of
the sampling mean.

156
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,140
But this is the best measure
we can with the information

157
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,500
you have. If you're going to
do a survey of 100 people,

158
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,570
this is the best kind of
confidence that we can get.

159
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,600
And this number is actually
fairly big.

160
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,560
So if you were to look at this
you would say, roughly there's

161
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,360
a 95% chance that the true
value of this number is

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,100
between 33% and 53%.

163
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,240
So there's actually still a
chance that candidate B can

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,170
win, even though only
43% of your 100 are

165
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,920
going to vote for him.

166
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,250
If you wanted to make it a
little bit more precise you

167
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,770
would want to take
more samples.

168
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,390
You can imagine.

169
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,710
Instead of taking 100 samples,
instead of n being 100, if you

170
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,310
made n equal 1,000, then you
would take this number over

171
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,800
here, you would take this number
here and divide by the

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,570
square root of 1,000 instead
of the square root of 100.

173
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,250
So you'd be dividing
by 33 or whatever.

174
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,550
And so then the size of the
standard deviation of your

175
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,760
sampling distribution
will go down.

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,350
And so the distance of two
standard deviations will be a

177
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,480
smaller number, and so
then you will have a

178
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,210
smaller margin of error.

179
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,290
And maybe you want to get the
margin of error small enough

180
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,920
so that you can figure out
decisively who's going to win

181
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,340
the election.

182
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,734
