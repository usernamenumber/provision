00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,867
Find the area and the perimeter of the polygon

2
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:06,933
so lets start with the area first

3
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,733
so the area of this polygon

4
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,467
and there's kind of two parts to this

5
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:13,267
first you have this part that's kind of rectangular

6
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,000
or it is rectangular

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,667
this part right over here

8
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,333
and that area is pretty straightforward

9
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,333
it's just going to be base times height

10
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,600
so the area's going to be 8 times 4

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,733
8 times 4 for the rectangular part

12
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,600
and then we have this triangular part up here

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,533
so we have this area up here

14
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:36,000
and for a triangle this area is base times height times 1/2

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,267
that actually makes a lot of sense

16
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,133
because you just multiply base times height

17
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:39,633
you would get this entire area

18
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,667
you get the area of the entire rectangle

19
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,267
and you see that the triangle is exactly half of it

20
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,667
if you took this part of the triangle

21
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,600
and you flip it over, you'd fill up that space

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
and you took this part of the triangle

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,933
and you flip it over, you'd fill up that space

24
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,867
so the triangle's area is half of

25
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:57,600
the triangle's base times the triangle's height

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,067
so plus 1/2 times the triangles base which is 8 inches

27
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,267
and the triangles height which is 4 inches.

28
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:09,600
so let us calculate it this gives us

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:24,400
it is not 4, triangles height is 3, so let us go back

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:37,333
and calculate it area = 32 + 1/2 * 8*3 = 32 + 12 = 44

31
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,000
area of the figure is 44

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,267
now let us do the perimeter.We need to figure out the

33
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,467
sum of the sides. If we need to put a fence

34
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:51,200
what is the length that we need to cover

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:13,000
so the perimeter = 8+4+5+5+4 =26 inches

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:32,533
Let me get the unit right, here we are multiplying

37
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:38,200
8 inches by 4 inches we get 32 square inches and

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,000
here we multiply 8 inches by 3 inches we get 24 square inches

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,067
divide by 2 we get 12 square inches.

40
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:46,600
area = 44 square inches, perimeter is 26 inches

41
00:02:46,600 --> 99:59:59,999
area is two dimensional and perimeter is one dimensional
