1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have to solve 2x^2+5=6x.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we have a quadratic equation here, but just to make it

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
put it into a form we are more familiar with.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's try to put it into standard form. And standard form of course is ax^2+bx+c=0.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we essentially have to take the 6x and get rid of it from the right hand side.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we just have a 0 on the right hand side, and to do that

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's just subtract from both sides of this equation.
