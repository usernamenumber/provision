1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,120
Let's think a little bit
about some of the

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,820
properties of alcohol.

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,260
So the general formula for an
alcohol we saw is some type of

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,050
group or chain of carbons bonded
to an oxygen, bonded to

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,210
a hydrogen.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,980
And of course, the oxygen
will have two lone

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,220
pairs just like that.

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,060
Let's compare this to water.

10
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,680
So water just looks like this.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,260
You have a hydrogen bonded to
an oxygen, bonded to another

12
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,190
hydrogen with two lone pairs.

13
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,960
Now in the case of water,
the oxygen is much more

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,090
electronegative than the
hydrogen, so it hogs the

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,350
electrons towards it.

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,620
So you have a partial negative
charge at the oxygen end.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,060
Then you have partial positive
charges at the hydrogen ends.

18
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,600
That's what allows oxygen to
kind of-- or sorry-- that's

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,680
what allows water to bond to
itself or to have not a

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,910
ridiculously low
boiling point.

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,580
So let me show this.

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,980
Let me copy and paste this.

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,680
We've seen all this before
in regular chemistry.

24
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,099
So copy and paste.

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,180
So let me draw some more
water molecules here.

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,740
Let me draw another water
molecule here.

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,320
So you see water because the
oxygen end has a partial

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,570
negative charge and the hydrogen
ends have partial

29
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,210
positive charges, the oxygen of
one water molecule will be

30
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,710
attracted to the hydrogen of
another water molecule.

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,390
And we've seen this before.

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,580
This we call hydrogen bonding.

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,905
So that right there is
hydrogen bonding.

34
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:32,530
   

35
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,940
The exact same thing can happen
with alcohols, although

36
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,290
alcohols really only have
the partial positive

37
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,120
charge on the hydrogen.

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,060
We don't know exactly what's
going on here.

39
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,500
We probably have carbons
bonded to the oxygen.

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,200
And with the carbons, they're
reasonably electronegative.

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,580
They're not going to have their
electrons hogged as much

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,130
as a hydrogen would.

43
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,620
So in the case of an alcohol--
let me draw.

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,250
Instead of having this R for
radical there, let me make it

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,290
a little bit more concrete.

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,140
Let me draw an actual alcohol.

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,580
So an actual alcohol.

48
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,400
Maybe we have methanol.

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,620
Maybe we have methanol that
would look like that.

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,060
It has a hydrogen
right over here.

51
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,630
Oxygen is much more
electronegative than the

52
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,490
hydrogen, so you have a partial
negative charge there.

53
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,680
And then you have a partial
positive charge there.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,220
So it too, because of these
hydrogen bonds, it will have a

55
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,500
reasonable boiling point.

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,850
It won't just turn immediately
into the gaseous state.

57
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,576
It would actually try to
bond to each other.

58
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:36,750
Let me copy and paste that.

59
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,680
So it can also form the
hydrogen bonds.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,030
Although they won't to be quite
as strong as what you

61
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,660
see in water.

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,770
And that's why something like
methanol actually has a lower

63
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,950
boiling point than water.

64
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,390
It's easy to make it boil.

65
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,470
It's easier to make these bonds
break apart because you

66
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,980
don't have as much of the
hydrogen bonding.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,320
So this is an example
of hydrogen

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
bonding with methanol.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,575
Now because methanol can have
hydrogen bonding and it has

70
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:06,920
this slight polarity to it and
water obviously has hydrogen

71
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,390
bonding, methanol is actually
miscible in water.

72
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,430
And all that means is that it's
soluble in water in any

73
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,020
proportion.

74
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,380
No matter how much methanol
or how much water

75
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,900
you have, it is soluble.

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,690
So if I were to draw some
methanol molecules-- actually,

77
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,110
maybe this is the water
right here.

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,380
So if you draw a methanol
molecule right there, that

79
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,580
would have a hydrogen bond
right over there.

80
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,690
If I were to draw another
methanol molecule maybe right

81
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,590
over here, you would have
another hydrogen bond right

82
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,250
over there.

83
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,470
And that's what allows
methanol to

84
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,730
be soluble in water.

85
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,930
Now, as this chain grows, or
if you have alcohols with

86
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,140
longer radical chains, then
they become less and less

87
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,060
soluble in water.

88
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,980
But their boiling points
actually do go up.

89
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,640
And let's think about
why that is.

90
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,760
So if I have something like--
let me do butanol.

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,430
So butanol's going to
have 4 carbons.

92
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,100
So it's going to be H3C, H3--
let me just draw it like H3C,

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,260
CH2, Ch2, CH-- let me
do it like this.

94
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,579
H2C.

95
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,440
Then that carbon, that last
carbon right there is going to

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,630
be bonded to the oxygen.

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,680
It's going to be bonded
to an oxygen, which

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,890
is bonded to a hydrogen.

99
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,530
Now, when you have a situation
like this, the oxygen will

100
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,990
have a partial negative
charge.

101
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,080
The hydrogen will still have
a partial positive charge.

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,180
Just like we saw up
here with both the

103
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,050
water and the methanol.

104
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,670
But now you have this big thing

105
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,260
here that has no polarity.

106
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,660
So this part of the alcohol is
not going to be soluble in

107
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,640
water, and it's going to make it
harder for this part to be

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,090
soluble over here.

109
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,130
So this right here
is less soluble.

110
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,210
This is less soluble.

111
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,730
It'd still be a little
bit soluble.

112
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,190
So if you have some oxygen here,
you will still have a

113
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,890
little bit of the hydrogen
bonding.

114
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,740
You still will have a little
bit of the hydrogen

115
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,360
bonding going on.

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,250
But this part is kind of-- you
can imagine it's almost-- it

117
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,370
doesn't want to dissolve
with the water.

118
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,620
It is non-polar.

119
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,900
   

120
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,110
You could actually, for
example, butanol in

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,700
particular, it actually
is soluble in water.

122
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,280
But not in any proportion.

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,800
So methanol is miscible.

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,390
Let me write this.

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,210
This is a new word.

126
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,530
I don't think I've ever used
it before in the context of

127
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,650
the organic chemistry videos.

128
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,660
So methanol is-- let me write
that in a brighter color since

129
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,360
it's a new word.

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,270
Methanol is miscible, which
just means soluble in any

131
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,520
proportion.

132
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,450
   

133
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,240
So I don't care what percent
is methanol,

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,140
what percent is water.

135
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,950
The methanol will dissolve
into the water in any

136
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,100
proportion.

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,380
If you look at butanol, it
is soluble but not in any

138
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:01,910
proportion.

139
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,900
If you had a ton of butanol,
some of it would not dissolve

140
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,660
in the water.

141
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,750
So this is soluble.

142
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,150
So the butanol right here
is soluble, but

143
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,430
not miscible in water.

144
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,940
If you have too much of the
butanol, all of a sudden, some

145
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,930
of it will not actually be
able to be dissolved.

146
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,460
If this was a decanol or
something with a really long

147
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,150
carbon chain, then of
course, it's going

148
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,290
to be very non soluble.

149
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,030
You might be able to get a
couple of molecules in the

150
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,600
water, but most of them
will not dissolve.

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,940
Now the other reason-- I
hinted-- look, you know the

152
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,260
reason why the alcohols have a
reasonable-- not too low of a

153
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,580
boiling point is that
they're able to do

154
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,930
this hydrogen bonding.

155
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:45,840
But you would say well, look.

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,970
You know, these longer carbon
chains, these are going to

157
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,140
have less of the hydrogen
bonding going on.

158
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,230
Maybe these would have
lower boiling points.

159
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,680
But actually, the longer the
chain gets, these actually

160
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,210
have higher boiling points.

161
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,830
And that's because
these chains can

162
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,780
interact with each other.

163
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,930
So the longer the chain, so
longer R or the longer R

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,800
chain, I guess, I could say,
we could say the higher the

165
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,620
boiling point in an alcohol.

166
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,420
Higher boiling point.

167
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,280
It's harder.

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,840
You have to put more heat into
the system or the temperature

169
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,860
has to be higher for the
things to break apart.

170
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,000
And that's because this is one
decanol molecule here, another

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
decanol molecule might
look like this.

172
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,950
Maybe it might look like this.

173
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,460
You have an oxygen and a
hydrogen and then you have

174
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,420
your carbons.

175
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:38,990
So you have your CH,
your CH2, CH2, H3C.

176
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,290
So you have this other
butanol here.

177
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,090
And what the interaction between
these two chains are--

178
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,090
these are the van
der Waal forces.

179
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,950
So even though they have
no [INAUDIBLE],

180
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,380
so these guys are going to have
some polar interactions.

181
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,650
They're going to have the
hydrogen bonding.

182
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,610
We've seen that multiple
times already.

183
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,250
But these long chains, they're
going to have the London

184
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,020
dispersion forces, which are a
subset of van der Waal forces.

185
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,840
Where even though they're
neutral, every now and then,

186
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,790
one of these might become
slightly negative on one side.

187
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,410
So you might have
a very temporary

188
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,670
partial negative charge.

189
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,370
And that's just because
of the randomness of

190
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,720
how electrons move.

191
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,110
On this side of the molecule,
all of a sudden, you might

192
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,630
have more electrons
over there.

193
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,460
So you have a partial
negative charge.

194
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,220
And because of that, you're
going to have-- the electrons

195
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,395
over here, they're not going
to want to be there.

196
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,210
So you're going to want to have
a partial positive charge

197
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,570
there and you're going to have
a very temporary interaction.

198
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,910
That's a very weak force.

199
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,880
Much weaker than
hydrogen bonds.

200
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,720
But as these chains get longer
and longer, as they possibly

201
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,840
even get intertwined with each
other and get close to each

202
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,230
other, these London dispersion
forces or van der Waal forces

203
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,220
are going to keep propagating.

204
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,970
So all of a sudden, maybe these
guys are going to be

205
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,900
attracted to each other and
that's going to disappear.

206
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,790
Than these guys are going be
attracted to each other and

207
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,000
then that's going
to disappear.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
And then these are going to be
attracted to each other and

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,000
then that's going
to disappear.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,940
And so you can imagine, the
longer the chain, the more of

211
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,290
these type of interactions
you're going to have. The more

212
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,970
attracted they're going
to be to each other.

213
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,720
And it's going to be harder to
break them apart, higher

214
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,680
boiling point.

215
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,810
So those are just kind of the
two big takeaways on the

216
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,350
properties of alcohols.

217
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,170
Especially smaller chained
alcohols are soluble in water.

218
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:13,610
The very small ones are
completely miscible.

219
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,026
And the longer the chain you
have, the harder it is to

220
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:16,870
dissolve in water.

221
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,130
But also, the higher
the boiling point.

222
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,940
The harder it is to break them
apart because you have these

223
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,180
London dispersion forces.

224
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:23,399
