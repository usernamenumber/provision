1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,030
What is the cost of 14.6 gallons
of gasoline at $2.70

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,290
per gallon?

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:15,600
So we have 14.6 gallons,
and each gallon's

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,300
going to cost $2.70.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,530
Or we can even view $2.70
as 2.7 dollars.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,040
Let's just multiply times 2.7.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,870
It makes things a little
bit simpler.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,490
I think you'll appreciate $2.70
is the same thing as 2.7

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,340
dollars per gallon.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,030
So let's multiply this out.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,620
So first we have, and just as a
reminder, when you multiply

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,280
decimals, you just have to treat
the numbers like whole

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,760
numbers and then worry about
the decimals later.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,370
So right now, we can just view
this as 146 times 27, and then

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,060
we'll worry about
the decimals.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,950
So first we have
a 7 times a 6.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,040
7 times 6 is 42.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,530
Regroup the 4.

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,210
7 times 4 is 28, plus 4 is 32.

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,730
Regroup the 3.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,730
7 times 1 is 7, plus 3 is 10.

23
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,790
So we get 7 times
146 is 1,022.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,840
Now we're going to
deal with this 2.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,380
But this 2, at least before we
consider the decimal, is

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,160
really a 20.

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,310
So we're going to
put a 0 here.

28
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,600
We're doing it exactly the same
way we do a traditional

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,520
multiplication problem.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,620
We're ignoring the
decimals for now.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,430
2 times 6 is 12.

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,660
Carry the 1, or regroup the 1.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,580
We can ignore these
guys right now.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,800
2 times 4 is 8, plus 1 is 9.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,360
2 times 1 is 2, and
now we can add.

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,600
   

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,410
And we get 2 plus 0 is 2.

38
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,390
2 plus 2 is 4.

39
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,720
0 plus 9 is 9.

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,170
1 plus 2 is 3.

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,650
Now we've figured out what
146 times 27 is.

42
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,950
It's 3,942.

43
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,070
But this wasn't 146 times 27.

44
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,030
It was 14.6 times 2.7.

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,980
So now we have to worry
about the decimals.

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,130
We just count how many numbers
are sitting behind decimals.

47
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,200
We have one right there and
a second one right there.

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,710
So our product has to have
two numbers to the

49
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,670
right of the decimal.

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,160
So one, two, stick it
right over there.

51
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,860
So for 14.6 gallons of gas at
$2.70 per gallon, it's going

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,110
to cost $39.42.

53
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,199
