00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:04,674
We've talked a lot about the kidney,
but I want to point out

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:09,277
that the kidney is not the only organ 
involved in controlling the blood pressure.

3
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:19,703
In fact the liver plays a really really important role in helping you create the right enzymes and proteins to control blood pressure.

4
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:24,212
So I'm gonna sketch out real quick some liver cells here.

5
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:28,680
These liver cells are busy making a lot of different proteins.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,611
One of them is called angiotensinogen.

7
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:42,451
Angiotensinogen gets made by the liver cells 
and they dump it out into the blood vessel.

8
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:46,643
If we were to draw angiotensinogen
it's actually a pretty large molecule,

9
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:48,867
it has lots and lots of amino acids.

10
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,137
Amino acids are these tiny little circles that I'm drawing.

11
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,779
I'm connecting them with little bonds.

12
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:58,786
You can imagine amino acids like pearls on a necklace.

13
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:10,074
In total angiotensinogen has about 450+ amino acids.

14
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:16,107
So it's a pretty long chain.
542 amino acids actually.

15
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:24,277
It's a pretty long chain, I'm not gonna draw all of it, 
but you get the idea that it's some crazy long chain like that.

16
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:29,982
It's little amino acids all the way through.

17
00:01:29,982 --> 00:01:37,809
So this huge protein gets put into the blood vessels
by the liver cells and starts floating around.

18
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:42,938
If you would zoom in on the little protein,
if you could give it a little face,

19
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:47,358
it would maybe look something like this, because 
even though it's floating through the body,

20
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:52,037
it's basically asleep, it's not really active.

21
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:55,145
I just want you to keep that in the back of your mind.

22
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:59,541
Even though it's there, it's not truly active.

23
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,776
It's not really doing a lot.

24
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:05,038
At the same time you've got the kidney.

25
00:02:05,038 --> 00:02:10,307
The kidney is not idle, 
the kidney is busy making a hormone of its own.

26
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:15,982
You know there's the afferent arteriole.

27
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:20,868
The afferent arteriole is the blood vessel 
that's headed into the glomerulus.

28
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:29,906
It's headed into the part of the kidney 
where all of the urine is initially made.

29
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:32,776
In the afferent arteriole blood is going that way.

30
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:39,170
Lining this afferent arteriole, there are these little cells 
all the way through like this.

31
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,736
These are called the juxtaglomerular cells.

32
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:52,635
I'm doing a simplified version of it,
because this is the part I really want to focus on.

33
00:02:52,635 --> 00:03:01,170
These juxtaglomerular cells have in them little granules, 
they're sometimes even called granular cells.

34
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:09,008
These granular cells sense,either themselves 
or one of the neighbors helped them sense

35
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:10,622
when the blood pressure is low.

36
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:15,259
Then these granules get dumped into the blood stream.

37
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:28,257
If you look at the microscopic level,
you can see these little proteins called renin.

38
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:38,799
These are proteins that act at a distant site, 
we call those hormones.

39
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,788
These peptide or protein hormones are basically 
gonna work on cells far away.

40
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:52,590
If the renin is floating along in the blood and the angiotensinogen is floating in the blood, they might meet up.

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:00,079
In a blood vessels in your arm, 
or maybe in a blood vessel in your leg.
