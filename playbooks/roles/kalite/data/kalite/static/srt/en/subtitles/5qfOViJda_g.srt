1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,960
Find the value of 5 to
the third power.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,020
Let me rewrite that.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,910
We have 5 to the third power.

5
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,340
Now, it's important to remember,
this does not

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,630
mean 5 times 3.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,770
This means 5 times itself three
times, so this is equal

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,690
to 5 times 5 times 5.

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,930
5 times 3, just as a bit of a
refresher so you realize the

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,680
difference, 5 times 3-- let
me write it over here.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:41,370
5 times 3 is equal to
5 plus 5 plus 5.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,820
So when you multiply by 3,
you're adding the number to

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,690
itself three times.

14
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,520
When you take it to the third
power, you're multiplying the

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,980
number by itself three times.

16
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,720
So 5 times 3, you've seen
that before, that's 15.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,650
But 5 to the third power, 5
times itself three times, is

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,400
equal to-- well, 5 times 5 is
25, and then 25 times 5 is

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,760
125, so this is equal to 125.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,270
And we're done!

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,599
