1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:06,090
So we have fourteen x plus four over negative three x minus two

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,905
is equal to eight.

3
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,294
And I'll give you a few moments

4
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:13,313
to see if you can tackle it on your own.

5
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,803
So this equation right here -

6
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:18,805
at first it doesn't look like a straightforward linear equation

7
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:22,039
We have one expression on top of another expression.

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,735
But as we will see we can simplify this

9
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:27,136
to turn it into a linear equation.

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,137
So the first thing that I want to do is -

11
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:33,121
I don't like this negative three x plus two sitting here in the denominator -

12
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,935
it makes me stressed.

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:38,740
So, I want to multiply both sides of this equation

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:46,472
times negative three x minus two...times negative three x minus two

15
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:47,802
What does that do for us?

16
00:00:47,802 --> 00:00:49,739
Well, on the left hand side you have

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,000
this negative three x minus two

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,740
is going to be over negative three x minus two

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,582
They will cancel out.

20
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,540
And so you are left with on the left-hand side

21
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,875
your fourteen x plus four

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,334
and on your right-hand side

23
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,953
you just have to multiply eight times negative three x minus two.

24
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:09,121
So you are left with...

25
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:15,003
well, eight times negative three x is negative twenty-four x.

26
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:20,871
And eight times negative two is negative sixteen.

27
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,069
And there you have it -

28
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:25,403
we have simplified this to just a traditional linear equation -

29
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:26,873
we've got variables on both sides

30
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,473
so we can just keep simplifying.

31
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,950
So, the first thing that I want to do is -

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,376
let's say we want to put all of our x terms on the left-hand side.

33
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:35,625
So I want to get rid...

34
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:39,533
I want to get rid of this negative twenty-four x right over here.

35
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,737
So the best way to do that -

36
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,137
I'm going to add twenty-four x to the right hand side.

37
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,136
I can't just do it to the right-hand side,

38
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,804
I have to also do it to the left-hand side.

39
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:51,869
And so, I am left with, on the left-hand side,

40
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,958
fourteen x plus twenty-four x is thirty-eight x.

41
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,373
(and then I have the plus 4)

42
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,455
is equal to -

43
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:02,205
well, negative twenty-four x plus twenty-four x -

44
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,334
those cancel each other out.

45
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,407
And we are left with just the negative sixteen.

46
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,137
Negative sixteen.

47
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:12,129
Now, we just have to get rid of this four here -

48
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,850
Well, let's subtract that four from both sides.

49
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,957
And we are left with -

50
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,761
this is the home stretch now -

51
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:22,118
we are left with

52
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,369
thirty-eight x...

53
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:26,119
thirty-eight x is equal to

54
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,604
negative sixteen minus four,

55
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:29,268
is negative twenty.

56
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:32,077
And so we can divide both sides of this equation

57
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,704
by thirty-eight...

58
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,670
by thirty-eight.

59
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,334
And we are left with x is equal to

60
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,205
negative twenty over thirty-eight

61
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,135
which can be simplified further -

62
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,736
both the numerator and the denominator is divisible by two

63
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:48,469
so let's divide the numerator and denominator by two

64
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:52,136
and we get negative ten over nineteen.

65
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:56,875
X is equal to negative ten over nineteen.

66
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,806
And we are done.

67
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,871
I encourage you to validate this for yourself -

68
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,078
(it's a little bit of a hairy number right over here)

69
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,704
but to take this number,

70
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,404
substitute it back into our original equation

71
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:08,623
and validate that it actually does satisfy

72
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:11,000
that equation.
