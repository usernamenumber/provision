00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:11,171
I'm T.A. McCann, I'm the founder and CEO of Gist. Which was acquired by BlackBerry about a year ago.

2
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:17,701
Gist is sort of next generation address book, so all of us are connected to so many different people in so many different places

3
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:25,117
Gist's primary function is to bring all those address books together, bring my inbox, my contact manager, my FaceBook, LinkedIn, Twitter

4
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:30,033
All those contacts into one place. But its really about harnessing the power of your network

5
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:34,004
And understanding the context of the people you are interacting with. I think for

6
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:39,670
most entrepreneurs, they want to solve the problem for themselves. Because they're the first user.

7
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,437
So, I wanted to build that product for myself. But, as an engineer and as somebody who understands software,

8
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,138
How would I do it is almost as important as what I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:55,869
And without somewhat understanding of the "how", the "what" is almost irrelevant.

10
00:00:55,869 --> 00:01:00,237
So I kind of play them back and forth. So how would I build a thing that kind of does this?

11
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:06,036
And in fact the ideas for Gist started with, "If I want to do that, like, where would I get the list of people."

12
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:08,571
How would I do that? How would I prioritize that?

13
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:11,907
What should it do? Who does it do it for? Why is it valuable?

14
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:15,786
So it was both the idea, but the technical implementation and hacking around on that

15
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:23,536
I think is so critical, and that where it comes back to being technical and getting into how things work, mechanically or from a code perspective

16
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:27,788
I think most good software guys tend to think in 18-24 month cycles

17
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:31,571
Because normally if you are going to do a company and you fund a company

18
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:36,703
you have 18-24 month runway. So you kind of get into this model of like, what can I do in 18 months?

19
00:01:36,703 --> 00:01:44,436
And thats kind of a horizon. 18 months from now I'll probably have to raise more money, I'll probably need the business to looks like this

20
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:48,437
What is the next phase of the business look like? And what do I want to achieve with the business?

21
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:54,035
So, I think that first and foremost, you as an entrepreneur should say, what do I want to achieve in the business?

22
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:58,620
Now I'm gonna come very much back to the tactical, "What am I going to do next week? And the next 3 months?"

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,870
So, it was our way of thinking, "How do we get our interesting ideas to the largest amount of people at the fastest rate?"

24
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:12,005
I have sort of a construct that I use to sort of run through almost all of my ideas and now I can do them much more radpidly

25
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:16,770
And its really; customer, value proposition, feature set and business model.

26
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,786
And almost every idea I do now, I just go run through that. And if you take the construct a little further,

27
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:26,070
"What is the value I'm delivering?

28
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,169
So in my case it might be: A better understanding of another person.

29
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,454
Or saving time.

30
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:33,070
So my primary value to you is saving time and gaining deeper understanding.

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,954
So when I think about the business model I say, well, I should charge you more for more time I save you.

32
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:41,787
And thats a correlation between the value and the business model.

33
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:50,037
And so considering the business model alongside or in parallel with who's the customer, whats the features, I think is critical.

34
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:55,837
I have to say that in the things that I do, starting companies and working with different entrepreneurs,

35
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:59,902
I enjoy the process of building companies, as much as the companies themselves.

36
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:02,534
The whole process part is really exciting for me,

37
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:08,669
because if you do it well, if you have two companies that have the exact same idea, and one has a better process

38
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:10,952
you can do more features faster for less money

39
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:14,785
than the guy down the street. That ultimately ends up being the big advantage.

40
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,120
Ideas are easy. Execution is really hard.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,287
And people who can execute ideas more rapidly or with higher quality or with fewer people will ultimately outpace
