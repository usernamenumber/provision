1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,920
I now want to introduce you
really just to a different

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,330
notation for writing vectors,
and then we'll do that same

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,540
problem or a slight variation
on that problem

6
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,680
using the new notation.

7
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,760
This is just to expose you to
things, so that you don't get

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,830
confused if your teacher uses a
different notation than what

9
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,770
I've been doing.

10
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,090
So when we did the unit vectors,
we learned that we

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,550
can express a vector as a
component of its x- and

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,130
y-components.

13
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:30,270
So let's say I had a vector--
let me just pick a random

14
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,090
vector just to show you.

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,780
So say I had vector a and that
equals 2 times the unit vector

16
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,930
i plus 3 times the
unit vector j.

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,430
That's the unit vector notation,
and I actually

18
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,090
looked it up on Wikipedia, and
they actually called it the

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,060
engineering notation.

20
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,170
That's probably why I used it
because I am an engineer, or I

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,830
was an engineer before
managing money.

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,350
But another way to write this,
and I call this the bracket

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,770
notation, or the ordered pair
notation, is you could also

24
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,020
write it like this.

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,140
   

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,050
We have this one bracket.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,180
That's the x-component, that's
the y-component.

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,130
It almost looks like a
coordinate pair, but since

29
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,990
they have the brackets, you
know it's a vector.

30
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,290
But you would draw it
the exact same way.

31
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,570
So given that, let's do
that same problem

32
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,150
that we had just done.

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,660
Hopefully, this make
sense to you.

34
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,230
It's just a different
way of writing it.

35
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,170
Instead of an i and a j, you
just write these brackets.

36
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,611
Instead of a plus, you
write a comma.

37
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,120
Let me clear this.

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,230
I'm going to do a slight
variation.

39
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,140
This was actually the second
part of that problem.

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,560
My cousin gave these
problems to me.

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,890
They're pretty good, so I figure
I'd stick with them.

42
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,000
So in the old problem, let me
draw my coordinate axes again.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,885
   

44
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,370
That's the y-axis.

45
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,915
That's the x-axis.

46
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:53,670
   

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,740
So in the old problem, I started
off with a ball that

48
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,970
was 4 feet off the ground.

49
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,310
So let's say that's 4.

50
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:07,760
And I hit it at 120 feet per
second at a 30-degree angle.

51
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,710
So that's a 30-degree
angle like that.

52
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,332
   

53
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:17,170
Its' a 30-degree angle
to the horizontal.

54
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,580
And there's a fence 350 feet
away that's 30 feet high.

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,660
It's roughly around there.

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,020
That's 30.

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,845
And what we need to do is figure
out whether the ball

58
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:28,770
can clear the fence.

59
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,190
We figured out the last time
when we used the unit vector

60
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,430
notation that it doesn't
clear the fence.

61
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,180
But in this problem, or the
second part of this problem,

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,300
they said that there's
a 5 meter per second

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,340
wind gust to the right.

64
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,260
So there's a wind gust of 5
meters per second right when I

65
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,190
hit the ball.

66
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,305
And you could go into the
complications of how much does

67
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:49,620
that accelerate the ball?

68
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,410
Or what's the air resistance
of the ball?

69
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,410
I think for the simplicity of
the problem, they're just

70
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,670
saying that the x-component of
the ball's velocity right

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,370
after you hit it increases
by 5 meters per second.

72
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,540
I think that's their point.

73
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,690
So let's go back and do the
problem the exact same way

74
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,240
that we did it the last
time, but we'll

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,090
use a different notation.

76
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,750
So we can write that equation
that I had written before,

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,110
that the position at any given
time as a function of t is

78
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,870
equal to the initial position--
that's an i right

79
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,480
there-- plus the initial
velocity.

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,300
These are all vectors.

81
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:36,040
Initial velocity times t plus
the acceleration vector over

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,820
2t squared.

83
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,330
So what's the initial
position?

84
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,140
And now we're going to use
some of our new notation.

85
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,690
The initial position when I hit
the ball, its x-component

86
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,630
is 0, right?

87
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,130
It's almost like its coordinate,
and they're not

88
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,010
that different of a notation.

89
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,920
And then the y-position is 4.

90
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,510
Easy enough.

91
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,710
What's its initial velocity?

92
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,470
Let me do it.

93
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,810
So we can split it up into the
x- and the y-components.

94
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:18,420
The y-component is 120 sine of
30 degrees and then the x

95
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,240
component is 120 cosine
of 30 degrees.

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,410
That's just the x-component
after I hit it.

97
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,860
But then they say there's
this wind gust so it's

98
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,220
going to be plus 5.

99
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,020
I think that's their point when
they say that there's

100
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,130
this wind gust. They say that
right when you hit it, for

101
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,150
some reason in the x-direction,
it accelerates a

102
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,750
little bit by 5 meters
per second.

103
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,140
So the velocity vector.

104
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,140
This notation actually is
better, because it takes less

105
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,170
space up, and you don't have
all these i's and j's and

106
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,880
pluses confusing everything.

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,690
So the initial velocity
vector, what's its

108
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,690
x-component?

109
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,590
It's 120 cosine of 30.

110
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,310
Cosine of 30 is square root of
3/2 times 120 is 60 square

111
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,370
roots of 3, and then
you add 5 to it.

112
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,990
So what is that?

113
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,650
Let me just solve
it right now.

114
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:15,130
So 3 times the square root
of 3 times 60 plus 5.

115
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,730
So let's just round up
and make it easier.

116
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,315
It's 109 meters per second.

117
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:21,940
108.9, so let's just say 109.

118
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,010
So the x-component of
the velocity is 109.

119
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,030
And the y-component was just
120 times the sine of 30.

120
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,660
Well, sine of 30 is 1/2,
so this is 60.

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,050
Oh, sorry, this should be
brackets, although some people

122
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,060
actually write the parentheses
there so it looks just like

123
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,930
coordinates, but I like to keep
it with these brackets so

124
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,410
that you don't think that these
are coordinates since

125
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,750
you know these are vectors.

126
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,790
And a position vector is really
the same thing as a

127
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,600
position coordinate.

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,270
But a velocity vector is
obviously not a coordinate.

129
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,640
What's the acceleration
vector?

130
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,505
Well, the acceleration vector,
as we said, goes straight--

131
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,540
that's not straight down.

132
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,520
This is straight down at minus
32 feet per second squared.

133
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,880
That's the acceleration
of gravity on Earth.

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,785
So the acceleration vector
is equal to -- it has no

135
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:12,390
x-component and its y-component
is minus 32.

136
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,560
So now let's put these back
in that original equation.

137
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,650
So our position vector, and
I'll switch colors to keep

138
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,680
things from getting
monotonous.

139
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,320
Our position vector-- these are
little arrows or one-sided

140
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:33,040
arrows-- equals my initial
position, and that's 0, 4 plus

141
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:43,660
my initial velocity vector,
109, 60 times t, and I'm

142
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,640
running out of space, plus at
squared over two, so t squared

143
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:59,740
over 2 times my acceleration
vector, 0 minus 32.

144
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,350
This is actually a little
cleaner way of writing it, but

145
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,800
this is exactly what
we did when we did

146
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
it with unit vectors.

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,030
Instead of writing i's and j's,
we're just writing the

148
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,670
numbers in brackets here.

149
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,510
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

150
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,090
So let me write it in a
different color, so that you

151
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,440
know I'm doing.

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:26,060
OK, so our position vector t
is equal to 0, 4 plus-- and

153
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,680
now we can distribute this t,
multiply it times both of

154
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:40,990
these-- plus 109t, 60t plus--
and we can distribute this t

155
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,030
squared over 2.

156
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,970
Well, that times 0 is 0.

157
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:51,210
And then that times minus
32 is minus 16t squared.

158
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,540
Now we can add the vectors.

159
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,330
So the position at any t.

160
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,950
So let's add all the
x-components of the vectors.

161
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:06,720
0, 109t, 0, so we
just get 109t.

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,110
And then what's the
y-components?

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:23,320
4 plus 60t minus 16t squared.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,710
And there we go.

165
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,730
We've defined the position
vector at a

166
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,880
function of any time.

167
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,770
So let's solve the problem.

168
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,260
Now that they have this wind
gust and our x velocity's

169
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,380
going a little faster, let's see
if we can clear the fence.

170
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,610
So how long does it take to
get to 350 feet in the

171
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,450
x-direction?

172
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,159
Well, this number right
here has to equal 350.

173
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,480
So we have 109t has to
be equal to 350.

174
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,820
And so what's 350
divided by 109?

175
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:59,040
350 divided by 109 is equal
to 3.2 seconds.

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,070
t is equal to 3.2 seconds.

177
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,120
And so what's the height
at 3.2 seconds?

178
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,370
So let's square that.

179
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,740
   

180
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:21,235
3.2 times 3.2 equals times
16 equals 164.

181
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:25,000
So this equals 164.

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,546
And then what's 60 times 3.2?

183
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:33,680
60 times 3.2 is equal to 192.

184
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,090
So what do we get?

185
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:50,990
We get 192 plus 4 minus
164 is equal to 32.

186
00:09:50,990 --> 00:10:00,350
So our position vector at time
3.2 seconds is equal to 350

187
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:08,150
feet in the x-direction and 32
feet in the y-direction, and

188
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,970
that will clear that
30-foot fence.

189
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,860
Our ball's going to be two
feet above the fence.

190
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,390
Hope I didn't confuse
you too much.

191
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,980
See you soon.

192
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,000
