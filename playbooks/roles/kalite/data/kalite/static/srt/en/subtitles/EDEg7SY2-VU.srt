1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,480
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,970
So I did this ahead of time, so
as to not waste your time

4
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,775
drawing it.

5
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:08,560
The question says, a merchant
sells three types of clocks

6
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,500
that chime as indicated
by the check marks

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,890
in the table above.

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,610
What is the total number of
chimes of the inventory of

9
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,860
clocks in the 90-minute
period?

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:26,780
And we're talking about
7:15 to 8:45.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,405
So let's just make sure we
understand this chart.

12
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,700
So we have clocks of
type a, b, and c.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,730
This is the number of
each of those clocks

14
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,830
that the store has.

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,540
Now these n times on the nth
hour, that means when it turns

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,680
7 o'clock, it's going to
chime seven times.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,895
When it turns 8 o'clock, it's
going to chime eight times, et

18
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:47,190
cetera, et cetera.

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,200
This is once on the hour,
so right at the hour

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,150
does just one chime.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,785
And then these do once
on the half hour.

22
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:56,230
   

23
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:06,360
So let's see, we have
clock a times 10.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,880
And how many times is each of
the clock a's going to chime

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,570
between this period?

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:15,340
Well, it does n times
on the nth hour.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,780
So between 7:15 and 8:45,
there's only one hour that

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,660
happens, which is 8 o'clock.

29
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,220
And at 8 o'clock it's going
to chime n times.

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,965
It's going to chime eight
chimes at 8 o'clock.

31
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,470
   

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,730
And it also does one
on the half hour.

33
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,100
So what half hours are there?

34
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,230
Well there's 7:30 and there's
8:30 that pass up.

35
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,520
So there are two half hours.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,420
It's going to chime at 7:30
and 8:30, each of these.

37
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,910
So then plus 2, once at 7:30
and once at 8:30, times 10,

38
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,750
because there's ten clocks.

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,190
Let's see, b times 5 clocks,
n times on the nth hour.

40
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,660
Well, once again that's eight
chimes at 8:00, and it doesn't

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,639
do anything else.

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,419
So times 5.

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,260
And then finally c times
three clocks.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,380
It doesn't do this n
times the nth hour.

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,740
It does once on the hour.

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,880
It's going to do it
once at 8 o'clock.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,410
And then once on the half
hour, so plus 1 at

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,350
7:30 plus 1 at 8:30.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,550
So that's 3 times
three clocks.

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,070
So what's this?

51
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,180
It's 8 plus 2.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,110
Eight chimes plus two chimes.

53
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,190
So that's ten chimes per
clock times 10 is

54
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,360
equal to a 100 chimes.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,770
Eight chimes per clock
times five clocks

56
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,930
is equal to 40 chimes.

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,360
And then three chimes per clock
times three clocks is

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,010
equal to 9.

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,910
You add all this up together,
and the whole store in this

60
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,250
time period, if I haven't made
a mistake, will chime 149 or

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,850
there'll be 149 chimes of the
inventory of clocks in this

62
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,210
90-minute period.

63
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,460
Next question.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,070
   

65
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,440
So they draw a bunch
of random things.

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,300
I'll just replace them with
numbers because that's easier

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,020
for me to think, or letters
a, b, c, d, and e.

68
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,930
I mean those pictures
are useless.

69
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,410
They say, if the five cards
shown above are placed in a

70
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,320
row so that the shaded box, but
I'll call that c, so that

71
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,510
c is never at either end, how
many different arrangements

72
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,700
are possible?

73
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,250
Well, this is how I
think about it.

74
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,140
c is the most restricted.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,550
Let's say that we're placing
them in order.

76
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,790
Let's say these are the spots.

77
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,620
They're in a row.

78
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,560
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,870
And when we come along,
we have c.

80
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,660
We know that c can't be
placed here, and it

81
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,570
can't be placed here.

82
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,920
So it can only be placed in
one of these three spots.

83
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,480
So there's three possible
situations

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,000
where c can be placed.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,890
Let's say you place c in one
of these three spots.

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,280
Now it's our turn to place a.

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,880
How many spots are
left to place a?

88
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,550
Well, one of these three is
going to be taken by c.

89
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,820
But then a can be in any
of the other four.

90
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,720
So then there's four
possibilities for a.

91
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,840
And then once you place a, then
for b, well two of the

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,650
spots are going to be
taken up in b, so

93
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,850
there's three spots left.

94
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,380
So there's three possibilities
for b.

95
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,990
And then there's only
two openings for d.

96
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,220
And then there's
only one for e.

97
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,100
So if you multiply this out,
you get 3 times 4 is 12.

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,910
12 times 3 is 36.

99
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,700
36 times 2 is 72.

100
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,480
So there are 72 possible
arrangements where the middle

101
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,470
card or that grey card is never
placed at either end.

102
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,220
That's how I always think about
these because you just

103
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,250
think about placing them-- well
this first one can only

104
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,560
go in three-- well
you get the idea.

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,570
Hopefully you get the idea.

106
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,510
Well, that's this section,
so I will see

107
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,160
you in the next section.

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,410
Have fun.

109
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:28,600
