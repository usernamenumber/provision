1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,810
Let's try to construct a
situation where I participate

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,320
in the new Treasury Public
Private Program.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,510
And I get all of the upside
I would have gotten in a

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,840
traditional just straight up
investment in these toxic

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,570
securities.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,360
But then I'm able to offload
some of the downside.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,100
And so just as a review, what
the program entails is that if

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,130
I want to make an investment
in something.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,689
Let's say I want to make a
$100 or 100% investment.

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,130
It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,810
Either way.

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,140
That's 100.

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,250
The Fed is going to give us
a loan for 85% of it.

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,900
And then the remainder, the
equity, is going to be split

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,960
half, or 50-50, between myself
and the Treasury.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
And then this is the
private investor.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,120
So what happens here?

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,430
And we talked a lot about it in
the last couple of videos.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,240
Is that the upside, if this
thing is worth more than 100,

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,990
it's split between the Treasury

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,370
and the private investor.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,980
And then the downside is split
between the private investor

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,720
and the Treasury.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,220
Until the asset becomes
worth less than 85% of

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,020
its original value.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,550
And then the Fed takes
the hit, right?

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,320
Because this loan won't
be worth anything.

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,820
And all this loan can go
after is this asset.

30
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,560
It's a non recourse loan.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,270
The Fed can't say, oh, this
thing is only worth 84.

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,630
Private investor and Treasury,
you guys owe me a dollar.

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,250
The Fed is just left with this
asset that might be worth

34
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,390
something less than that.

35
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,300
But how could we use this
program to get the same upside

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,030
we would have otherwise gotten,
if we had just bought

37
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,530
the toxic security outright?

38
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:43,970
So let's say that the toxic
security, in a before-this

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,570
program world that Geithner
has come up with.

40
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,130
Let's say that I'm willing to
pay $30 for a security.

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,360
And obviously if the security
is worth $40, I'll make $10.

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,490
If it's worth $50,
I'll make $20.

43
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,480
And so forth and so on.

44
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,610
That's obvious.

45
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,110
Now what I can do is, instead
of just, with this plan-- I

46
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,640
mean, before I would have to
take my $30 that I have in the

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,880
bank, and use it to buy some
asset, if one of these banks

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,589
were willing to sell it to me.

49
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,550
But what I can do now is, I
could say, well, let me just

50
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,450
take 15% of this.

51
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,390
So what's 15% of $30?

52
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,210
It's $4.50.

53
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,420
And use that to invest
in this program.

54
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,250
And essentially get the same
upside as I would if I

55
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,690
invested the whole $30.

56
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,800
And then put the rest of the
cash away essentially safe, so

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,140
that my worst case is that I
just lose what I invest. So

58
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,080
let's do that.

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,780
And we'll see that the numbers
do all work out.

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,860
So instead of just doing $30
all for the investment, I'm

61
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,020
going to set aside 15%.

62
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,820
So I'm going to put $4.50 to
participate in the plan.

63
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,900
And then I'm going to set
aside what's left.

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,190
$25.50 in cash.

65
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,840
And using this $4.50 in the
plan, I'll show you that I'll

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,610
get all of the upside that I got
if I had originally had to

67
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,790
use all $30 by myself.

68
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,370
And obviously my downside
is limited.

69
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,925
My downside is limited to the
$4.50, because I'm still going

70
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,730
to have the $25.50 in
cash on the side.

71
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,760
So how is this going to work?

72
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,660
I'm going to put in $4.50.

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,200
That's from me, the
private investor.

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,140
The Treasury is going to
match my investment.

75
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,310
$4.50.

76
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,560
That's the Treasury.

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,990
   

78
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,550
Now I have $9 of equity.

79
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,040
And this is going to be 15% of
the total equity, so the debt

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,610
that the Fed will lend me
is going to be $51.

81
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,580
And I did the math before I did
the video, but you could

82
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,880
work it out yourself.

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,100
$51 loan from the Fed.

84
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,190
And so what's our total capital
that we've raised now?

85
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,320
So if you add $51 plus
$9, we have $60.

86
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,150
Let me do this in a
different color.

87
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,600
We now have $60.

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,230
And we could use that $60.

89
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,640
If someone was willing to sell
me one, I guess we could say

90
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,520
one of the units, or one of the
securities for $30, now

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,570
with $60, we can buy
two of the units.

92
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,420
So we could buy two
of them for $30.

93
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,750
And why did I end up making the
math work so we'd get two

94
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,770
securities?

95
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,020
Because we split the
upside, right?

96
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,090
We split the upside
with the Treasury.

97
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,800
So in order to set up a
situation where I get all of

98
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,140
the upside that I would have
gotten with a $30 security, I

99
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,820
essentially have to set up a
configuration where we buy

100
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,270
twice as many securities.

101
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,840
I buy twice as many securities,
and then I split

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,415
the upside 50-50 with the
Treasury, then I'm just going

103
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,230
to get the upside.

104
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,750
You could almost view
it on one security.

105
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,770
Let's see how the math
works out now.

106
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,050
Let's do a bunch of scenarios.

107
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:06,060
So in the world where-- maybe
I should do a table.

108
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,910
Yeah, let's say that the
eventual value of the

109
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,930
security, let's say it's worth--
I'm going to make a

110
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,020
bunch of numbers up.

111
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:25,140
0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

112
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,050
That's good enough.

113
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,000
So let's say that these
securities end

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,200
up being worth nothing.

115
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,050
How much am I left with?

116
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,670
What's the total value of
my total investment?

117
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,100
Well if these are worth
nothing, then I

118
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,860
get wiped out here.

119
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,860
We all get wiped out here.

120
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,510
In fact, everyone gets
wiped out here.

121
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,140
So how much did I lose?

122
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,760
Well my $4.50 is gone.

123
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,660
This goes to 0.

124
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,160
But what is my total investment
left with?

125
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,590
I still have my $25.50 that
I put to the side, right?

126
00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:01,650
So I still have my
$25.50 in cash.

127
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,750
If each of these securities
are worth $10, this is

128
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,680
eventual value of each
of the units.

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,440
So if each of these is worth
$10, then the whole asset side

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,760
of this balance sheet is worth
$20, and once again, the Fed

131
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,570
is going to take a $31 hit.

132
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,850
And these two guys
are wiped out.

133
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,720
So my investment is
worth nothing.

134
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,130
But I still have that money
I set aside in the bank.

135
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,750
$25.50.

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,480
If these securities are worth
$20, then this whole asset

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,785
side is worth $40, because
there's going

138
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:32,980
to be two of them.

139
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,240
The Fed is still taking a hit.

140
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,370
Doesn't get all its
money back.

141
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,010
And these two guys still
get wiped out.

142
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,100
My $4.50 is gone.

143
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,120
I still have my money
in my bank. $25.50.

144
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,850
If this security is worth $30,
which is essentially the price

145
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,150
that we're paying for it.

146
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,850
Then this is what the balance
sheet is going to look like.

147
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,710
So my equity is worth $4.50.

148
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,720
But I have $4.50 plus
the money that I

149
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,530
had set aside, right?

150
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,070
I have $4.50 plus this
$25.50 that I'd put

151
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,280
aside in the bank.

152
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,610
Because I didn't have
to invest that.

153
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,600
I just had to invest the
$4.50 initially.

154
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,960
So I have my $4.50 here,
plus $25.50.

155
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,510
So the value of all of my
investments is $30.

156
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:12,780
What

157
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,650
Happens if each of these
units are worth $40.

158
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,110
If each of these are worth $40,
then we have $80 on the

159
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,600
left-hand side of the
balance sheet.

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,170
So let me draw that
really small here.

161
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,310
So then we'll have two units
that are worth $40.

162
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,190
That's $80.

163
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,190
We owe $51 to the Fed.

164
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,920
So we're going to have $29
to split between the

165
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,170
Treasury and ourselves.

166
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,190
   

167
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,420
$29 divided by 2 is $14.50.

168
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,600
We're each going to
split that $29.

169
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,290
So my equity is now
worth $14.50.

170
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,500
So my total investment is going
to be the cash that I

171
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,910
put aside-- so that's,
let's say, $25.50.

172
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,200
Plus the value of my equity
investment now.

173
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,660
So that's plus $14.50.

174
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,340
And so it's worth $40.

175
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,760
I think you see the
pattern here.

176
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,320
In all of these kind of downside
scenarios, the most I

177
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,600
lost was $4.50.

178
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,660
And now in all of these upside
scenarios, we're going to see

179
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,790
that I get the value of
the actual security.

180
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,450
Now let's do it for $50, but I
think you know how the math's

181
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,480
going to work out.

182
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,950
If each of these ends up being
worth $50, then this whole

183
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,700
left-hand side is $100.

184
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,440
We owe the Fed $51.

185
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,309
So this is going to be $49.

186
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,700
And if you split that,
it's $24.50.

187
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,450
The money we set aside in
the bank is $25.50.

188
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,700
And so this is worth $50.

189
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,460
And, likewise, if these are each
worth $60, this is going

190
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,190
to turn out to be $60.

191
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,240
So what you see here,
and I'm going to

192
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,490
draw a payoff diagram.

193
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,662
   

194
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,440
Let me draw a line here.

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:11,200
   

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,030
Let's see if I can
do this right.

197
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:20,300
So if this is the eventual
value of the asset.

198
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,280
When we pay something in the
market, we're hoping we're

199
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,250
buying it for less than its
real value, but we really

200
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,910
don't know 100% what the
eventual value is.

201
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,100
But this x-axis is the
eventual value.

202
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,580
   

203
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:42,270
So it could be 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, and

204
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,640
so on and so forth.

205
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,060
So depending on this eventual
value, what is the value of my

206
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,270
investment?

207
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,880
So we figured out if it's 0, 10,
20, all the way really up

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:02,850
to-- The value of my investment
is going to be-- I

209
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,400
didn't have to draw this stuff
down here-- let's say that

210
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,420
this is $24.50.

211
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:18,580
So in all of these scenarios--
whoops, trying to draw a

212
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:29,310
line-- so 20, and
then at $25.50.

213
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,780
If this thing is worth--
We could figure out the

214
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,640
break-even, right?

215
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,460
If these assets are worth
anything more combined than

216
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,750
$51, then we start to have
value to the equity.

217
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,080
So what's that value?

218
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,560
That's this divided
by 2 is $25.50.

219
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,860
So after $25.50 some value
starts going to the equity.

220
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,550
And we know at $30-- let me draw
those points, actually.

221
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,200
I'll do it in a different color
when we're in the money.

222
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,660
So at $30, the value of
our security is 30.

223
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,820
At $40, the value of
our security is 40.

224
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,990
And so on and so forth.

225
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,345
And let me draw a line now.

226
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:14,880
   

227
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,422
That's not what I
wanted to do.

228
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,960
I'll just draw a regular line.

229
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,120
Our payoff would look
something like this.

230
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,920
This is a good visualization
for what the

231
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,850
government is giving us.

232
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,790
And I'll show you that what
they're giving us is

233
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,010
essentially insurance, or
a put option for free.

234
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,820
And then we can talk in the
next video about how

235
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,870
we can value it.

236
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,800
And then we have a real sense
of what the government is

237
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,530
handing over to the investor.

238
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,360
Now, you might say that it's
handing it to the investor,

239
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,750
but if because of this the
investor overpays for the

240
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,990
asset, that subsidy is
really going to the

241
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,270
person selling the asset.

242
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,420
And we'll talk about
that a little bit

243
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,220
more in the next video.

244
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,520
But let me just finish
this up a little bit.

245
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,660
So we said that the point
at which we start

246
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,690
making money is here.

247
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,370
Because this is what we
paid for the security.

248
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,090
We're paying $30 for
the security.

249
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,690
So these are all the scenarios
where we start making money.

250
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,040
Where the security's worth
more than that.

251
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,010
But the equity's actually worth
something above $25.50,

252
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,730
but we're still taking
a slight loss.

253
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,230
But the cool thing is, if we are
the private investor here,

254
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,580
even if the thing is worth very
little, we don't take

255
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,250
that much of a loss here.

256
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,050
And this is much better.

257
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,430
What would the payoff diagram
have looked like if we were

258
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,330
just a straight-up investor?

259
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,930
Let me just draw that in
a different color.

260
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,870
Well then it would've looked
something like this.

261
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,363
We would have had
the same upside.

262
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:45,130
   

263
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,920
But our downside would've
gone all the way to 0.

264
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,240
If the asset is worth 0, we
would have been worth-- well,

265
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,006
these lines were supposed to
be on top of each other.

266
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,260
But I think you get the idea
that the government is saving

267
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,800
us from these losses
right here.

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,705
Oh, I think you can't see it.

269
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:02,430
I'm off the screen.

270
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,240
The government's saving us from
these losses right there.

271
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,700
And so I'm out of time
in this video.

272
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,190
In the next video, I'm going to
actually analyze what that

273
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,850
subsidy or what that insurance
or that option that the

274
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,990
government is giving us,
what it might be worth.

275
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,370
And then we could think about
whether now people are willing

276
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,040
to actually overpay
for these things.

277
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,910
See you in the next video.

278
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,935
