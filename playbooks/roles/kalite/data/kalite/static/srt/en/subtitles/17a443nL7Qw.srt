1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,400
Solve for x plus 8 is less than or equal to 6 and graph the solution

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,000
So we have x plus 8 is less than or equal to 6

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So let's solve this inequality for x, and the easiest way to isolate an x on, let's isolate on the left

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
hand side since it's already there is to just get rid of this 8,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,267
and the best way to get rid of this positive 8 is to subtract 8 from both sides

6
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:29,975
So let's subtract 8 from both sides, that won't change the

7
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:33,800
direction of the inequality, so the left hand side

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,600
x plus 8 minus 8, you're just left with an x,

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,467
the right hand side 6 minus 8 is negative 2, and we still have the less than or equal

10
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,133
So we solve the inequality, we have x is less than or equal to

11
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,133
negative 2, so let's draw that on a number line.

12
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:53,533
So that's my number line, let's take 0 over here, maybe if

13
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:59,400
we go 1, then we can go negative 1, negative 2, negative 3

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,867
and we can keep going to the left, and we want

15
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:05,467
all the x's that are less than or equal to negative 2

16
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:10,867
since it can be equal to negative 2, we'll put a filled in

17
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:15,067
line right here at negative 2, and all of the values less than that

18
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,800
If it was just less than, if there wasn't the equal sign, we would have an open dot

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,133
but since this is less than OR equal to, we've closed this dot

20
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:25,400
Then we want all of the values below that

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,933
And you can just sample a few and verify for yourself that they work,

22
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,200
Based on this, negative 3 should work, and if you took

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,200
negative 3, negative 3 plus 8 is five, which is definitely

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,800
less than 6, so that works, and negative 1 shouldn't work,

25
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,533
it's not included in this set over here, so let's try that out.

26
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:51,400
Negative 1 plus 8 is 7, which is definitely not less than 6,

27
00:01:51,400 --> 99:59:59,999
so just sampling some points, it seems like we've got the right solution.
