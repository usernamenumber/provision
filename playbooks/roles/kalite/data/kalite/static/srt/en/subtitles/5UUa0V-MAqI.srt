1
00:00:00,513 --> 00:00:04,159
In my attempt to have a portfolio whose performance should depend

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:07,608
only on my ability to identify good companies and to

3
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:13,197
identify bad companies and not be held sway by whatever the market might do

4
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:18,089
I have bought a share of company B thinking that it's a pretty good company

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,064
that'll do better than expected and I shorted two shares of

6
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:25,131
company A and I shorted two of them because they're only 5 dollars a share

7
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,762
and I wanted to short the same dollar amount

8
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:31,471
So now I want to think about, assuming that I was right.

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,054
That company B will do better than company A relative to each other

10
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:40,888
How my investment will do if the stock market moves up or if the stock market moves down?

11
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,969
So let's imagine a situation where the stock market moves up.

12
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,721
And that situation you can imagine both of these stocks will go up.

13
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:52,485
So let's say company B goes up in percentage terms more than

14
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:57,765
Company A. So let's say that company B gets to 15 dollars.

15
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:02,269
So it gets to 15 dollars a share so it is up 50%

16
00:01:02,269 --> 00:01:06,786
And let's say that company A only goes up by 20% so it goes to

17
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:12,336
6 dollars a share. So company A only goes up by 20%

18
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:17,118
Up 20%. So it is now up to 6 dollars a share.

19
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,885
So in that situation what happened? I clearly make a lot of money on company B

20
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:26,432
on my long position when the stock market goes up and

21
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:31,419
10 dollars became 15 dollars so I made 5 dollars there

22
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:34,854
And I clearly lost money on my short position.

23
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:40,564
Because I sold it at 5 and now I'm going to have to buy it back at 6

24
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:45,169
If I want to cover my short position. So this 10 dollar position

25
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,782
remember I have 2 of shares of them, are now worth 12 dollars

26
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:52,104
are now worth 12 dollars. 2 times 6 dollars.

27
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:57,203
And since this is a short postion I will lose 2 dollars

28
00:01:57,203 --> 00:02:01,063
But because the company that I thought would do better

29
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:04,049
did do better it went up by more; It went up by 50 percent

30
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,370
while this only went up by 20 percent I still make money. I still make a 3 dollar profit.

31
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,469
Now let's think about what happens if the whole stock market

32
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:19,247
goes down. And I'm going to assume that I'm good at picking the right companies

33
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:23,914
so I assume that my thesis holds: that B does better relative to A.

34
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:28,923
So let's say in this negative scenario B goes down by 20 percent

35
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:33,935
So let's say B goes down by 20% So down by 20 percent

36
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:40,892
So it gets to 8 dollars a share. It gets to 8 dollars a share

37
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:48,210
So this is the market up scenario. Now let's imagine the market down scenario

38
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,730
Market down.

39
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,251
So now my position in B goes from 10 dollars

40
00:02:55,251 --> 00:03:05,521
to 8 eight dollars so I lose 2 dollars on my long position

41
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:10,721
But when the market went down, I was right, A is not that great of a company

42
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:15,756
so it goes down more. Let's imagine that it goes down by 50 percent.

43
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:20,734
So A goes down by 50 percent. Down by 50 percent.

44
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:26,621
All the way to 2.50 per share. So now it's at 2.50 per share.

45
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:31,018
So my position in A the short position that was 10 dollars

46
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:35,767
It is now a 5 dollar short position. 2 shares at 2.50 per share.

47
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:40,084
So this is a short position I sold the stock that I borrowed and sold it at 10

48
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:47,052
now I can buy it back at 5, I make 5 dollars on the short position when the market goes down.

49
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:53,071
So even though I lost some money on my long position when the market goes down I more than make up

50
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:57,581
for it on my short position. So even in the down market, assuming my stock picking

51
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,087
is good, I have still made, I have still made 3 dollars.

52
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:06,417
And so what we've set up here is the long-short hedge and what's cool about it is

53
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:11,040
it's only dependent on the investor's hability to differentiate

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,448
the companies that are more or less likely to do well

55
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:18,265
relative to other companies and it's not as dependent on someone's

56
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:21,934
ability to pick which direction the market itself will be going.

57
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,493
And so when people talk about long-short hedge funds

58
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,380
they're talking about hedge funds that are essentially doing this

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,367
They're trying to hedge out the market risk.
