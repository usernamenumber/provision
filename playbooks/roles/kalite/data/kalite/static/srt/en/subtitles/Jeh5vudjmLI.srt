1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,099
Plot (4,-1) and select the quadrant in which the point lies.

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,117
So 4, the first number in our ordered pair, that's our x coordinate.

3
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:15,157
That says how far to move in the horizontal or the x direction

4
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:18,164
It's a positive 4 so I'm going to go 4 to the right

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,996
and then the second coordinate says what we will do in the vertical direction or in the y direction.

6
00:00:22,996 --> 00:00:25,783
It's a negative one so since it's negative we'll going go down

7
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:29,274
and it's a negative one so we'll going go down one.

8
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:32,971
So that right over there is the point (4,-1)

9
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,845
So I've plotted it, but now I have to select which quadrant the point lies in

10
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,606
and this is just a naming convention.

11
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,028
This is the first quadrant.

12
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,805
This is the second quadrant.

13
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,027
This is the third quadrant,

14
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:45,603
and this is the fourth quadrant.

15
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:48,138
So the point lies in the fourth quadrant.

16
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,071
Quadrant IV

17
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:53,142
and I guess you have to know your Roman Numerals a little bit to know that--

18
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:56,213
--that's representing Quadrant IV.

19
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,284
Let's do a couple more of these.

20
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,899
Plot (8,-4) and select the quadrant in which the point lies.

21
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:09,489
Well my x coordinate is 8 so I move 8 or I go 8 in the positive x direction.

22
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:14,531
And then my y is -4 so I go 4 down,

23
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:21,171
and this is sitting again in, not the first, not the second, not the third, but the fourth quadrant.

24
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,078
In Quadrant IV.

25
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:24,101
Let's do one more of these.

26
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,662
Hopefully we get a different quadrant.

27
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:28,474
So we want to plot the point (-5,5)

28
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:31,428
So now my x coordinate is negative, it's negative 5.

29
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:34,541
So I'm going to move to the left in the x direction.

30
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,087
So I go to negative 5,

31
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:40,222
and my y coordinate is positive so I go up 5.

32
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:44,102
So (-5,5)

33
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:47,470
and this is sitting not in the first quadrant, but the second quadrant,

34
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,416
and of course this is the third and fourth.

35
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:53,416
So this is sitting in the second quadrant, which I answer and we got it right.
