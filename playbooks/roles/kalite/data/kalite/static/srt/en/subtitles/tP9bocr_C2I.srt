1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,610
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,630
Well today is what I hope is an

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,740
exciting day at Khan Academy.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,860
We're going to start a new set of, I guess we could call

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,000
them, lectures.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,780
But what we're going to do is I'm actually going to work

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,670
through just a bunch of SAT
problems. So what this is

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,850
going to be is like SAT prep for
free, or Princeton Review

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,380
or Kaplan for free, and I hope
neither of them sue me for

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,170
using their names.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,320
But anyway, what I want you to
do is, if you haven't already,

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,330
I want you to buy this
book right here.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,330
The Official SAT Study Guide.

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,526
Let me make sure it all fits
into the-- you'll see it in

15
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,980
the bookstore.

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,210
I hope I'm not doing any kind
of copyright infringement.

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:39,850
I'm not a lawyer.

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,050
I don't know all the rules.

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,610
But I'm pretty sure as long as
I give them credit and that

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,460
you know that all the problems
we're going to be doing are

21
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,490
from their book and I'm just
going to work through them,

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,770
hopefully that shouldn't be
something that's wrong.

23
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,800
Every day-- well not every
day, but as often as

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,730
possible-- I'm going to work
through all of the problems in

25
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,130
each of the math sections.

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,530
So the best thing for you to do
is for the same section, do

27
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,560
them ahead of time for yourself,
try to do as many as

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,090
you can, score your test, and
then whichever problems you

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,550
don't know, you can just watch
on Khan Academy and hopefully

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,810
understand them or re-understand
them.

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,170
So with that said, let's
get started.

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,930
So I'm using this
book right here.

33
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:26,830
Official SAT Study Guide, and
I am starting on page 395.

34
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,850
This is section three,
I believe, of

35
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,550
the first math section.

36
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,240
This is page 395.

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,330
So sometimes I'll
write the whole

38
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,160
problem, sometimes I won't.

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to assume that
you have the textbook.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,920
So with that said let's begin.

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:55,150
So the first problem, problem
number one, it says, if 2x

42
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:07,610
plus 3 is equal to 9, then
what is 4x minus 3.

43
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,130
Well this is just a very
basic algebra problem.

44
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,210
If you don't remember how to
do this you should probably

45
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,640
review the level one and level
two linear equations lectures

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,110
that I have in the
algebra playlist.

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,180
But the way we do this, we could
solve for x here, so we

48
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,540
can just subtract 3
from both sides.

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,920
2x plus 3 minus 3, so you get
a 0 here is equal to 6.

50
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,900
And x is equal to 3.

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,610
So if you do 4x minus 3, that's
4 times 3 minus 3.

52
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,790
Right, that's 12 minus 3.

53
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,660
And that also equals 9.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,050
And there are some, you could
have kind of done this a

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:54,840
little bit faster.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
But this is the one way that you
would make sure that you

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,190
got the right answer.

58
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,840
And on this test it's B, 9.

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,090
Number two.

60
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,660
There are 8 sections of seats
in an auditorium.

61
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,670
So I will write-- let me do it
in another color just keep

62
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,200
things interesting--
8 sections.

63
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,170
There are 8 sections of seats
in an auditorium.

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,200
Each section contains
150 seats, but no

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,100
more than 250 seats.

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,970
So if we say S is seats.

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,410
Let me say S is seats.

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:46,280
Seats are greater than or equal
to 150 and less than or

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,760
equal to 200.

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,822
This is seats per section.

71
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,900
I hope I'm not confusing you.

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,290
Which of the following could be
the number of seats in this

73
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,370
auditorium.

74
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,910
So before I even look at the
choices, I mean you could put

75
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,020
in the choices, you just have to
figure out, well what's the

76
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,060
minimum number of seats
in this auditorium?

77
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,340
Well the minimum number
is if every section

78
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,420
only has 150 seats.

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,760
So the minimum number is 8 times
150, 8 sections each of

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,209
them having 150 seats.

81
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,490
Because this is the case in
which every section has the

82
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,480
smallest number of seats.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:32,940
So 150 times 8-- 0, 40.

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,280
1 times 8 is 8 plus 4 is 12.

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,930
So this is the minimum number
of seats in the auditorium.

86
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,260
And then the maximum number
would be if we assume every

87
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,490
section had the maximum
number of seats.

88
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,190
So that would be 200 times 8.

89
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,700
That's easy.

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,400
2 times 8 is 1,600.

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,130
So we know that seats is going
to be greater than or equal to

92
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,970
this and less than
or equal to this.

93
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,910
And what choice falls
under that range?

94
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,870
Choice A doesn't, it's 800.

95
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,050
Choice B doesn't, choice
C doesn't.

96
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,140
Choice D, 1,300, does fit in
that range, and we know that

97
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,570
choice E doesn't fit
in that range.

98
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,520
So we're done.

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,730
It's D, 1,300 seats
is a possibility.

100
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,610
And we turn the page and
we a graphical problem.

101
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,020
Let's see what we could
do with this.

102
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,920
Note: Figure not drawn to scale
in the figure above.

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,060
Let me draw this.

104
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,900
I think I'll have to explain
how it's done.

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,640
I will use sky blue.

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,300
So the figures-- let
me draw that line.

107
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,310
No, let me do it better
than that.

108
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,850
Draw a thicker line than
that so you can see it.

109
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,110
So they have a line like that.

110
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,860
And they have another
line that goes up

111
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,110
and down like that.

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,470
And then they had a bunch
of points, so let

113
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,720
me draw those points.

114
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,900
I will draw them in
a different color.

115
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:47,160
So we have point A, point B,
point C, point D, point E.

116
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,920
And they call this horizontal
line, they're

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,080
calling this line L.

118
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,740
And then no, they have another
point up here.

119
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,570
Point X.

120
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,740
In the figure above XC is
perpendicular to L.

121
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,740
So this XC is perpendicular
to line L.

122
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,100
So we know that this is
a 90 degree angle.

123
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,900
And I think they draw it.

124
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,610
Yes, they draw that.

125
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,950
Which of the following
line segments has

126
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,690
the greatest length?

127
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,870
Oh, and in the figure they also
tell you the measurements

128
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,260
of the different lengths.

129
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,890
So they say from A to B is 3.

130
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,980
From B to C is 2.

131
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,020
C to D is 3.

132
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,970
D to E is 1.

133
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,930
And from C to X is 8.

134
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,760
Which of the following line
segments that are not shown

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,620
has the greatest length?

136
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,710
So the first choice--
I'll write the

137
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,220
choices down actually.

138
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,060
Choice A is line segment XA.

139
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,780
Choice B is line segment XB.

140
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,090
Well this is following
a pattern.

141
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,210
Choice C is line segment XC.

142
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,110
Choice D is line segment XD,
and then choice E is line

143
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,360
segment XE.

144
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,490
So which of the following
segments has

145
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,870
the greatest length?

146
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,370
So just eye-balling it, you'll
know that XB is definitely

147
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,050
going to be shorter.

148
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:29,090
XB is definitely going to
be shorter than XA.

149
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,950
Why is that?

150
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,600
Because if you used--
well one, you could

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,390
just eye-ball it.

152
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,360
I know it's not drawn
to scale.

153
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,809
But you definitely know that
this length, this base, is

154
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,409
longer than this base
right here.

155
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,200
So we know it's not
going to be XB.

156
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,170
We know XB is shorter
than definitely XA.

157
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,750
So we can cross that
one out, right?

158
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,330
Now what we don't know-- and we
could do the same thing on

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,620
the other side of this
perpendicular line.

160
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,100
We know that XD is shorter
than XE, right?

161
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,920
Same reason, because we know
this base is longer.

162
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
If you use a Pythagorean
theorem, you would know that

163
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,000
this hypotenuse is going to
be longer than this one.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,190
And you can review Pythagorean
theorem and get familiar with

165
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,190
the triangles if that doesn't
make a lot of sense.

166
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,790
But that tells us that it's
definitely not going to be XD.

167
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,260
And we also know it's
not going to be XC.

168
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,970
This is the shortest
of all of them.

169
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,740
And you could eye-ball that.

170
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,160
So it's either going
to be XE or XA.

171
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
And the way we figure out
which one has the longer

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,620
hypotenuse is we say, well they
all have the same height,

173
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,720
so which one has the
longer base?

174
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,730
So this one has a base, this
triangle right here-- if we

175
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,910
say this triangle-- has a base
of 4, and this triangle here

176
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,880
has a base of 5.

177
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,990
So this hypotenuse will be the
longest. XA is the answer.

178
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,510
I will see you in
the next video.
