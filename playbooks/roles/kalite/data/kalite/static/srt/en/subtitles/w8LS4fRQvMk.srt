1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,920
In the last video, we saw that
amines are actually reasonably

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,090
decent nucleophiles.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,420
And, in particular, we saw some
ethylamine attack some

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,320
bromoethane in an
Sn2 reaction.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,500
And right after that happened,
we had some diethylammonium

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,890
because the nitrogen had given
away an electron to this

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,460
carbon right over here.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,120
So it had a positive charge.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,530
And so you had diethylammonium
bromide.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,730
The bromine had left,
taking an electron.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,300
It then had a negative charge.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,630
And then we said that that
could actually be in

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,740
equilibrium, where another
ethylamine goes and takes a

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,790
hydrogen from the
diethylammonium and turns that

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,020
into diethylamine.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,240
So we essentially had a primary
amine turn into, or I

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,620
guess you could say, converted
into a secondary amine.

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,270
Now, the one thing that might
have popped into your brain

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,450
near the end of that video is,
hey, isn't this also a good

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,700
nucleophile?

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:05,590
   

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,370
And you say look, it's
got this lone pair.

24
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,140
It's more electronegative
than the things

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,090
that it's bonded with.

26
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,220
Maybe this too could do a
nucleophile attack or maybe

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,310
some type of an Sn2 reaction.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,060
And you would be correct.

29
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,120
So you could imagine, if you
have some more bromoethane

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,420
hanging around-- let me draw
some more bromoethane.

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,160
   

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,820
So let me draw it like this.

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,750
So this is our bromo group.

34
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,740
And then let's say we have a
hydrogen above like that.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,600
That's kind of upside down
from the last one we

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,690
did, but same idea.

37
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,390
Then we have another hydrogen
behind, just like that.

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,140
And this is obviously
a carbon.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,010
You could imagine that now you
have this diethylamine.

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,660
It can have an Sn2 reaction
with the bromoethane.

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,810
So before it was just
the ethylamine.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,960
Now it's the diethylamine
that's acting as a

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,250
nucleophile.

44
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:08,370
So this electron right here in
yellow could be given to this

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:15,780
carbon right at the same time
that this bromine leaves and

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,800
takes that electron.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,400
And the bromine already had one,
two, three, four, five,

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,250
six, seven valence electrons.

49
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,640
And this is really almost
identical to what happened in

50
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,360
the previous video, except now
we are starting with a

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,700
secondary amine, and we're going
to see it's going to

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,180
turn into a tertiary amine, as
opposed to the last one, where

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,820
we started with a primary
amine and turned into a

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,830
secondary amine.

55
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,640
So what's this going
to look like after

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,100
we've done the attack?

57
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,120
So the bromine will have left.

58
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,170
It's now the bromide anion.

59
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,970
So now we have the
bromide anion.

60
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,790
It has its seven original
valence electrons and now it

61
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,200
took one more electron
from the carbon.

62
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,790
   

63
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,140
It now has a negative charge.

64
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,040
And now this ethane group right
here-- so this carbon

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,950
right here is this carbon right
over here-- is now going

66
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,260
to be attached-- let me
draw it this way.

67
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,010
It's now going to be attached
to this nitrogen.

68
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,420
So this yellow electron is now
attached to that carbon, and

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,950
it's bonded to that green
electron, which on the

70
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,250
nitrogen or that the
nitrogen has.

71
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,670
And then this nitrogen has two
other ethyl groups attached to

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,230
it, one, two, and then it also
has this hydrogen over here.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,950
And because this nitrogen gave
away an electron, it now has a

74
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,360
positive charge.

75
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,740
And I didn't draw these two
hydrogens here on this carbon;

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,250
they're implicit.

77
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,070
I could draw them.

78
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,190
One hydrogen, one hydrogen,
and then another hydrogen.

79
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,020
But just to keep things simple,
I'm going to leave it

80
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,210
off, just so it becomes
very clear

81
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,000
that we now have triethyl.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,900
Let me make this clear.

83
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,720
So we have one, two three
ethyl groups.

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,060
So now this is triethyl
and it's a

85
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,550
positively charged nitrogen.

86
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,480
It's bonded to four things.

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,290
And essentially, it has given
away an electron, so this is

88
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,540
triethylammonium.

89
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,760
   

90
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,650
And if you view it as being
an ionic compound with the

91
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,550
bromide, then you would call
this triethylammonium bromide,

92
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,650
which this would be the salt
version, the ionic compound

93
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:46,990
right there.

94
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,920
But we have our
triethylammonium, and then you

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,240
could imagine, we had
that ethylamine

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
floating around before.

97
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,080
If you still have enough of
that ethylamine floating

98
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,420
around-- so let me draw some
of that ethylamine.

99
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,680
Ethylamine looks like this.

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,800
It has two hydrogens.

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,425
It has a lone pair.

102
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:08,070
It has a slightly partially
negative charge right here.

103
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,390
Nitrogen is very
electronegative.

104
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,640
It's the most basic of the
neutral functional groups that

105
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,450
we've studied.

106
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,610
It might want to capture this
hydrogen proton, so it

107
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,730
captures it by giving
it its electron.

108
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,780
And then that electron that
was associated with that

109
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,025
hydrogen atom is now given
back to this nitrogen.

110
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:31,250
   

111
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,100
And now, once again, I'll draw
this as being in equilibrium.

112
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,520
I'll do this in equilibrium
because one could swipe the

113
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,390
hydrogen from the other.

114
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:46,540
But now this guy over here
becomes ethylammonium.

115
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,450
So I'll draw-- so this is
what he was before.

116
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,250
And now he's bonded
to this hydrogen.

117
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,990
So now he's bonded to this
green hydrogen over here.

118
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,490
Let me make this green
just here.

119
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,160
So that's ethylammonium.

120
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,470
And we saw this in the last
video: ethylammonium.

121
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,130
And then this guy right over
here, and, of course, you have

122
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,180
the bromide floating around, but
this guy over here now is

123
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,080
just a nitrogen bonded
to three ethyl

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
groups: one, two, three.

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,130
It lost its hydrogen, gained
an electron, so it's now

126
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,310
neutral again.

127
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,915
And so this guy is
triethylamine.

128
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:32,850
   

129
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,480
And since he gained that
electron, he had an electron

130
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,170
here, an electron there, so this
is the electron that he

131
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,760
already had and that magenta
electron he gets back, and he

132
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,180
has a lone pair.

133
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,130
So you might say, hey Sal, but
couldn't this guy, couldn't

134
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,240
triethylamine act as
a nucleophile?

135
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,650
And you would be right.

136
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,430
So the triethylamine, if you
still have some of that

137
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:59,800
bromoethane hanging around--
so let me draw some

138
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,860
bromoethane.

139
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,330
And obviously, there's
some hydrogen here.

140
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,860
There is some hydrogen here.

141
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,610
If you have some more of that
bromoethane hanging around,

142
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,040
this guy could then attack that
bromoethane and then you

143
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:18,050
would be left with-- what
would that look like?

144
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,400
Let me do it in that
same color.

145
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,030
So in that green color,
you have the nitrogen.

146
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,740
It has its three original ethane
groups or ethyl groups

147
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,510
that's attached to it.

148
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,900
It has this electron.

149
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,040
But it's now bonded to this
carbon over here.

150
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
And let me be very clear.

151
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,100
This was an Sn2 reaction.

152
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,330
So right when it attacks that
carbon, this bromine, and we

153
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,580
saw this multiple times, can
take that other electron from

154
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,970
the carbon, and so this becomes
another bromide anion.

155
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,060
I'm going a little bit faster
than I've done in the past

156
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,650
because we've seen this many,
many, many, many times.

157
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,670
And now this guy is attached
to this ethyl group.

158
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,210
So this ethyl group I could
just draw like this.

159
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,850
   

160
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,090
He gave this carbon, this
magenta electron there, and so

161
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,080
we have this new bond.

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,400
And I could also draw
the hydrogens.

163
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,090
We have this hydrogen
and this hydrogen.

164
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,530
We could draw them off like
this, hydrogen and hydrogen,

165
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,500
but that makes the drawing a
little bit more confusing.

166
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,950
But what just happened?

167
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,200
This guy gave away
an electron.

168
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,900
Let me make it clear.

169
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,510
He gave away an electron so he
has now a positive charge.

170
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,690
You have the bromine turned
into bromide.

171
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,840
It took an electron.

172
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,559
But what is this now?

173
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,174
This is tetraethylammonium.

174
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:38,490
   

175
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,780
So we have four.

176
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:48,110
It's a quaternary ammonium.

177
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,400
So this is tetra, tetra for
four: one, two, three, four.

178
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,650
Tetraethylammonium.

179
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,990
   

180
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,910
Ammonium, instead of amine,
because it has

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,170
that positive charge.

182
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,610
The nitrogen has four bonds.

183
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,270
It's given away an electron.

184
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,980
Tetraethylammonium, and then if
you view it as a salt with

185
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,630
the bromide anion, it's
tetraethylammonium bromide.

186
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,580
   

187
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,230
So the whole point of this video
and the last video is--

188
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,490
in the last video, I just wanted
to show you that an

189
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,235
amine, it's reasonably basic.

190
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:25,590
It can act as a nucleophile,
and show you how it would

191
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,770
react, show you the mechanism.

192
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,220
But what I wanted to show you
in this video is that that

193
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,780
reaction just keeps going.

194
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,450
And so when you start with the
original ingredients, when you

195
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,580
started with the ethylamine and
the bromoethane, you might

196
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,720
say, oh, this is
pretty simple.

197
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,940
You're just going to end
up with a little bit of

198
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,300
diethylamine.

199
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,140
But the reality is you're going
to end up with all of

200
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,560
this stuff.

201
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,600
It's going to be all mixed up
in every different way.

202
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
You're going to end up with some
diethylamine in there.

203
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,440
You're going to have some
ethylamine in there.

204
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,980
You're going to have some
ammonium in there.

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,110
You'll have some
triethylammonium in there.

206
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,530
You'll have some
ethylammonium.

207
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,010
in there.

208
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,815
You're going to have a little
bit of everything.

209
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,510
   

210
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,050
Oh, let me be clear here.

211
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,300
I just want to make
sure I didn't

212
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,980
misname any of this stuff.

213
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,390
No.

214
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes, I think I named it right.

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,110
Sometimes I get confused with
the ammoniums and amines.

216
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,170
But the whole point of this is
that this reaction can keep

217
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,060
going and this Sn2 reaction can
keep occurring in a bunch

218
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,230
of different ways.

219
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,267
