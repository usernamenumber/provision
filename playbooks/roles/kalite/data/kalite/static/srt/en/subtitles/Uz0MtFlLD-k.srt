1
00:00:01,091 --> 00:00:05,410
Is the relation given by the set of ordered pairs shown below a function?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,033
So before we even attempt to do this problem right here,

3
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:10,867
lets just remind ourselves what a relation is

4
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:13,351
and what type of relations can

5
00:00:13,351 --> 99:59:59,999
be functions.
