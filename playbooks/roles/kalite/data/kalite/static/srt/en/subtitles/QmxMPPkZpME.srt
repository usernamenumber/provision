1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,950
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,350
Well what I want to do now is
actually I'm going to use this

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,920
graphing application to explore
the trigonometric functions or

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,450
explore the graphs of them.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,480
And just to start off or just
to let you, this application

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,010
I'm using is from gcalc.net.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,940
it's G C A L C .net.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,030
It's not mine, but I want to
give them credit because

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,090
that's what I'm using and
I hope they don't mind.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,440
So let's start off just
graphing some functions.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,750
Let's start off with
the sine function.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,820
So let's say sine of x.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,420
I hope you all can see it.

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm typing it in up here.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,580
So sine x, let me graph that.

16
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:35,890
Look at that.

17
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,260
Like how nice that looks.

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,530
So let's interpret this.

19
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,250
So it's oscillating
between-- well, let's

20
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,280
just go point by point.

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,780
I guess that's the
easiest way to do it.

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,900
So when x is equal to 0, what
is the value of this function?

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,720
Well, if we look here, the
value of the function is--

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,510
let me actually trace it.

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,370
When x equals 0 and it has
it written down at the

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,320
bottom of this grey area.

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,450
So when x is 0, y is also 0.

28
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,060
And if you're remember when we
looked for the definitions

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,040
in the unit circle
that's what we got.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,080
That the sine of
0 radians is 0.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,060
And now as we move on, or
move along the curve, I

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,620
have the trace function on.

33
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,820
This is when x is equal-- if we
look in the grey area at the

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,650
bottom left it says 1.57.

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,180
But what is that?

36
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,240
If you're familiar with
the-- 1.57 is more

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,580
commonly known as what?

38
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,510
It's 1/2 of what famous number?

39
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:36,840
Right.

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,010
It's half of pi.

41
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,910
We're at pi over 2.

42
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,020
And if you want to convert
pi over 2 to degrees

43
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,860
that's 90 degrees.

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,620
So when we're at the angle of
pi over 2 radians the sine

45
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,520
function is equal to 1.

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,410
And if you go back to some
previous modules you'll

47
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,060
remember that that's exactly
what the sine function was

48
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,270
equal to when we looked
at the unit circle.

49
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,045
Because we were essentially
at the point 1 comma 0.

50
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,550
I hope it's not confusing that
I keep referring to the unit

51
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,470
circle that you can't see.

52
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,460
But we'll keep going.

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,380
But one thing I want to
introduce here is the concept

54
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,840
of the period or the frequency
of the sine function.

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,280
It's pretty obvious to you at
this point that the function

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,440
keeps repeating itself.

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,910
It goes from 0, moves up to
1, goes back to 0, goes

58
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,850
down to negative 1.

59
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,500
Then goes back to 0 and
then repeats again.

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
So the period of this periodic
function because that's what we

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,100
call a function that keeps
repeating, the period of this

62
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,100
periodic function is this
distance from here to here.

63
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,760
And what's that?

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,450
Well, that's 2 pi radians.

65
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,770
And does that make sense?

66
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,660
Well sure, because 2 pi radians
is one complete revolution

67
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,990
around the unit circle.

68
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,650
And then it repeats again.

69
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,130
And then it goes the other way.

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,450
You go 2 pi radians
backwards and things

71
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,850
start repeating again.

72
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,580
Pretty interesting, right?

73
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,200
Oh, and another thing.

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,380
What two numbers does
it oscillate between?

75
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,970
It oscillates between
positive 1 and negative 1.

76
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,450
And that makes sense because in
the unit circle you can never

77
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,750
get to a point on the perimeter
of the unit circle that's

78
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,700
larger than positive 1 or
less than negative 1.

79
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,150
And that's why the sine of x
keeps oscillating between

80
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,990
these two points.

81
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,760
Let's do the cosine of x.

82
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,030
Actually, I'm going to
leave the sine of x there.

83
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,520
Interesting.

84
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,095
It looks almost the same,
but it looks shifted.

85
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,670
It actually looks shifted
to the left about

86
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,360
pi over 2 radians.

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
And that's actually the case.

88
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,550
So let's first think about why.

89
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,970
We figured out before that
sine-- actually, it looks

90
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,830
like this program is still
tracing the sine function.

91
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,630
That sine of 0 was 0.

92
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,340
But if you look at the green
function, the cosine of

93
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,580
0 radians is actually 1.

94
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,470
Let me see if I can-- no.

95
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,150
I don't know how to trace
the cosine function, so

96
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,130
I'll just do it here.

97
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,930
The cosine of 0 is 1.

98
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,110
And why does that make sense?

99
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,450
Well, the cosine is
the x-coordinate on

100
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,150
the unit circle.

101
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,530
   

102
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,900
When you have 0 radians or 0
degrees, you're at the point 1

103
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,080
comma 0 on the unit circle.

104
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,270
So 1 is the cosine or is
the x-coordinate and

105
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,380
0 is the sine value.

106
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,620
And if any of this is
confusing, review the video

107
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,410
where I use the unit circle to
solve the various values of the

108
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,880
trig functions and then
this should make sense.

109
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,840
And notice that this has
a period similar to

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,650
the sine function.

111
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,100
It starts at 1, goes down
to negative 1, and then

112
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,000
comes back to positive 1.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,560
And it takes 2 pi radians
to complete that cycle.

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,210
And just like the sine function
it's oscillating between 1 and

115
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,370
negative 1 because on the unit
circle you can't get to a point

116
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,850
on the perimeter that's
higher than that.

117
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,450
And now to really hit
the point home let's do

118
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,290
the tangent function.

119
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,280
I think this one
might surprise you.

120
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,470
Well, look at that.

121
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,860
So the blue line is
the tangent function.

122
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,280
And why does it do
this crazy thing?

123
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,620
Well, if you remember, the
tangent function is equal to

124
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,625
the y over the x on the
perimeter of the unit circle.

125
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,130
   

126
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,350
Or since the y is the sine and
cosine is the x, it also equals

127
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,260
the sine over the cosine.

128
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,240
So here, tangent is 0
whatever sine is 0

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,050
because that makes sense.

130
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,025
Because tangent is equal
to sine over cosine.

131
00:05:39,025 --> 00:05:42,590
So it makes sense that when
sine is 0, tangent is 0.

132
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,770
But then, as the sine function
becomes greater and the cosine

133
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,100
function becomes less, the
numerator in the tangent

134
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,420
function becomes greater
because the numerator is sine.

135
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,690
So we get larger and larger
values, all the way to the

136
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,225
point where the denominator of
the tangent function, which is

137
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:03,970
the cosine function-- I think
this is probably the most

138
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,870
confusing module I've ever
said because I can't really

139
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,910
write these things down.

140
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,020
The denominator goes to 0.

141
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,000
The cosine right here.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,070
And then tan spikes and it
actually approaches infinity.

143
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,210
And if you look back at the
unit circle, that actually

144
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,750
might make a little
bit of sense.

145
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,980
But like the other functions,
actually the tangent

146
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,210
function has a period of pi
instead of pi over 2.

147
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,130
Instead of 2 pi.

148
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,050
And I'll leave that as
an exercise for you

149
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,630
to think about.

150
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,450
But with that drawn
out, I'm now going to

151
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,650
explore something else.

152
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,380
Let me reset this.

153
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,070
Yes, I really want to reset.

154
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,860
I drew the sine
function before.

155
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,650
Let me draw the sine
of let's say, 2x.

156
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,000
Whoops, that's not right.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,820
sine of 2-- maybe I need to
put some parentheses in.

158
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,090
Oh, there we go.

159
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,760
Actually, let me reset it.

160
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,980
Yes, I want to reset.

161
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,400
So first I'll draw the
sine of x and then I'll

162
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,310
draw the sine of 2x.

163
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,250
   

164
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,970
So what's the first thing you
notice about the difference

165
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,570
between these two?

166
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,760
The brown one is sine of x and
the green one is sine of 2x.

167
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,680
   

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,860
They both oscillate between the
same two numbers and just so

169
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,600
you know, the height of the
oscillation is called

170
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,630
the amplitude of this
periodic function.

171
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,410
So in both cases, the amplitude
is 1 because they oscillate

172
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,950
from 1 to negative 1.

173
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,550
So the amplitude is 1, but
their period is different.

174
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,860
Sine of x takes 2 pi radians to
complete one circle-- one cycle

175
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,910
while sine of 2x only takes pi
radians to complete one cycle.

176
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,572
So it actually completes
it twice as fast.

177
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:59,480
And I want you to sit and think
about why sine of 2x has 1/2

178
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,390
the period of sine of x.

179
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,820
And you can probably
guess what happens if

180
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,420
I type in sine of 3x.

181
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,030
Actually, let's do sine of 4x.

182
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,770
It should have 1/2 the
period of sine of 2x then.

183
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,530
And it does, even though
this is probably a

184
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,950
very confusing graph.

185
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,920
So let's explore.

186
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,550
So I think you understand
what the coefficient

187
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,650
on the x term does.

188
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,680
When you have a larger
coefficient it kind of

189
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,570
speeds up the cycles.

190
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,876
And let's explore a
little bit more.

191
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,670
Let's start off with
sine of x again.

192
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,220
And now, instead of making the
coefficient larger, let's

193
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,380
make the coefficient less.

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,090
Let's make it sine of 0.5x.

195
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,600
Look at that.

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,960
Now, all of a sudden, it
takes 4 pi radians to

197
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,030
complete one cycle.

198
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,830
And I want you to think
about why that is.

199
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,480
Because we're now slowing
down how fast it cycles

200
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,275
through the angles.

201
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:54,820
   

202
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,500
Now I want to start playing
with the amplitude.

203
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,310
So we had sine of x, what do
you think will happen if I put

204
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,330
in this 2 times sine of x?

205
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,840
So here, the period
is the same.

206
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,540
It's still 2 pi, but notice
that it oscillates between 2

207
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,840
and negative 2 instead of
between 1 and negative 1.

208
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,120
So whatever the coefficient, or
whatever the number is in front

209
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,690
of the sine or the cosine
function, that actually

210
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,885
affects its amplitude.

211
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:34,030
And similarly, we can
look at 0.5 sine-- let's

212
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,970
say 0.5 sine of 2x.

213
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:39,480
Interesting.

214
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,340
So now it only goes up to
0.5 and down to minus 0.5.

215
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,780
So it's amplitude
is 1/2 or 0.5.

216
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,290
And it also oscillates twice
as fast as the sine function

217
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,300
because it was 0.5 sine of 2x.

218
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,840
I think that's all
the time I have now.

219
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,020
I have a feeling this might
have confused you more than

220
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,240
helped, but I'll still put
the video up just in case

221
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,230
it's helpful for someone.

222
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,950
But in the future I might
actually record another video

223
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,980
where I can actually write
things down so it doesn't

224
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,950
confuse you as much.

225
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,080
So if it confused you
I apologize, but I

226
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,940
hope it was helpful.

227
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,470
See you later.
