1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
So, this diagram over here, I have this big triangle

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,590
I have all these little triangles inside of this big triangle.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,070
And what I wanna do is see if I could figure out the measure

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,940
of this angle, right here.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,560
And we'll call that measure theta.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,710
And they tell us a few other things,

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,170
you might have seen this symbol before

8
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,990
these means they are right angles

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,050
or that they have a measure of 90 degrees.

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,890
So, that's a 90 degree angle, that is a 90 degree angle

11
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,750
and that is a 90 degree angle over there.

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,630
And they also tell us that this angle over here is 32 degrees.

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,290
So, let's see what we can do,

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,270
and maybe we can solve this in multiple different ways.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,890
That's what really fun about this,

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,070
there's multiple ways to solve these problems.

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,910
So, if this angle is theta, we have theta is adjacent to this angle,

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,380
it's adjacent to this green angle.

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,010
And if you add them together you're gonna get this right angle

20
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,810
you're gonna get this right angle.

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,970
So, this pink angle, theta, plus this green angle

22
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,460
must be equal to 90 degrees.

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,140
When you combine them, you get a right angle.

24
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,650
So, you could call this one,

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,490
it's measure is gonna be 90 minus theta.

26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,790
And now we have, now we have 3 angles in the triangle

27
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,830
and we just have to solve for theta.

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,670
Because we know that this angle plus this angle plus this angle

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,510
are gonna be equal to 180 degrees.

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,830
So you have 90 minus theta plus 90 degrees, so plus 90 degrees

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,620
plus 90 degrees plus 32 degrees,

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,490
so we're gonna use a different color,

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,960
plus 32 degrees, plus 32 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,410
The sum of the of the measures of the angle

35
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,120
inside the triangle add up to 180 degrees.

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,360
That's all we're doing over here.

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,240
And so let's see if we can simplify this a little bit.

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,180
So if we subtract these 2 guys, 90 plus 90 is gonna be a 180

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,490
so you get 180 minus theta plus 32 is equal to 180 degrees.

40
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,110
And then we have, what else do we have?

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,290
We have a 180 on both sides,

42
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,870
we can subtract that from both sides.

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,870
So, that cancels out that goes to 0.

44
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,800
And you have negative theta plus 32 degree is equal to 0.

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,970
You could add theta to both sides

46
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,310
and you get 32 degrees is equal to theta

47
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,660
or theta is equal to 32 degrees.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,000
So, it's gonna be actually the same measure as this angle over here.

49
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,730
That's one way to the do the problem.

50
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,230
There's other ways that we could have done the problem.

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,900
We could have said and actually there's a ton of ways

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,830
we could have done this.

53
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,470
We can look at this big triangle over here,

54
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,480
we can say look if this is 90 degrees over here

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,640
this is 32 degrees over here, this angle up here

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,260
is gonna be 180 minus 90 degrees minus 32 degrees.

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,870
Because they all have to add up to 180 degrees.

58
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,090
And I just kinda skipped a step over there,

59
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,510
obviously this, actually let me not skip a step.

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,120
Let me call this X, if we call that the measure of that angle X

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,240
we would have X plus 90,

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,710
I'm looking at the biggest triangle in this diagram right here.

63
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:05,470
X plus 90 plus 32 plus 32 is going to be equal 180 degrees.

64
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,470
And so, if you subtract 90 and 32 from both sides,

65
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,890
so if you subtract 90 from both sides

66
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,000
you get X plus 32 is equal to 90.

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,810
And if you subtract 32 from both sides you get X is equal to

68
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,910
What is this?

69
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,850
58 degrees, X is equal to 58 degrees.

70
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,020
X is equal to 58 degrees.

71
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,070
Fair enough.

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,590
What else could we figure out?

73
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,190
Well if this angle here, if this angle over here is a right angle.

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,870
And I'm just redoing the problem all over again,

75
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,800
just to show you there's multiple ways to get the answer.

76
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,600
We were given, if this is a right angle,

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,420
if that is 90 degrees, then this angle over here is supplementary to it

78
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,320
and it also has to be 90 degrees.

79
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:52,030
So we have this angle plus 90 degrees plus this angle,

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,440
plus this angle, plus this angle have to equal to 180,

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,690
maybe we can call that Y.

82
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,300
So Y plus 58 plus 90 is equal to 180.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,740
You can subtract 90 from both sides, subtract 90 from both sides.

84
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,890
This will become 90, subtract 58 from both sides

85
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,600
you get Y is equal to 32 degrees.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,100
Y is equal to 32 degrees.

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,880
Well if Y is equal to 32 degrees, it's is complimentary

88
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,230
it is complimentary to this angle right over here.

89
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,820
it is complimentary, I'll give it a new color.

90
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,210
Not supplementary, it's complimentary it adds up to 90 degrees.

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,440
It is complimentary to this angle over here, we can call it Z.

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,900
So, these two combined are gonna add up to 90 degrees

93
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,090
or Z is going to be equal to 58 degrees.

94
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,360
And now we're inside the triangle that we care about

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
to figure out theta, we already figured out earlier on this video.

96
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,010
Well this is 58 degrees, if this over here is 90

97
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,740
then this one over here is also going to be 90

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,960
because they are supplementary.

99
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
So you have 58 degrees, you have 58 degrees

100
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,040
I wanna do that orange color.

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,330
So, if you have 58 degrees plus this 90, plus 90 plus theta now

102
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,870
plus theta now is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

103
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,440
You can subtract 90 from both sides, that becomes 90

104
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,800
and you have 58 plus theta is equal to 90 subtract 58 from both sides

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,640
you get theta is equal to 32 degrees again.

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,430
And so we got the same answer.

107
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,030
I just wanna do that, to show you that there are multiple ways

108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,410
to do this problem, and as long as you're doing things

109
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,640
that are logically consistent you're making assumptions

110
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,380
that you can make and then logically deducing step by step,

111
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,840
there's multiple ways to get that right answer.
