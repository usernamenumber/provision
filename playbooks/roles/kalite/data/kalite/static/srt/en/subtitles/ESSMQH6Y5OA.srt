1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:00,710
OK.

3
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,870
I've got some matrix A.

4
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,980
It's an n by k matrix.

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's say it's not just
any n by k matrix.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,650
This matrix A has a bunch of
columns that are all linearly

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,400
independent.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
So, a1.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,440
a2, all the way through ak
are linearly independent.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,590
They are linearly independent
columns.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,250
Let me write that down.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,620
a1, a2, all the column
vectors of A.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,430
All the way through ak are
linearly independent.

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,460
Now, what does that mean?

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,250
That means that the only
solution to x1 times a1 plus

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:49,820
x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xk times ak.

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,320
The only solution to this is all
of these x's have to be 0.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,210
So, all xi's must
be equal to 0.

19
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,740
That's what linear independence
implies.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,060
Or another way to write it is
all the solutions to this

21
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,350
equation x1, x2, all
the way down to xk

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,090
equaling the zero vector.

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,410
That all the solutions to this
are all of these entries have

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,260
to be equal to 0.

25
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,730
This is just another way of
writing this right there.

26
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,970
We've seen it multiple times.

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,260
That's the zero vector
right there.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,850
So if all of these have to be 0,
that's like saying that the

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:40,310
only solution to Ax is equal
to 0, is x is equal to the

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,320
zero vector.

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,420
Or another way to say it-- this
is all coming out of the

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,090
fact that this guy's columns
are linearly independent.

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,430
So linear independence
of columns.

34
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,950
   

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,870
Based on that, we can say, since
the only solution to Ax

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,630
is equal to 0 is x is equal to
the zero vector, we know that

37
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,220
the null space of A must be
equal to the zero vector.

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,900
Or it's a set with the just
the zero vector in it.

39
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,280
And that is all a
bit of review.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, n by k.

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,350
We don't know its dimensions.

42
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,600
It may or may not be
a square matrix.

43
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,970
So we don't know, necessarily,
whether it's invertible and

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,010
all of that.

45
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,410
But maybe we can construct an
invertible matrix with it.

46
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,530
So, let's study A transpose
times A.

47
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,716
A transpose times A.

48
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:30,610
A is an n by k matrix.

49
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,030
A transpose will be
a k by n matrix.

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,710
So, A transpose A is going
to be a k by k matrix.

51
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,090
So it's a square matrix.

52
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,260
So that's a nice place
to start for

53
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,280
an invertible matrix.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,410
So let's see if it is
actually invertible.

55
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,590
We don't know anything
about A.

56
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,380
All we know is its columns
are linearly independent.

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,760
Let's see if A transpose
A is invertible.

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,160
   

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,980
Essentially, to show that it's
invertible, if we can show

60
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,110
that all of its columns are
linearly independent, then

61
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,220
we'll know it's invertible.

62
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,020
If we have any-- and I'll
get back to this at

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,710
the end of the video.

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:20,400
But if you have a square
matrix with linearly

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,670
independent columns-- remember,
the linearly

66
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,030
independent columns all are
associated with pivot columns

67
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,740
when you put them in reduced
row echelon form.

68
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,660
So if you have a square matrix,
then you're going to

69
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,070
have exactly-- so if it's a k by
k matrix, that means you're

70
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,960
going to have k-- that means
that the reduced row echelon

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:56,590
form of a matrix will have k
pivot columns and be k by k.

72
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,740
And be a square k by k matrix.

73
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,540
And there's only one k by k
matrix with k pivot columns.

74
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,985
And that's the identity
matrix.

75
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:06,660
   

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,240
The k by k identity matrix.

77
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,460
And if when you do something
to reduce row echelon form,

78
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,260
and it you got the identity
matrix, that means that your

79
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,510
matrix is invertible.

80
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,019
   

81
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,810
I could have probably left that
to the end of the video,

82
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,420
but I just want to show you.

83
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,610
If we can show that-- we already
know that this guy's

84
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,670
square, that A transpose
A is a square matrix.

85
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,780
If we can show that, given
that A has linearly

86
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,110
independent columns, that A
transpose times A also has

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,170
linearly independent columns,
and given the columns are

88
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,330
linearly independent, and it's a
square matrix, that tells us

89
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,390
that when we put it into reduced
row echelon form,

90
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,920
we'll get the identity matrix.

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,580
And that tells us that this
thing would be invertible.

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,150
Let's see if we can prove that
all of this guy's columns are

93
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,950
linearly independent.

94
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,910
So let's say I have
some vector V.

95
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:06,050
Let's say my vector V is a
member of the null space of A

96
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,850
transpose A.

97
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:15,230
That means that if I take a
transpose A times my vector v,

98
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,060
I'm going to get the
zero vector.

99
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,040
Fair enough?

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,770
Now, what happens if I multiply
both sides of the

101
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,220
equation times the transpose
of this guy?

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,870
So I'll get a v transpose--
actually let me just do it

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,990
right here.

104
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,560
I multiply v transpose
on this side, and v

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,250
transpose on this side.

106
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,290
You could view this as a
matrix vector product.

107
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:39,810
Right?

108
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,990
Or, in general, if you take a
row vector times a column

109
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,380
vector, it's essentially
their dot product.

110
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,610
So this right-hand side of the
equation, you dot anything

111
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,860
with the zero vector.

112
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,300
   

113
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,000
That is just going to
be the zero vector.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,870
Now what is the left-hand side
of this going to be?

115
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,960
We've seen this before.

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,330
If you have the transpose of--
we can view this as, even

117
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,180
though it's a transpose of a
vector, you can view it as a--

118
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,520
it is a row vector,
but you could also

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,730
view it as a matrix.

120
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,220
Right?

121
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,650
Let's say v is a
k by 1 matrix.

122
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,450
v transpose will be
a 1 by k matrix.

123
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,510
We've seen this before.

124
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,120
That that is equal to the
reverse product, the transpose

125
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,250
of the reverse product.

126
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,340
Or if we take the product of two
things and transpose it,

127
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,240
that's the same thing as taking
the reverse product of

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
the transposes of either
of those two matrices.

129
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,530
So given that, we can replace
this right here with A times a

130
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:55,140
vector v transpose-- and we're
multiplying this vector times

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,290
Av times this vector
right here.

132
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,070
And that is going to be equal
to the zero vector.

133
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,160
Now, what is this?

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,370
If I'm taking some vector's
transpose, and let's say this

135
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,020
is a vector.

136
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,760
Remember, even though I have a
matrix vector product right

137
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,750
here, when I multiply a matrix
times this vector, it will

138
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,260
result in another vector.

139
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,840
So this is a vector, and this
is a vector right here.

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,090
And if I take some vector and I
multiply its transpose times

141
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,120
that vector-- we've
seen this before.

142
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,970
That is the same thing
as y dot y.

143
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,070
These two statements
are identical.

144
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:41,770
So this thing right here is the
same thing as Av dot Av.

145
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,940
   

146
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,050
And so what does the right-hand
side equal?

147
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,920
The right-hand side is going
to be equal to 0.

148
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,950
Actually let me just make
a correction up here.

149
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,550
When I take v transpose times
the zero vector, v transpose

150
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,300
is going to have k elements.

151
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,730
And then the zero vector is also
going to have k elements.

152
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,370
And when I take this product
that's like dotting it.

153
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,540
You're taking the dot
product of v and 0.

154
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,990
So this is a dot product of v
with the zero vector which is

155
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,340
equal to zero, the
scalar zero.

156
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,170
So this right here's
the scalar zero.

157
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,690
I want to make sure
I clarify that.

158
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,470
It wouldn't make sense
otherwise.

159
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,340
So the right-hand side, when I
multiply the zero vector times

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,710
the transpose of v, gets
just the number zero.

161
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,620
No vector zero there.

162
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,230
So this Av dot Av is going
to be equal to 0.

163
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:38,490
Or we could say that the
magnitude, or the length, of

164
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,450
Av squared is equal to 0.

165
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,400
Or that tells us that Av
has to be equal to 0.

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,740
The only vector whose length
is 0, is the zero vector.

167
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,660
So Av-- let me switch colors.

168
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,240
Using that a little
bit too much.

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,640
So we know that Av
must be equal to

170
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,080
0, to the zero vector.

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,590
This must be equal to the zero
vector since its length is 0.

172
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,310
Now, we started off with saying
v is a member of the

173
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,340
null space of a transpose A.

174
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,050
v can be any member of the null
space of A transpose A.

175
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,650
But then from that assumption,
it turns out that V also has

176
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,760
to be a member of the
null space of A.

177
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,140
That Av is equal to 0.

178
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,270
Let's write that down.

179
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:39,220
If v is a member of the null
space of A transpose A, then v

180
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,420
is a member of the
null space of A.

181
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,230
Now, our null space of A,
because A's columns are

182
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,590
linearly independent, it only
contains one vector.

183
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,300
It only contains the
zero vector.

184
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,110
So, if this guy's a member of
the null space of A transpose

185
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,750
A, and he has to be a member
of the null space of A,

186
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,940
there's only one thing
he can be.

187
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,730
There's only one entry there.

188
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,670
So then v has to be equal
to the zero vector.

189
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,760
Or another way to say that is,
any v that's in our null space

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,820
of a transpose A has to
be the zero vector.

191
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,150
Or the null space of A transpose
A is equal to the

192
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,850
null space of A which is equal
to just the zero factor

193
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,760
sitting there.

194
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,910
Now, what does that do for us?

195
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:35,530
That tells us that the only
solution to A transpose A

196
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,640
times some vector x equal to
zero, this says that the only

197
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:52,400
solution is the zero vector is
equal to the zero vector.

198
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,700
Right?

199
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,650
Because the null space of A
transpose A is the same as the

200
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,560
null space of A.

201
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,160
And that just has the
zero vector in it.

202
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,920
The null space is just
the solution to this.

203
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,190
So if the only solution to the
null space is this, that means

204
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:14,570
that the columns of A transpose
A are linearly

205
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,600
independent.

206
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,350
You could, essentially, write
all of the linear combinations

207
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,810
of the columns by the weights
of the entries of x.

208
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,830
We actually did that
at the beginning.

209
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,400
It's the same argument
we used up here.

210
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,270
So if all of their columns are
linearly independent, and I

211
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,530
said it over here, A transpose
A has linearly independent

212
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:39,700
columns, and it's a square
matrix, that was from the

213
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,160
definition of it.

214
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,400
So we now know that A transpose
A if I were to put

215
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,600
it-- let me do this way.

216
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,640
That tells me that the reduced
row echelon form of A

217
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,370
transpose A is going to be equal
to the k by k identity

218
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,930
matrix which tells me that A
transpose A is invertible.

219
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,590
   

220
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,900
Which is a pretty neat result.

221
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,490
I started with the
matrix that has

222
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,910
linearly independent columns.

223
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,240
So it wasn't just any matrix.

224
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,390
It wasn't just any run
of the mill matrix.

225
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,680
It did have linearly independent
columns, but it

226
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,870
might have weird dimensions.

227
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,510
It's not necessarily
a square matrix.

228
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,420
But I could construct
a square matrix.

229
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,320
a transpose A with it.

230
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,550
And we now know that
it also has

231
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,890
linearly independent columns.

232
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,410
It's a square matrix.

233
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,700
And therefore it is invertible.

234
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,400
