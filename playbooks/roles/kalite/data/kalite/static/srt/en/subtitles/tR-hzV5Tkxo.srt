1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,870
Let's say we have some
chloroethene here, and you

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,770
wouldn't have to call this
1-chloro-eth-1-ene, because if

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,370
you just go with chloroethene,
there's only

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,490
one way to draw this.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,710
And the common name for

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,880
chloroethene is vinyl chloride.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,370
So let's say we have a bunch
of chloroethene molecules

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:22,130
along with or mixed with
some hydrogen chloride.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,710
And I've drawn all of the
valence electrons for the

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,910
chlorine atom and I've drawn a
little magenta electron, the

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,960
one that the hydrogen atom
brought to the table.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
So we've seen something
like this before.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
What is likely to happen?

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,910
Well, maybe one of these carbons
is willing to give up

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,630
an electron.

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,310
That electron goes to the
hydrogen because this electron

18
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,450
is already being hogged by the
chlorine, so this hydrogen has

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,140
a partially positive charge.

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,280
Chlorine has a partially
negative charge, so that

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,810
electron would be attracted
to the hydrogen.

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,330
Then this electron
can be completely

23
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,390
hogged by the chlorine.

24
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,710
And if we had to decide which
of these carbons is more

25
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,750
likely to give up the electron,
you just have to say

26
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,910
which one is bonded to things
that it can share electrons a

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,580
little bit with.

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,890
This carbon is only bonded to
hydrogens, so it's already

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,590
hogging their one electron each,
and there are no more

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,150
electrons to share with it.

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,260
This guy is bonded to a
chlorine, so the chlorine has

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,410
a bunch of valence electrons.

33
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,220
It might be able share a little
bit with this carbon if

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,600
this guy became a carbocation.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,680
So this guy will lose
an electron.

36
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,170
This carbon will form the
bond with that hydrogen.

37
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,420
So let's draw it out.

38
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,980
So let's say this carbon's
electron is that blue thing

39
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,580
right there.

40
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,880
Well, we could draw
it like this.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,790
It goes to the hydrogen, and
then the hydrogen's magenta

42
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,560
electron goes to the chlorine.

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,620
This is just a plausible
mechanism.

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,730
Now, once that happens, what
will our setup look like?

45
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,070
What will it look like?

46
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,630
It will have this carbon over
here bonded to two hydrogens.

47
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,700
It has its single bond to that
other carbon that just lost

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,300
its electron, which is bonded to
a hydrogen and a chlorine.

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,980
And now this carbon on
the left, it is now

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,190
bonded to the hydrogen.

51
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,750
That electron went to the
hydrogen and it formed a bond

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,810
with it, so then it
forms a bond.

53
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,490
So that little blue electron is
at this end of the-- I want

54
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,710
to make it blue.

55
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,080
That little blue electron is at
this end of the bond, and

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,050
it is now the hydrogen's
electron.

57
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,500
And that magenta electron went
to the chlorine, so now it is

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,380
a negative ion.

59
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,910
It is a chloride ion.

60
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,350
So we have a chloride ion.

61
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,100
It has its standard seven
valence electrons that it

62
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,150
started off with, but now it
took that magenta electron

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,610
from the hydrogen,
and so now it has

64
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,110
eight valence electrons.

65
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,170
It gained an electron.

66
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,620
It now has a negative charge.

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,420
This guy over here
lost an electron.

68
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,300
He now has a positive charge.

69
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, the next thing that you
might expect to happen, if we

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,220
just followed the pattern of
the last several videos, is

71
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,980
you would say, hey, this guy
will now take an electron from

72
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,940
the chlorine, which is-- or the
chloride anion, I should

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,860
say, which is completely
plausible, but there's also a

74
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,010
bunch of the chloroethane.

75
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,650
This isn't the only molecule
of chloroethene.

76
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,190
I should say chloroethene,
not chloroethane.

77
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,680
Chloroethene sitting around.

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,930
So let's let us throw another
one of those in there.

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,110
So we have more molecules
of this.

80
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,390
So he could take an electron
from this chloride ion, or he

81
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,920
could take an electron from
this guy over here.

82
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,360
Remember, this guy, just like
this guy, who was this guy,

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,260
this guy is OK.

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,900
It doesn't require a super
amount of energy to make this

85
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,980
guy lose his electron.

86
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,130
He's bonded to other things that
are willing to share with

87
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,030
him a little bit.

88
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,770
Maybe he's willing to lose his
electron as opposed to the

89
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,540
chloride ion.

90
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,720
So this guy has-- let me draw
it in-- so this end of this

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,150
bond is green.

92
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,140
And then this goes and bonds
with this carbon.

93
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,640
So this will be a long
bond right here.

94
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,830
So this goes and bonds with
that carbon, essentially

95
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,650
giving that electron
to that carbon.

96
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,340
And then what will our
setup look like?

97
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,542
So after that happens,
we'll look like this.

98
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,940
I probably should have copied
and pasted this

99
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,900
from the get go.

100
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,950
Actually, let me do that before
I-- let me copy and

101
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,260
paste this.

102
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,820
So now let me just draw, copy
and paste this whole thing.

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,330
   

104
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,550
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

105
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,360
Let me select it again.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,560
All right.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,890
Copy and then paste.

108
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,960
There you go.

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
So then we have that thing.

110
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,250
And let me redraw what I
had erased, so that I

111
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,910
could copy and paste.

112
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,420
And then we have this guy went
over to this carbocation, so

113
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,730
he's no longer a carbocation, so
let me erase this, because

114
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,360
now he's gained an electron.

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
He gained that green electron
right there.

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,260
He gained that green electron.

117
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,580
I'll just draw it right there.

118
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,240
And now he's formed a bond
with this carbon.

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,760
And I'll make it blue, just so
we know which carbon we're

120
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,590
talking about.

121
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,270
He's formed a bond.

122
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,800
This bond now moved over to
that carbon because the

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
electron went with it.

124
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,780
So now that bond is to this
carbon right here.

125
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,270
That carbon right over there,
which is bonded to two

126
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,065
hydrogens, and now has a single
bond to the electron

127
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:53,940
that gave up the carbon, has a
single bond to that character

128
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,590
right over here, who is bonded
to a hydrogen and a chlorine.

129
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,360
   

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
And since he now lost an
electron, he now has a

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,290
positive charge.

132
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,850
So if you look at this setup
right here, it looks very

133
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,380
similar to this setup, although
we've added one more

134
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,830
vinyl chloride to the mix.

135
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,250
And the one that we added lost
its electron, or this carbon

136
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,260
lost it electron, and now
it's a carbocation.

137
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,320
So what could happen next?

138
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,030
Well, we have more of this vinyl
chloride sitting around.

139
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,820
   

140
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,850
Let me draw another
vinyl chloride.

141
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,530
So I have a carbon, a hydrogen,
a hydrogen, and then

142
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,130
it is double bonded
to a carbon, a

143
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,636
hydrogen, and a chlorine.

144
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,790
And let me copy and
paste this.

145
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,200
I think you see where this might
be going, how this could

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
keep on going and
going and going.

147
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,450
So copy.

148
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,440
   

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,250
Well, I just copy
that for now.

150
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,880
So what's going to happen now?

151
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,430
This guy could go and give an
electron to this guy and form

152
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,200
a bond, or we could have the
same process happen over and

153
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,130
over and over again.

154
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,760
Let me get my pen tool going.

155
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,040
So this electron could be given
to this carbocation

156
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,290
right there.

157
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,010
   

158
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,840
And then what happens?

159
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,560
Well, if that happens, then
we're going to get-- I'll move

160
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,030
to the left now.

161
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,470
We have our original molecule.

162
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,970
I'm going to run out
of space soon.

163
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,710
We have this original molecule,
and now this guy has

164
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,490
bonded to that.

165
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,970
So this carbon right here is
going to be this carbon, and

166
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,610
now it is bonded to this guy.

167
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,180
That orange electron
is now given to

168
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,240
this guy who was positive.

169
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,220
So he now has-- let me make
it a little bit neater.

170
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,790
I can do a better
job than that.

171
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,700
So the carbon's here.

172
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,750
The bond goes to this guy.

173
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,980
He now has the orange
electron.

174
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,170
He no longer has a
positive charge.

175
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,970
   

176
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,570
He's got all of his valence
electrons now.

177
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,330
And now this guy is bonded
to two hydrogens.

178
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,430
   

179
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,450
That guy is bonded
to two hydrogens.

180
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,260
And he has a single bond, this
single bond right here to the

181
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,890
carbon that just lost his
electron, who's bonded to a

182
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,690
hydrogen and a chlorine.

183
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,760
And because he lost his
electron, he now is the

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,780
carbocation.

185
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,050
He is now a carbocation.

186
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,800
So I think you see where
we're going.

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,780
We can just keep adding and
adding and adding to this

188
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,745
chain of vinyl chloride.

189
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:40,200
So if this process just went
on and on and on, we could

190
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,190
make it like this.

191
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,010
It would look something
like this.

192
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,800
Let me see how well
I can draw it.

193
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,160
So it would look like this.

194
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,670
So this is a CH3.

195
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:57,330
So I'll just draw it as H3C, and
then this is bonded to a

196
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,090
carbon, that is bonded to a--
well, maybe I'll call it a CH,

197
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,720
which is bonded to a chlorine.

198
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,840
So we're that far
in the molecule.

199
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,980
And then we have-- let's see
the part that repeats.

200
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,270
This part right here is going
to keep repeating.

201
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,850
That part right there is going
to keep repeating, and I'm

202
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,280
going to do it like this.

203
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,910
So I'm just going to draw one
of them, so you have a CH2.

204
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,100
That's that right there,
connected to a CH, which is

205
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,190
that right there, which is
connected to a chlorine.

206
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,360
And so that part right there
will keep repeating.

207
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,590
And then maybe the very last
one, so you have this guy

208
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,640
right here, but maybe the very
last one that joins on-- I

209
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,430
mean, this can happen
millions of times.

210
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,340
I just it made it happen
two or three times.

211
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,170
It could happen millions of
times and form a super long

212
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,400
chain or a polymer.

213
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,000
And what we are describing in
this video is actually a

214
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,730
polymer that you have probably
dealt with at some

215
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,650
point in your life.

216
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,380
In fact, I guarantee there's
some of it in

217
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,730
your house right now.

218
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,530
So then we'd have that
part right there.

219
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:07,720
And we could just make
that as CH2, CH, Cl.

220
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,290
   

221
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,960
And now, the way we've drawn
it, it's a carbocation, but

222
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,530
maybe we've run out of all of
the vinyl chloride molecules,

223
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,060
or we could also call them
chloroethene molecules.

224
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,510
And now finally, when everything
is said and done,

225
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,080
this last guy, since he's run
out of vinyl chloride

226
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,790
molecules to take their
electrons from, he now finally

227
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,160
takes it from the chlorine.

228
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,820
So you can imagine this happens
many, many times.

229
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,310
So this repeats many times.

230
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:44,190
After this repeats many times,
then finally, one of these

231
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,180
electrons from the chlorine go
to that final carbocation,

232
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,220
because they've run out of other
vinyl chlorides, and

233
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,720
then he attaches right over
here to the chlorine.

234
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,250
Now, this is called-- so when we
say that this might happen

235
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,630
many times, you might write an
N here, just to show that it

236
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,000
repeats many, many times.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,530
If you know how many times it
repeats, if you know that

238
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,960
there were a thousand molecules
here, you would

239
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,140
write a thousand repetitions,
but this is called a polymer.

240
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,880
   

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,170
And the name for this molecule
right here is-- each of these

242
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,640
units is vinyl chloride,
right?

243
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,530
   

244
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,800
Vinyl chloride.

245
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,170
I guess the official name is
chloroethene, but the typical

246
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,070
name, the one people actually
to use, is vinyl chloride.

247
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,590
That's for each of
these units.

248
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,450
It's a polymer.

249
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,940
We have many of them, so we'll
put a poly- in front of it.

250
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,450
   

251
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,630
So this molecule right here is
polyvinyl chloride, or, and

252
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:54,140
now I think it'll ring a
bell, or PVC for short.

253
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,600
And you've probably heard
of PVC piping.

254
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,610
It's what most people have
for their plumbing.

255
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,780
It's those plastic pipes.

256
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,820
And that's what it is.

257
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,230
It's polyvinyl chloride.

258
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,480
