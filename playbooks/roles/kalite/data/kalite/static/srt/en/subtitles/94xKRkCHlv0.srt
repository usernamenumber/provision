1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,835
(intro music)

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,817
Were in the National Galery in London

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:11,465
and were looking at the 2nd version by Leonardo Davinci

4
00:00:11,465 --> 00:00:13,329
of the "Virgin of the Rocks".

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,453
Their is another version in Paris,

6
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,570
This they think is the second version

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,366
perhapse some of it completed by Leonardo assistances

8
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:23,616
and we should remember when we read that.

9
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:25,504
Thats how artists worked Right!

10
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:26,300
("it's normal")

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,902
It's not a big deal.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,834
They had a workshop and they had assistance.

13
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,372
Assistance sometimes helped to complete the work of a painting.

14
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,488
the IDEA of course is that the work of

15
00:00:33,488 --> 00:00:36,687
a painting is really NOT the actual painting but

16
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:38,586
It's also the " I D E A "

17
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,221
Especialy important for Leonardo!

18
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:42,569
So why is it that there are two versions?

19
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,320
and why such a long period for this painting?

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,822
It was started in 1491

21
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:49,821
it wasn't finished till 1508 and

22
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:51,268
you could actually argue that it was never FINISHED.

23
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:52,971
The commission was started and

24
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,756
Leonardo was promised a bonus when he completed it.

25
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,016
But the "BONUS" he got didn't live up to what

26
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:02,933
he expected and he [he sold it to somebody else] painting to someone else

27
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,175
and he so had to work on a second version

28
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:06,292
and that's what "THIS" is.

29
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:08,725
"The Virgin on the Rocks" is an interesting subject.

30
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:12,707
cause for me I normally think about Mary seated on a throne.

31
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,692
in heaven and here we have another

32
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,006
way of presenting Mary which is

33
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,157
Mary seated on the ground. As a type of image of Mary called

34
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,586
"The Madonna of Humility"

35
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:25,136
showing Marie's humility seated on the ground.

36
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:29,270
It also means the Natural world has become a kind of throne

37
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,919
or Is it more exhalted than it would have previously been undersood?

38
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:36,669
in other words, I think in the renaissance nature it self has been given

39
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,569
a kind of respect. That kind of attention. That's quite a landscape

40
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,988
this is not just a meadow as we might see in a Rafael.

41
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,603
So maybe we should just actually just focus for a moment

42
00:01:41,603 --> 99:59:59,999
on who everbody is. So what's going on here
