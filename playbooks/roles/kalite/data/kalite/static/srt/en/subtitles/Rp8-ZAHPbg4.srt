1
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:05,150
Euler continued to investigate the properties of numbers –

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,007
specifically the distribution of prime numbers.

3
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,919
One important function he defined

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,733
is called the 'phi function.'

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,885
It measures the breakability of a number.

6
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,879
So, given a number, say, 'n,'

7
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,439
it outputs how many integers are less than or equal to n

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,921
that do not share any common factors with n.

9
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:28,375
For example, if we want to find the phi of 8,

10
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,868
we look at all values from 1 to 8,

11
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:32,983
and then we count how many integers

12
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:35,954
8 does not share a factor greater than 1 with.

13
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,371
Notice, 6 is not counted,

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,302
because 6 and 8 share the factor 2,

15
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:42,002
while 1, 3, 5 and 7 are all counted,

16
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,528
because they only share the factor 1.

17
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:48,855
Therefore, phi(8) = 4.

18
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,271
What's interesting is that

19
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:54,523
calculating the Phi function is hard, except in one case.

20
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:56,061
Look at this graph.

21
00:00:56,061 --> 00:01:01,307
It is a plot of values of phi over integers from 1 to 1000.

22
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:04,891
Now, notice any predictable pattern?

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,749
The straight line of points along the top

24
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:11,016
represents all the prime numbers.

25
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:14,463
Since prime numbers have no factors greater than 1,

26
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:19,991
the phi of any prime number, 'p,' is simply p-1.

27
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:22,616
To calculate phi of 7 – a prime number –

28
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,984
we count all integers except 7 –

29
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,575
since none of them share a factor with 7.

30
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,536
Phi of 7 = 6.

31
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:37,905
So if you are asked to find phi of 21,377, a prime number,

32
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:41,356
you would only need to subtract 1 to get the solution –

33
00:01:41,356 --> 00:01:44,132
21,376.

34
00:01:44,132 --> 00:01:48,090
phi of any prime is easy to compute.

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,766
This leads to an interesting result, based on the fact that

36
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:53,875
the phi function is also 'multiplicative.'

37
00:01:53,875 --> 00:02:00,899
That is, phi(A x B)=phi(A) x Phi(B).

38
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,792
If we know some number, N,

39
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:06,666
is the product of two primes, P1 and P2,

40
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,627
then phi of N is just the value of

41
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,434
phi for each prime multiplied together, –

42
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:17,057
or (P1 - 1) x (P2 - 1).
