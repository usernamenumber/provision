1
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,326
Imagine Alice has an idea,

2
00:00:08,326 --> 00:00:10,696
and she wants to share it.

3
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:13,262
There are so many ways to share an idea.

4
00:00:13,262 --> 00:00:14,324
She could draw a picture,

5
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:16,540
make an engraving, write a song,

6
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,889
send a telegraph,

7
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,466
or an email.

8
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:34,747
But how are these things different?

9
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,201
And more importantly,

10
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:38,359
why are they the same?

11
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:45,245
This story is about the fundamental particle

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,437
of all forms of communication.

13
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:50,044
It begins with a special skill

14
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:52,233
you likely take for granted --

15
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,723
language.

16
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:56,643
All language allows you to take a thought --

17
00:00:56,643 --> 00:00:58,244
or mental object --

18
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:02,226
and break it down in a series of conceptual chunks.

19
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:04,216
These chunks are externalized

20
00:01:04,216 --> 00:01:07,846
using a series of signals – or 'symbols.'

21
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:08,960
Humans express themselves

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,768
using a variation in sound and physical action –

23
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:16,090
as do chirping birds –

24
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,381
and dancing bees –

25
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,438
and man-made machines,

26
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,748
exchanging a dancing stream of eletrical vibrations.

27
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,609
Even our bodies are built according to instructions

28
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:31,283
stored inside microscopic books – known as 'DNA.'

29
00:01:31,283 --> 00:01:35,996
All are different forms of one thing – 'information.'

30
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,131
In simplest terms,

31
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:41,467
information is what allows one mind to influence another.

32
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:46,175
It`s based on the idea of communication as selection.

33
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:47,780
Information – no matter the form –

34
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,889
can be measured using a fundamental unit –

35
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,042
in the same way we can measure

36
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:55,163
the mass of different objects – using a standard measure –

37
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:57,092
such as kilograms or pounds.

38
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:59,674
This allows us to precisely measure and compare

39
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,814
the weight of, say, rocks, water, or wheat –

40
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,530
using a scale.

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,865
Information, too, can be measured and compared

42
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:11,861
using a measurement called 'entropy.'

43
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,691
Think of it as an information scale.

44
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,170
We intuitively know that a single page

45
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,691
from some unknown book

46
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,657
has less information than the entire book.

47
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,782
We can describe exactly how much

48
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:27,034
using a unit called the 'bit' –

49
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:29,625
a measure of surprise.

50
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,509
So, no matter how Alice wants to communicate

51
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,437
a specific message –

52
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:37,934
hieroglyphics, music, computer code –

53
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:40,782
each would contain the same number of bits,

54
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:42,977
though in different densities.

55
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:46,978
And a bit is linked to a very simple idea –

56
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:49,373
the answer to a yes-or-no question.

57
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:52,612
Think of it as the 'language of coins.'

58
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:55,662
So how is information actually measured?

59
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:57,625
Does information have a speed limit?

60
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,563
A maximum density?

61
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:04,748
Information theory holds the exciting answer to these questions.

62
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:08,137
It`s an idea over 3000 years in the making.

63
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:09,929
But before we can understand this,

64
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,567
we must step back –

65
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,442
and explore, perhaps, the most powerful invention

66
00:03:14,442 --> 00:03:15,881
in human history –

67
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:17,228
the alphabet.

68
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:20,483
And for this, we return to the cave.
