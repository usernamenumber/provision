1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:03,140
Lets see if we can give ourselves a little bit

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,460
of practice converting between radians and degrees

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,974
and degrees and radians.

4
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:10,944
And just as a review lets just remind ourselves the relationship

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,125
and I always do this before I have to convert between the two.

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:19,620
If I do one revolution of a circle how many radians is that going to be?

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,727
Well we know one revolution of a circle is (2)(pi) radians

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:32,522
and how many degrees is that if I do one revolution around a circle?

9
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:34,975
Well we know that is 360 degrees.....

10
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:40,224
I can either write it with the little degree symbol like that or I can write it just like that.

11
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:43,013
And this is really enough information for us to think about

12
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,040
how to convert between radians and degrees

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,623
if we want to simplify this a little bit we can divide both sides

14
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,061
by 2.

15
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:55,826
And you can have (pi) radians are equal to 180 degrees

16
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,277
or another way to think about it

17
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:02,094
going halfway around a circle in radians is (pi) radians.

18
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:06,438
The arc that subtends that angle is (pi) radiusssses

19
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:09,645
and that's also 180 degrees.

20
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:14,804
And if you wanna really think about, well how many degrees are there per radian

21
00:01:14,804 --> 00:01:18,095
you can divide both sides of this by (pi).

22
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:20,373
So if you divide both sides of this by (pi),

23
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,041
you would get one radian

24
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,179
it would have to go from plural to singular

25
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:29,789
one radian is equal to 180/pi degrees.

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:35,155
So all I did is I divided both sides by (pi)

27
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,929
and if you wanted to figure out how many radians

28
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,405
are there per degree you can divide both sides by 180.

29
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:45,277
So you would get pi/180 radians

30
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:51,676
is equal to 1 degree.

31
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:55,029
So this is....now I think we are ready to start converting.

32
00:01:55,029 --> 00:02:02,242
So lets convert 30 degrees....to radians.

33
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:04,460
So lets think about it.

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm going to write it out and actually this might remind you of unit analysis

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,359
that you might do when you first did unit conversion

36
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,793
but it also works out here.

37
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:14,298
So if I were to write 30 degrees

38
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:16,415
and this is how my brain likes to work with it

39
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:19,206
I like to write out the word degrees.

40
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,211
Well I wanna convert to radians so I really want to figure out

41
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:25,191
how many radians are there per degree?

42
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:35,539
So let me write this down. I wanna figure out how many radians do we have per degree?

43
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,930
And I haven't filled out how many that is

44
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,809
but we see the units will cancel out

45
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,441
if we have degrees times radians/degree

46
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:45,706
the degrees will cancel out and I'll be just left with radians.

47
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:49,475
If I multiply the number of degrees I have times the number of radians per degree

48
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,160
we're gonna get radians.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,007
And hopefully that makes intuitive sense as well.

50
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,495
And here we just have to think about

51
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:59,288
well if I have...think of it this way, if I have

52
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:04,237
pi radians how many degrees is that?

53
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:08,909
Well that's 180 degrees, comes straight out of this right over here

54
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,755
pi radians for every 180 degrees or pi/180 radians/degree.

55
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:20,464
This is going to get us to...we're going to get 30 times pi/180

56
00:03:20,464 --> 00:03:26,188
30 times pi/180

57
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:27,646
which will simplify to

58
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,830
30/180 is 1/6

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,161
so this is equal to pi/6

60
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,626
let me write the units out

61
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:43,727
this is 30 radians which is equal to pi/6 radians.

62
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:45,411
Now lets go the other way

63
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:53,697
lets think about if we have pi/3 radians

64
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:55,758
and I wanna convert that to degrees.

65
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:58,831
So what am I going to get if I convert that to degrees?

66
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,591
Well here we're gonna want to figure out

67
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:05,174
how many degrees are there per radian?

68
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:07,313
One way to think about it is

69
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,642
think about the pi and the 180

70
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:15,043
for every 180 degrees you have pi radians.

71
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:17,195
180 degrees/pi radians

72
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:18,944
these are essentially the equivalent thing

73
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:21,027
essentially you're just multiplying this quantity by 1

74
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,876
but you're changing the units

75
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:26,465
the radians cancel out and then the pi's cancel out

76
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,706
and you're left with 180/3 degrees

77
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:34,577
180/3 is 60 and we can either write out the word degrees or you can write degrees

78
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:36,379
just like that.

79
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,856
Now lets think about 45 degrees.

80
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:44,464
So what about 45 degrees?

81
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:49,061
And I'll write it like that just so you can figure it out with that notation as well.

82
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:53,464
How many radians will this be equal to?

83
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:59,186
Well once again we're gonna want to think about how many radians do we have per degree?

84
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,994
So we're going to multiply this times

85
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:06,765
well we know we have pi radians

86
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:12,756
for every 180 degrees

87
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,965
or we can even write it this way

88
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,710
pi radians for every 180 degrees.

89
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,044
And here this might be a little less intuitive

90
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,289
the degrees cancel out and that's why I usually like to

91
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,542
write out the word

92
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:28,430
and you're left with 45 pi/180 radians.

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,797
Actually let me write this with the words written out

94
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,715
for me that's more intuitive when I'm thinking about it

95
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,863
in terms of using the notation.

96
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:51,577
So 45 degrees times, we have pi radians for every 180 degrees.

97
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:54,072
So we are left with when you multiply

98
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:59,207
45 times pi over 180

99
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:01,695
the degrees have canceled out and you're just left with

100
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,510
radians.

101
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,278
Which is equal to what?

102
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:09,798
45 is half of 90 which is half of 180 so this is 1/4

103
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:15,489
this is equal to pi over 4 radians.

104
00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:19,675
Lets do 1 more over here.

105
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:28,197
So lets say that we had negative pi/2 radians.

106
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:32,676
What's that going to be in degrees?

107
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:34,280
Well once again we have to figure out

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,427
how many degrees

109
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,243
are each of these radians.

110
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:41,691
We know that there 180 degrees

111
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:46,448
for every pi radians

112
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,762
so we're gonna get

113
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:49,182
the radians cancel out

114
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:50,911
the pi's cancel out

115
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,561
and so you have

116
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,333
-180/2

117
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:58,257
this is -90 degrees

118
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:02,660
or we can write it as -90 degrees.

119
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,315
Anyway hopefully you found that helpful

120
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,513
and I'll do a couple more example problems here

121
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,831
because the more example for this

122
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:08,868
the better and hopefully it will become

123
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,000
a little bit intuitive
