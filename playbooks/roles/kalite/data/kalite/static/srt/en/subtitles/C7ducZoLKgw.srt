1
00:00:00,523 --> 00:00:03,036
Let's say I have some function f,

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:11,241
that is continuous on an interval between a and b,

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,946
and I have these brackets here, so it also includes a and b and the interval.

4
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:17,968
So let me graph this, just so we get a sense of what I'm talking about

5
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:24,895
So that's my vertical axis, this is my horizontal axis.
I'm gonna label my horizontal axis t,

6
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:28,698
so that we can save x for later,
and I can still make this y right over there

7
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:34,986
and let me graph, this right over here is the graph of:
y is equal to f(t)

8
00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:41,826
Now, our lower endpoint is a, so that's a,
right over there

9
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:45,708
Our upper boundary is b,

10
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,819
...to make that clear, and actually just to show that we're including that endpoint,

11
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:52,494
let me make them bold lines, filled-in lines.

12
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:56,714
So lower boundary a, upper boundary b,
we're just saying, and I've drawn it this way,

13
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:58,633
that f is continuous on that.

14
00:00:58,633 --> 00:01:04,721
Now, let's define some new function that's the area under the curve

15
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:10,236
between a and some point that's in our interval.

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,135
Let me pick this right over here, x.

17
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:19,309
So let's define some new function, to capture the area under the curve,

18
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:22,575
between a and x.

19
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:26,886
Well, how do we denote the area under the curve between two endpoints?

20
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,642
Well, we just use our definite intergral, that's our Riemann integral, that's really..

21
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:34,501
that right now, before we come up with the conclusion of this video,

22
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,887
it really just represents the area under the curve between two endpoints.

23
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:40,634
So this right over here, we can say is,

24
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:59,570
the definite integral from a to x, of f(t), dt.

25
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,106
Now, this right over here is going to be a function of x,
let me make it clear,

26
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:11,568
where x is in the interval between a and b. 
This thing right over here

27
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,642
is going to be another function of x.
This value is going to depend

28
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:18,468
on what x we actually choose.

29
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:23,109
So let's define this, as a function of x,
so I'm gonna say that this is equal to

30
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:27,773
uppercase F(x).

31
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:32,903
So all fair and good, uppercase F(x) is a function,
if you give me an x value

32
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:38,168
that's between a and b, 
it'll tell you the area under lowercase f(t)

33
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,637
between a and x.

34
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:44,902
Now, the cool part, the fundamental theorem of calculus,

35
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:48,802
the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us,
let me write this down,

36
00:02:48,802 --> 00:03:00,378
it's a big deal. 
Fundamental theorem of calculus tells us,

37
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:06,669
that if we were to take the derivative of our capital F,

38
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:09,769
so if I were to take the derivative
of capital F with respect to x,

39
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,703
which is the same thing as taking the derivative of this,
with respect to x,

40
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:18,128
which is equal to the derivative of all of this business,
let me copy this

41
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:24,901
So, copy, and then paste.
Which is the same thing,

42
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:28,502
I've defined capital F as this stuff,
so if I'm taking the derivative of the left hand side,

43
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:30,902
it's the same thing as taking the derivative of the right hand side.

44
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:34,101
The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us,

45
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:37,384
that this is going to be equal to,

46
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:43,502
it's going to be equal to f,
lowercase f(x)

47
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:48,245
Now, why is this a big deal?
Why does it get such an important title,

48
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:53,969
as the fundamental theorem of calculus?

49
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,769
Well, it tells us, that for any continuous function f,

50
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,546
If I define a function, that is the area under the curve
between a and x right over here,

51
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:08,510
that the derivative of that function is going to be f.

52
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,635
So let me make it clear,

53
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:26,966
every continuous f has an antiderivative F(x).

54
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,169
That by itself is a cool thing,
but the other really cool thing,

55
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,054
or I guess these are somewhat related, is, 
remember, coming into this,

56
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:39,884
all we did is, we just viewed the definite integral
as symbolizing the area under the curve

57
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:43,030
between two points.
That's where that Riemann definition

58
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,530
of integration comes from. But now we see a connection,

59
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,446
between that and derivatives.
When you're taking the definite integral,

60
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:55,279
one way of thinking, especially if you're taking the definite integral between a lower boundary and an x,

61
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,869
one way of thinking about it is that you're essentially taking an antiderivative.

62
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,299
So we now see a connection,

63
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:04,234
this is why it is the fundamental theorem of calculus,

64
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:13,782
it connects differential calculus and integral calculus.
Connection between derivatives,

65
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:17,967
and (maybe I should say antiderivatives), 
derivatives and integration,

66
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:21,566
which before this video, we just viewed integration as area under the curve.

67
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:24,287
Now we see it has a connection to derivatives.

68
00:05:24,287 --> 00:05:30,037
So how would you actually use the fundamental theorem of calculus, maybe in the context of a calculus class,

69
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,536
and we'll do the intuition for why this happens,

70
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:35,165
or why this is true, and maybe a proof in later videos,

71
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,028
but how would you actually apply this right over here?

72
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:43,531
Well, let's say someone told you, that they want to find the derivative,

73
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:50,507
Let's say someone wanted to find the derivative with respect to x

74
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:54,840
of the integral from, I don't know, I'll pick some random number here,

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,784
Pi to x, of,
I'll put something crazy here,

76
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:10,703
cosine squared of t, over the natural log of t minus the square root of t, dt.

77
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,898
So they want you to take the derivative with respect to x of this crazy thing,

78
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:18,790
Remember, this thing in the parentheses, is a function of x.

79
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,036
Its value, it's going to have a value that is dependent on x,
you give it a different x,

80
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:26,389
and it's going to have a different value.
So what's the derivative of this with respect to x?

81
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,141
Well, the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us it can be very simple.

82
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:36,806
We essentially, and you can even pattern match up here, 
we'll get more intuition of why this is true in future videos,

83
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:41,052
but essentially, everywhere where you see this right over here is an f(t)

84
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,472
everywhere you see a t, replace it with an x, and it becomes an f(x).

85
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,030
So this is going to be equal to

86
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:53,832
cosine squared of x, over the natural log of x minus the square root of x,

87
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:58,500
you take the derivative of the indefinite integral, where the upper boundary is x right over here,

88
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,471
just becomes, whatever you were taking the integral of, that as a function of, instead of t,

89
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,799
that is now a function of x.

90
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:10,233
So it can really simplify sometimes, taking a derivative,

91
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,830
and sometimes, you'll see on exams,

92
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,499
these trick problems where you have this really hairy thing that you need to take a definite integral of

93
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,767
and then take the derivative,

94
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,305
you just have to remember the fundamental theorem of calculus,

95
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,297
the thing that ties it all together,
it connects derivatives and integration,

96
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:26,775
you can just simplify it, by realizing that this is just going to be,

97
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:31,567
instead of a function lowercase f(t), it's going to lowercase f(x),

98
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,635
let me make it clear, in this example right over here,

99
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:37,133
this right over here was lowercase f(t),

100
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:40,965
and now it became lowercase f(x).

101
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:45,233
This right over here was our a,

102
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,883
and notice, it doesn't matter what the lower boundary of a actually is.

103
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:52,840
You don't have something on the right hand side that is in some way dependent on a.

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,099
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that and in the next few videos, we'll think about the intuition,

105
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,099
and do more examples making use of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
