1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,470
Let's tackle a slightly
harder problem than what

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,640
we saw in the last video.

4
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:11,550
I have here x minus 3
over x plus 4 is greater

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,550
than or equal to 2.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,630
So the reason why this is
slightly harder is I now have

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,690
a greater than or equal to.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,490
And the other thing that makes
it slightly harder is I don't

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,330
just have a simple 0 here,
I actually have a 2 here.

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,360
So I'm going to do this
problem the same way.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,240
I'm going to do it two ways.

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm going to do the same two
ways we did last time, but I'm

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,170
going to reverse the order of
the two ways that I do it.

14
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,180
So the first thing I can do,
I might be tempted-- let me

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,770
multiply both sides of this
equation times x plus 4.

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,120
And like we saw in the last
video we had to be very

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,350
careful because we have
an inequality here.

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,200
If x plus 4 is greater than
0 then we're going to keep

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,050
the inequality the same.

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,840
If it's less than 0
we're going to swap it.

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,800
So let's look at those
two situations.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,600
So one situation is-- let
me make it right here.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,720
One situation is x plus
4 is greater then 0.

24
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,650
And remember, it can ever be
equal to 0 because then this

25
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,740
expression would be undefined.

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,300
So let's explore x plus
4 is greater than 0.

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,650
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation this is

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,610
equivalent to saying-- these
are equivalent statements.

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,810
If we subtract 4 from
both sides that x is

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,800
greater than minus 4.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,720
So if we assume that x is
greater than minus 4 then

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
x plus 4 is going to
be greater than 0.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,425
And then when we multiply
both sides of this times

34
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,430
x plus 4-- let's do that.

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,660
x minus 3 over x plus 4.

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,020
You have your 2.

37
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,720
We're going to multiply both
sides of this times x plus 4.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,710
Since we're assuming x is
greater than minus 4 or that x

39
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,690
plus 4 is greater than 0, we
don't have to switch

40
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,010
the inequality sign.

41
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,010
We're multiplying both
sides by a positive.

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,300
So the inequality stays
the same as in our

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,530
original problem.

44
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,380
And the whole reason why we
did that is because this

45
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,810
and this will cancel out.

46
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,390
And then we have 2
times x plus 4.

47
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,870
Let's see what we get.

48
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,700
x minus 3 is greater than
or equal to 2 times x plus

49
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,420
2 times 4, which is 8.

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,120
And now what can we do?

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,530
We can subtract x
from both sides.

52
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,700
We get minus 3 is greater
than or equal to x plus 8.

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,860
I just took x from 2x.

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,900
And then we can subtract
8 from both sides.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,640
So you subtract 8
from both sides.

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,150
You get minus 3 minus 8
is minus 11 is greater

57
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,580
than or equal to x.

58
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,130
And of course, then we subtract
an 8 so this guy disappears.

59
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,720
So if we assume that x is
greater than minus 4, then

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,610
x has to be less than
or equal to minus 11.

61
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,100
Now that seems a little
bit nonsensical.

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,300
In order for this statement to
be true, x has to be both

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,150
greater than minus 4 and it has
to be less than minus 11.

64
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,460
Anything greater than
minus 4 is going to be

65
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,240
greater than minus 11.

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,310
So there's no x that
satisfies this equation.

67
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,230
So if we assume that x plus 4
is greater than 0, we just end

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,080
up with a nonsensical solution.

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,090
So we can actually
ignore that path.

70
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,280
There's no situation in which x
plus 4 is going to be greater

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,030
than 0 and we're going to
actually have a solution

72
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,250
to this equation.

73
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,840
So let's assume what happens
when x plus 4 is less than 0.

74
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,850
I'll do it here.

75
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,120
So what happens when x
plus 4 is less than 0?

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,860
And once again, that's an
equivalent statement.

77
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,580
If we subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,530
to saying that x is
less than minus 4.

79
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,880
These are equivalent
statements.

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,780
So if we assume that x is less
than minus 4, then when we

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,090
multiply both sides of this
equation times x plus 4 and

82
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,300
you're multiplying it by
x minus 3 over x plus 4.

83
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,840
And you have your 2 and
you're multiplying

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,860
that times x plus 4.

85
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,320
Since we're taking the other
situation where x is less than

86
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,945
minus 4, which makes this
expression negative-- since

87
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,630
we're multiplying both sides of
the equation by a negative, we

88
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,780
swap the inequality
just like that.

89
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,960
And let's see what we get.

90
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,550
This and this cancel out.

91
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,170
And then we get x minus 3 is
less than or equal to 2 times

92
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,190
x plus 2 times 4, which is 8.

93
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,100
And we do the same algebra.

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,080
Let's subtract x
from both sides.

95
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,955
We get minus 3 is less than
or equal to x plus 8.

96
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:41,410
If we subtract 8 from both
sides we get minus 11 is

97
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,800
less than or equal to x.

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,640
   

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,790
If we assume this is
negative, we get x has

100
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,290
to be less than minus 4.

101
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,800
If x is less than minus 4, in
order for this equation to

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,160
hold up, x also has to be
greater than minus 11.

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,130
And this is actually possible.

104
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,440
You can have an x, so x has
to be-- we can rewrite

105
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,480
this-- greater than
or equal to minus 11.

106
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,230
I just swapped the two sides.

107
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,970
And x has to be
less than minus 4.

108
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,720
And there are x's that satisfy
these two constraints.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,980
There weren't x's that satisfy
these two constraints.

110
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,330
Nothing satisfies both of
these, but there are things

111
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,870
that satisfy both of these.

112
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,630
For example, minus 5.

113
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,910
Let's draw this on
the number line.

114
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,590
Let's draw a solution
to this problem.

115
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,320
Let me keep the problem there.

116
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,820
If I draw a number line,
I want to switch colors.

117
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,390
So we have minus 11.

118
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,010
We can be greater than
or equal to minus 11.

119
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,370
So this is minus 11.

120
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,740
And then we have
minus 4 over here.

121
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,610
   

122
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,240
Maybe 0 sitting over there.

123
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,980
We have to be less
than minus 4.

124
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,820
Remember, we can ever be equal
to minus 4 because that

125
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,240
would make this undefined.

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,390
So we have to be less than
minus 4, so we don't

127
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,010
include minus 4.

128
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,490
We're less than minus 4,
but we have to be greater

129
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,670
than or equal to 11.

130
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,730
So we can't go less than
11, but we include the 11

131
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,630
because this is greater
than or equal to.

132
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,820
So anything in this, where I've
shaded it in-- anything on this

133
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,960
range will satisfy that
equation over there.

134
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,920
Now let's do it the other way.

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,460
Let's do it where we-- the
numerator and denominator

136
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,830
both have to be
positive or negative.

137
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,530
Let's see if we can do the
same problem that way.

138
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,330
So let me rewrite it down
here, maybe in a new color.

139
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,880
So the same problem.

140
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,370
x minus 3 over x plus 4 is
greater than or equal to 2.

141
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,410
Now, in order to do that
reasoning that I did in the

142
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,330
first video, remember the first
video I said, well, it's a

143
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,060
divided by b is greater than 0.

144
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,470
Either both of these are
positive or both of

145
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,520
these are negative.

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,450
But this only worked when
we had a 0 over here.

147
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,180
But we don't have a 0 here we
have a 2 so we can't at least

148
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,120
immediately do that rationale.

149
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
But maybe we can if we
subtract 2 from both

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,650
sides of this equation.

151
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,740
So let's do that.

152
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:12,610
So you have x minus 3 over x
plus 4 minus 2 is greater

153
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,330
than or equal to 0.

154
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,420
Just subtract a 2
from both sides.

155
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,510
I can add or subtract without
messing up the inequality.

156
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,460
Never have to worry about that.

157
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,630
It's only when you multiply
by negatives that you

158
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,380
swap the inequality.

159
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,120
And now, what is this?

160
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,160
You know, this doesn't look
like a rational expression.

161
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,100
But I can rewrite
minus 2, right?

162
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,930
Minus 2 is the same thing
as minus 2 times x

163
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,640
plus 4 over x plus 4.

164
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,380
This is minus 2 times 1.

165
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,640
This is the same thing.

166
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,925
And this is the same
thing as minus 2x plus--

167
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,540
let me be careful.

168
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:54,020
This is the same thing as minus
2x minus 8 over x plus 4.

169
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,680
This right here is the exact
same thing as minus 2.

170
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,420
I just multiply it times
x plus 4 for x plus 4.

171
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,300
Let's write it this way
because then we can add them.

172
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,620
So if we write that way, so I
have x minus 3 over x plus 4.

173
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,960
And I wrote it that way so I
have a common denominator.

174
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,900
And then I have plus minus
2x minus 8 over x plus

175
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,250
4 is greater than 0.

176
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,255
I have a common denominator.

177
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,690
That was my whole
point of doing this.

178
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,590
And so I have a denominator of
x plus 4 and then when you add

179
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,720
these two things you
get x minus 2x.

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,340
That's a minus x.

181
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,120
And then you have minus 3
minus 8-- that's minus

182
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,410
11-- is greater than 0.

183
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,050
So now I simplify the problem
into something like this.

184
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,430
So there's two situations.

185
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,710
Oh, let me be very careful.

186
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,010
This was greater than or equal.

187
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,900
This must be greater
than or equal.

188
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,370
Don't want to lose that
little equal sign.

189
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,190
That was the whole
point of this problem.

190
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,370
So now I'm ready to
operate just like this.

191
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,370
Actually, before I even
do this, let's get one

192
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,430
thing out of the way.

193
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,966
Let's be very clear.

194
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:08,960
x can never be
equal to minus 4.

195
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,930
Because if x is equal to minus
4, this whole statement-- that

196
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,960
original problem is undefined.

197
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,850
So let's just write that first.

198
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,475
You know, we could have
written that from the get-go.

199
00:09:16,475 --> 00:09:19,460
x cannot be equal to minus
4, for any solution.

200
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,370
That will make this
expression undefined.

201
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,570
Now, we have this and we saw in
the first video and we saw

202
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,030
right there that there's
two situations.

203
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,600
Either both of these
are positive.

204
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,070
So they're either both
positive, so minus x minus 11

205
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,090
is greater than or equal to 0.

206
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,560
This could be equal to 0.

207
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,740
Actually, if this is equal
to 0, then this whole

208
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,570
thing is going to be true.

209
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:51,220
So either that is greater than
or equal to 0 and this right

210
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,980
here is greater than 0.

211
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,460
It can't be equal to 0.

212
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,110
And x plus 4 is greater than 0.

213
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,650
That's the situation where
both of them are positive.

214
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,510
Or they're both going
to be less than 0.

215
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,820
And I'm running out of space.

216
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,480
Or minus x minus 11 is
less than or equal to 0.

217
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,850
And-- I'll write and like that.

218
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,780
And x plus 4 is less than 0.

219
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,470
Remember, it can't
ever equal 0.

220
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,130
So they're either both
positive or both negative.

221
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,810
That's the only way they we're
going to get something.

222
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,680
Well, the numerator can be
equal to 0 because this

223
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,720
thing can equal 0.

224
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,150
Or they're both positive to
get something positive.

225
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,840
Or they're both negative, so
that when you divide a negative

226
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,780
by a negative you still
get something positive.

227
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,030
So let's look at these two
situations and see if we get

228
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,540
any solutions that make sense.

229
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,180
So right here, if we add x to
both sides of this equation we

230
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,830
get minus 11 is greater
than or equal to x.

231
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,200
Or another way you could
say it, is x is less than

232
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,820
or equal to minus 11.

233
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,080
I just swapped these two sides.

234
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,500
And then here, if we add minus
4-- if we subtract 4 from

235
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,510
both sides we get x is
greater than minus 4.

236
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,750
But once again, this
makes no sense.

237
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,300
There's no way that I
can have-- remember

238
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,710
there's an and here.

239
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,670
Both of these have to be true.

240
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,160
There's no x that is
greater than minus 4

241
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,740
and less than minus 11.

242
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,630
So this right here,
there's no constraints.

243
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,560
So both of these can never be--
both the numerator and the

244
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,820
denominator can never both be
positive at the same time

245
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,320
because in order for them both
to be positive you get an

246
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,890
impossible constraint to fill.

247
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,720
So let's look at the situation.

248
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,840
The other situation is when
they are both negative.

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,970
When both this numerator
and this denominator

250
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,840
are both negative.

251
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,040
Let me be clear.

252
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,610
You can't make a statement
about these two not

253
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,550
being positive.

254
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,450
These two things can
ever be positive.

255
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,390
Remember, because we had to get
the 0 here in order to use

256
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,940
this logic to begin with.

257
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,310
So the fact that when we tried
to figure out x's that would

258
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,810
make both of these positive, we
got a nonsensical, impossible

259
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,890
to fill constraint, tells me
that both this numerator and

260
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,550
this denominator can never both
be positive for any given x.

261
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,860
Now let's see if they
can both be negative.

262
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,800
So for both of them to be
negative or the numerator

263
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,410
could also be equal to 0.

264
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,130
If we add x to both sides
of this we get minus 11 is

265
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,890
less than or equal to x.

266
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,560
Or we could say that x is
greater than or equal to minus

267
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,280
11 just swapping around.

268
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,390
Over here, if we subtract
4 from both sides we have

269
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,250
x is less than minus 4.

270
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,210
And-- and this is an and.

271
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,430
So x has to be greater than or
equal to minus 11 or less than

272
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,850
minus 4, which is exactly what
we came up in the last problem.

273
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,660
I can draw the
number line again.

274
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,720
We have to be greater than
or equal to minus 11.

275
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,860
So that's minus 11 there.

276
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,890
We could be equal to it or
greater than, but we have

277
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,250
to be less than minus 4.

278
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,860
So this is minus 4.

279
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,380
We can't even be equal to minus
4, that'll make our denominator

280
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,070
undefined or our whole
equation undefined.

281
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,590
It will make our denominator 0.

282
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,140
And so this is our
solution set.

283
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,460
Anything right here that I've
shaded in, including minus 11,

284
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,220
but not including minus 4.

285
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,530
So if you could get this
problem I think you can handle

286
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,270
pretty much any rational
equation problem.

287
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,110
Hope you enjoyed that.
