1
00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:04,019
We're asked to divide and simplify.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,587
And we have one radical expression over another radical expression. The key

3
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:11,937
to simplify this is to realize I have the principal square root of x

4
00:00:11,937 --> 00:00:15,820
over the principal root of y, this is the same thing

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,871
as the principal root of x over y.

6
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:23,420
And this really comes out of the exponent properties. If I have two things,

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,337
that I take to the some power, and taking the principal root is the same thing as taking it to the

8
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:31,170
one-half power. If I'm raising them to some power, and then

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,305
dividing, that's the same thing as dividing first, and then raising them

10
00:00:35,305 --> 00:00:39,020
to that power. So let's apply that over here.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,656
This expression over here is going to be the same thing as the principal root,

12
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:46,937
the principal - it's hards to write a radical sign that big - the principal root of

13
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:54,537
sixty x-squared y over forty-eight x.

14
00:00:54,537 --> 00:00:58,670
And then we can first look at the coefficient terms, or the coefficients of, each of

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,455
these expressions, and try to simplify that. Both the numerator and

16
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:06,354
and the denominator is divisible by twelve, sixty divided by

17
00:01:06,354 --> 00:01:10,554
twelve is five, forty-eight divided by twelve is four.

18
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:13,887
Both the numerator and denominator is divisible by x.

19
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:17,904
X-squared, divided by x is just x.

20
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:21,921
X divided by x is 1. Anything we divide the numerator by, we have to divide the

21
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:25,886
denominator by, and that's all we have left. So, if we want

22
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:33,256
to simplify this, this becomes, this is equal to, -the- -the-

23
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:34,764
Make the radical sign.

24
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,962
And then we have five-fourth's,

25
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:41,739
five-fourth's

26
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,742
And actually we can write it in a slightly different way, but I'll write it this way, five-fourth's, and we have

27
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:49,663
nothing left in the denominator other than that four, and in the numerator we have an x, and we have

28
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:54,051
a y. We have an x and we have a y.

29
00:01:54,051 --> 00:01:57,766
And, now, we could it just like that,

30
00:01:57,766 --> 00:02:01,743
but we might want to take more things out of the radical sign. And so one possibility

31
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,570
that you can do, is that you can say that this is really the same thing as

32
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,032
this is equal one-fourth times five, times five xy,

33
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,806
all of that under the radical sign,

34
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:16,306
and this is the same thing as the square root of, or the principal square root of,

35
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:18,989
one-fourth times the principal root of

36
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:23,923
five xy, and the square root of one-fourth. If you think about it, that's just

37
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,522
one-half times one-half. Or another way you could think about it is, this is the same thing,

38
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,520
this right here is the same thing as -

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,919
So you could just say that this is one-half, one-half times one-half is one-fourth.

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:38,085
Or if you don't realize it's one-half, you say, hey, this is the same thing as the square root of one over

41
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:42,163
the square root of four, and the square root of one is one,

42
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,152
and the square root - the principal root of four is two, so you

43
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:49,554
get one-half once again. And so if you simplify this right here to one-half,

44
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:53,770
then the whole thing can simplify to one-half times

45
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,634
the principal root.

46
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,895
I'll just write it all in a orange, times the principal root of

47
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:03,487
five xy, and there's nothing else that you can really take out of the radical time here.

48
00:03:03,487 --> 99:59:59,999
Nothing else here is a perfect square.
