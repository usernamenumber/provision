1
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:13,372
In many ways the artist's materials are what the musical notes are for a composer

2
00:00:13,372 --> 00:00:19,858
the artist brings together a desperate group of materials, assembles them into a composition

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:22,955
and what we see of that composition is on the canvas

4
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:31,204
and just the same way as the conductor's job is to take the set of notes and make some sense of the unruly orchestra

5
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:36,941
a restorer's job is to take the set of materials which has gone through a lot

6
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:41,758
of transformations since it was applied by the artist and make some sense of it

7
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:49,688
as conservators we have a variety of tools that have been adapted to tell us about

8
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:57,254
to give us clues about what the author may have had in mind when he was creating a particular image

9
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,864
This is 'The Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharis'

10
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:08,623
which was painted by Jacques-Louis David in 1818 when he was working in exile in Brussels

11
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:12,844
We're looking at the detail of the painting with a technique called infrared reflectography

12
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:17,454
which involves taking a camera that has been equipped with an infrared sensitive tube

13
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:23,534
and seeing the reflective abilities of different materials, different pigments in the infrared light range

14
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:28,540
If we take a close look at this area of the painting when we look at it with infrared

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:38,097
what we see is that David went to the trouble to block in the figure in the nude underneath the drapery and deliberately clothed him

16
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:44,290
David was trained as an academic painter, academic painters in France were trained from a very young age

17
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:49,981
to draw and study the nude and one of the reasons you do that is so you can get a real sense of form

18
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:56,263
not just the surface of the skin but the bone and the muscle that's underneath

19
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,289
When you walk through the galleries there are couple of things that you are not aware of

20
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,431
One is the fact that the picture has a history, it has a history from the time that it left the easel

21
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:11,398
when all sorts of things began to happen to it

22
00:02:11,737 --> 00:02:16,675
This is a painting by an early 19th century German painter named Caspar David Friedrich

23
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:20,291
who is an extremely rare artist in this country

24
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:28,585
When I first saw the painting at the auction house it was in a somewhat disheveled state

25
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:37,040
it had a fairly discolored varnish on the surface and more importantly it had a large hole in this part of the painting

26
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:45,626
What I did do was to repair the hole from the back, glue some new pieces of fabric just to the edges of the painting

27
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:48,009
which allowed me to re-stretch it onto the strecher

28
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:54,039
and then I have prepared the stretcher with yet another piece of fabric and then the whole package was put back together

29
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:58,267
so from the front you really can't tell that anything has happened

30
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:08,326
So the challenge in the restoration was to take care of the structural anomalies, this hole in the sky

31
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:15,454
but to do the work in such a way that my presence would be as invisible as possible

32
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:21,605
so that all that was left in the end was the artist's voice speaking to you directly

33
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:26,040
We have been able to look at this painting with infrared reflectography

34
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,582
and underneath the surface is an extraordinarily elaborate plan

35
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:38,494
These trees in the distance which have a kind of misty quality, were laid in in very elaborate, precise detail

36
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:42,026
and then the paint actually played the role of the mist

37
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:49,455
Imagine a late afternoon, early evening when the mist begins to rise from the fields

38
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:52,456
Friedrich literally laid in the mist, laid in the paint

39
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,705
the same way that the mist would have travelled into the field

40
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:59,123
and that's one of the reasons that this illusion of a tree in the mist in the distance

41
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:02,981
compared to the clarity of tree in the foreground is so successful

42
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:08,967
because he's used the paint almost to imitate the natural progression of the atmosphere

43
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:18,097
What appear to be the essence of simplicity and purity is often the result of a tremendous wrestle and struggle with materials

44
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:24,872
Paint is a very unruly and a difficult substance to handle and it's very hard to make it do what you want it to do

45
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:34,872
and one of the reasons that artists are such geniuses is because they are able to take a virtually unmanageable material and make sense of it

46
00:04:34,872 --> 00:04:41,485
make it speak, make it say something reflect some inner beliefs and feelings that they have

47
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:48,941
and that's a tremendous skill and talent and gift which is why we appreciate these things today
