1
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:01,705
What we have here is a simulation created

2
00:00:01,705 --> 00:00:03,650
by Peter Collingridge

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,273
in response to one of our computer science challenges

4
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:10,276
so, how many particles might interact gravitationally

5
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,694
and the whole point of this is to get an intuition

6
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:16,044
for how galaxies form, why they have

7
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:17,039
the structures they have

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,777
why solar - how solar systems form and how

9
00:00:18,777 --> 00:00:21,513
they have the structures they have and how

10
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:24,047
gravity alone can kind of define that structure

11
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:25,781
and what's really interesting about the simulation

12
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:28,038
besides the fact that it's just mesmerizing

13
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:28,975
and extremely cool

14
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,528
where it shows the particles collide, get

15
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:31,929
once they get to a certain critical mass

16
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,577
-you see that they get colored yellow-

17
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:34,979
maybe to indicate that they

18
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:35,777
are now a star

19
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,914
-fusion can now occur-

20
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,433
and you can zoom in at different levels

21
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:41,979
to really see how the different particles

22
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,837
, the different masses are interacting

23
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,634
and you can actually rotate

24
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:46,985
you can actually rotate

25
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,104
that to see a little bit clearer

26
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,043
this is kind of looking

27
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,313
kind of right on top of it

28
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,717
to see how they are interacting

29
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:53,688
It's a three dimensional simulation

30
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:54,843
so it's a very rich way

31
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,577
of thinking about these

32
00:00:57,577 --> 00:00:58,855
And what's exciting for me

33
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:01,355
it's highly dependent on what the initial

34
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,107
conditions are

35
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:03,246
and in an earlier version

36
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:04,369
of Peter's simulation

37
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:06,376
he did not give

38
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,312
eh...give a net angular momentum

39
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:09,048
to the system

40
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:10,186
and so you do not have as

41
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:11,580
as much of, kind of the planet- satellite

42
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,777
or as much of the disc structures forming

43
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:16,635
although right here,

44
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:22,437
there does seem to be a dominant plane

45
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:23,311
in this scenario

46
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:26,369
and, what's exciting is, here

47
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,439
we have a binary system

48
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,191
sometimes you restart it

49
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,854
you might not have a binary system

50
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:31,992
depending on the initial conditions

51
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,580
you might have something that starts

52
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,188
to look like the Milky Way

53
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:36,643
sometimes you might have something that

54
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:37,937
looks very different than the Milky Way

55
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:39,236
and it really gives us clues

56
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:40,176
of why we see

57
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:41,709
such diversity, specially in...when

58
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:43,108
we're looking at galaxies

59
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,114
the structure of galaxies, that is

60
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,519
highly dependent on initial conditions

61
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,445
One can argue that our own solar

62
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,038
system did have some net

63
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:52,519
initial angular momentum

64
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,176
because the current theory, it was...

65
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,047
-what really canalized nearby supernova,

66
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,267
that sent a shockwave and

67
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:01,052
allowed the dust that would form

68
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:02,774
our Solar System to reach a

69
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,312
critical mass and start to

70
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,585
condense into the Sun and the planets

71
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:09,054
and so, this isn't, in my mind,

72
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,640
a too unrealistic of a scenario

73
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,243
and it's really cool to look at

74
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:14,268
and it really gives you a sense of thing

75
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,382
you already see a binary star

76
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:16,862
orbiting around each other

77
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,509
or orbiting around the center of mass

78
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,313
which kind of looks like

79
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:19,974
around each other

80
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,023
and then this star right over here has

81
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,240
it's own kind of captive planet

82
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,115
that it's just rotating around it

83
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,368
you can see it a little bit clearer

84
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:28,768
if we had a very, at least

85
00:02:28,768 --> 00:02:30,445
from this perspective, a very close range

86
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:32,056
we cann zoom in a little bit more

87
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,352
to see it a little bit better

88
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:35,710
this has a satellite but

89
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,770
then they are also kind of dancing

90
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,530
around each other

91
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,050
So it's a really fascinating, a really

92
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,943
fascinating simulation, I can really

93
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,777
stare at this and play with it

94
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:43,530
for days

95
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,182
and I encourage you to

96
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:44,982
play with it, restart it, see how

97
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,945
the initial conditions or

98
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:48,199
what type of solar systems or

99
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,602
galaxies you might end up with

100
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,652
or wether they form discs,

101
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,201
wether you habe binary systems or not

102
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,609
and if you have planets with satellites

103
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,723
And then, if you are more advanced,

104
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:57,984
actually play with the code

105
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,181
and see if you can

106
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:00,236
really change the initial conditions,

107
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:02,862
the starting velocities of things

108
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,187
the number of particles of things

109
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,441
the distribution of mass

110
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,579
that you start off with,

111
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,050
the angular momentum that

112
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,986
you start off with

113
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,609
and see how that might change

114
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,967
the structure of the universe

115
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:15,436
that you create, and an anotation

116
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:16,703
to this video that links directly

117
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:18,516
to this simulation; and I'll also

118
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,373
put the link inside of the description

119
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:22,380
So: have fun; I can literally spend hours

120
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,517
with this, it is fascinating, fascinating module

121
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:26,437
that he's created,

122
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,866
we zoom in and out and I really thank

123
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,382
Peter Collingridge for this

124
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:31,441
incredible contribution.
