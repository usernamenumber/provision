1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:06,038
This right here is a simulation that was created by Peter Colengredge

2
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:10,976
Using the 'Kahn Academy Computer Science Scratchpad' to better understand

3
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:17,975
why we divide by 'n-1' when we calculate an unbiased sample variance.

4
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:20,646
When we are in an unbiased way trying to estimate

5
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,852
the true population variance.

6
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:25,573
So what this simulation does is at first it constructs a

7
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:29,770
population distribution, a random one and every time you go to it

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,100
there'll be a different population distribution. This one has a population of

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,186
383 and then it calculates the parameters for that population directly

10
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:42,366
from it, the mean is 10.9, the variance 25.5.

11
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:47,710
and then it uses that population and samples from it and it does samples of size

12
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,902
2, 3, 4, 5 all the way up to 10 and it keeps sampling from it, calculating the statistics for those samples

13
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:58,703
so the sample mean and the sample variance, in particular the biased sample variance and

14
00:00:58,703 --> 00:01:01,771
it starts telling us some things about this that give us some intuition and

15
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,521
you can actually click on each of these and zoom in

16
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:08,437
to really be able to study these graphs in detail.

17
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:11,189
So I've already taken a screenshot of this and put it in my

18
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:20,312
doodle pad, so I can really delve into some of the math in theintuition what this is showing us.

19
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:26,040
So here I took a screenshot and, you see, for this case right over here

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,101
the population was 529, population mean was 10.6

21
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:35,847
and down here in this chart he plots the population mean

22
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:40,016
right here at 10.6 and

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,709
over there you see that the population variance is at 36.8 and

24
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,708
right here he plots that right over here.

25
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,023
36.8.

26
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:51,022
So this first chart in the bottom left tell us a couple of interesting

27
00:01:51,022 --> 00:02:01,038
things and just to be clear this is the biased sample variance that he's calculating.

28
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:06,768
So he's calculating it. That is being calculated for each of our data points,

29
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:11,038
so starting with our first data point in each of our samples, going to nth data point

30
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,600
in each of the samples, we're taking our data point, subtracting out the sample mean

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,642
squaring it and dividing the whole thing not by n-1, but by lower case n.

32
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,041
And this tells us several interesting things.

33
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,369
The first thing is shows us is that the cases where we were

34
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:34,172
significantly underestimating the sample variance, when we're getting sample variances

35
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:39,189
close to 0, these are also the cases or they're

36
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,519
disproportionately the cases where the means for those samples are way far off

37
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
from the true sample mean or you can view that the other way around

38
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,506
the cases were the mean is way far off from the sample mean

39
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:58,708
it seems like you're much more likely to underestimate the sample variance in those situations.

40
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:03,931
The other thing that might pop out is the realisation, that the pinker dots are the ones for

41
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:09,041
smaller sample size, while the bluer ones are of a larger sample size.

42
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:16,702
And you see, here, these two little, I guess the tails, so to speak, of the hump

43
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:22,042
that at these ends you disproportionately, it's more of a reddish colour

44
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:27,270
that most of the bluish or the purplish dots are focused right in the middle

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,901
right over here, that they are giving us a better estimate, there

46
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,773
are some red ones over here and that's

47
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:34,515
why it gives us that purplish colour but here on these

48
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,770
tails it's almost purely some of these red, by and then

49
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,968
happens to get a little blue one, but this is disproportionately far more red.

50
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:46,370
Which really makes sense: when you have a smaller sample size,

51
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,310
you're far more likely to get a sample mean that is a bad estimate

52
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,309
of the population mean, it's far from the population mean and

53
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:58,938
you're more likely to significantly underestimate the sample variance.

54
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:04,100
Now these next chart really get's to the meat of the issue, because

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,511
what this is telling us is that for each of these sample

56
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,600
sizes, so this right over here, for sample size 2, if we keep

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,103
taking sample size 2 and we keep calculating the biased sample size variance

58
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:18,854
and dividing that by the population variance and finding the mean over all of those

59
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:19,926
you see

60
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,434
that over many, many, many trials, many, many samples of size 2

61
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:27,970
that the biased sample variance over population variance it's approaching half

62
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,104
of the true population variance

63
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:38,302
With sample sizes 3 it's approaching two thirds, 66,6%, of the true population variance

64
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:45,106
When sample size is 4 it's approaching three fourths of the true population variance.

65
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:48,772
So we can come up with a general theme of what's happening:

66
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:55,643
when we use the biased estimate, we're not approaching the population variance,

67
00:04:55,643 --> 00:05:01,440
we're approaching n-1, let me write this down, we're approaching

68
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,100
n-1 over n times the population variance.

69
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,645
When n was 2 this approached one half, when n is 3 this is two thirds, when

70
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,370
n is four this is three fourths, so

71
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,106
this is giving us a biased estimate.

72
00:05:18,106 --> 00:05:21,642
So how would we unbias this?

73
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:27,371
Well, if we really want to get our best estimate of the true population variance, not

74
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,962
n-1 over n times the population variance

75
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:34,750
we would want to multiply, let me do some of the colour I haven't used yet,

76
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,038
we would want to multiply times n over n-1.

77
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:43,641
We would want to multiply n over n-1 to get an unbiased estimate.

78
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:50,189
Here, these cancel out and we're left with just the population variance, that's

79
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,438
what we want to estimate and here, over here,

80
00:05:54,438 --> 00:06:01,644
you are left with our unbiased estimate of population variance.

81
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:05,044
Our unbiased sample variance, which is equal to

82
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:07,771
and this is what we see, what we saw in the last several videos, what you see

83
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:12,685
in statistics books and it's confusing why and hopefully Peter's simulation

84
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:18,442
gives you a good idea of why, at least convinces you that this is the case.

85
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:23,640
So you would want to divide by n-1.
