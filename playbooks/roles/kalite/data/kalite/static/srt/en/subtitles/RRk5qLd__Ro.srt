1
00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:07,664
We've got 6798 minus 3359.

2
00:00:07,664 --> 00:00:09,940
So let's see how far we can get with the subtraction.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,027
So immediately when we're going to the one's place, we're going to subtract a 9 from an 8.

4
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:17,278
So we've immediately reached a little bit of a stumbling block.

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:21,921
And to see what our options are here in terms of regrouping I'm going to rewrite both of these numbers.

6
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:29,956
So I'm going to rewrite 6798 literally. So this is equal to 6 thousand, that's this right over here,

7
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:47,789
that's six thousand, plus seven hundred, plus ninety, plus eight, minus all of this.

8
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,036
So minus... So I can do it... I can subtract each of the places so I can say this is going to be

9
00:00:53,036 --> 00:01:16,210
minus three thousand, minus three hundred, minus fifty, minus nine.

10
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,529
So there and here we're just explicitly showing what those place values represent:

11
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:25,126
A 6 in the thousand's place is 6000, a 3 in the hundred's place is 300.

12
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,377
Let's go back to our problem: We wanted to subtract a 9 from an 8.

13
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:34,554
Well, that's a little bit of a stumbling block, but what if we could take some of the value from some of these and give it to the 8?

14
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:40,033
In particular, we can go one place value up to the 90. And what if we would take 10 from the 90?

15
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,956
So let's do that. If we would take 10 from the 90 then 90 becomes 80.

16
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:50,204
But we don't want to change the value of the entire number so we're going to give that 10 to this 8.

17
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:56,705
So we're going to give that 10 to the 8. We're essentially regrouping right over here.

18
00:01:56,705 --> 00:02:02,046
And then that 8 can become an 18. Notice, I did not change the value of the number.

19
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:04,368
I just essentially changed how it represented it.

20
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:12,681
Instead of saying it 6000 plus 700 plus 90 plus 8, I'm just saying that 6000 plus 700 plus 80 plus 18.

21
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,374
Those are both going to give you 6798.

22
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:19,043
But now it becomes a little bit easier for us to actually subtract.

23
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:28,284
Now if we subtract, I have 18 minus 9 which is 9. I have 80, not 90 now.

24
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:34,043
I have 80 minus 50 which is 30.

25
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:39,802
And these are all positive so this is plus 9, this is a positive 30.
80 minus 50 is 30.

26
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:50,297
I have 700 minus 300 which is 400, and I have 6000 minus 3000 which is 3000.

27
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:56,300
So this is literally going to be 3000 + 400 + 30 + 9 or 3439.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,539
Now how would you do it if you didn't wanted to write it down like that?

29
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:03,625
And this is where you'll see a kind of shorthand notation, this is often called Borrowing.

30
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:13,471
So you see I've got an 8 in a one's place, I want to take a 10 from this 90 so it's going to become an 80.

31
00:03:13,471 --> 00:03:17,929
But we will just write it as 8 because it's in the ten's place - this 8 represents the 80.

32
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:26,633
And I'm going to give that 10 to the one's place so 10 plus 8 is 18.

33
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:40,462
And now you can subtract. 18 minus 9 is 9, 8 minus 5 is 3, 7 minus 3 is 4, 6 minus 3 is 3.

34
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:44,493
Three thousand four hundred and thirty nine.
