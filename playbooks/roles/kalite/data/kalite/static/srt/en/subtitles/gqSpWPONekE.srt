2
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:08,824
We're looking at a painting in the Fogg's collection.

3
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:11,378
It's a very famous self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh.

4
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:16,596
It's one of the toughest self-portraits I've ever seen.

5
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:20,331
Tough in terms of the color, tough in terms of all that

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:24,427
van Gogh is achieving at this moment in the late 1880s.

7
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:27,492
This is a painting that feels incredibly modern to me.

8
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:29,489
A willingness to take risks...

9
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:31,115
It's amazing in that way.

10
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,183
...is breathtaking.

11
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:35,527
This is a color that no artist ever used before.

12
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:38,034
And an entire background painted like that?

13
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:41,332
What nerve he had to take such radical steps!

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:45,790
My eye immediately goes to the structure of the painting,

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,437
the way in which he created the architecture of the face,

16
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:51,780
his use of line... look at the way in which the brushstrokes

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,842
wrap around, cascade around the eye and down the nose.

18
00:00:56,842 --> 00:01:00,883
It's almost like a river of paint as it flows across that face

19
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:02,508
and begins to define it.

20
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:05,016
But then it's not just brushwork at all.

21
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,088
It's the ways in which structure is actually built by color...

22
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:13,491
...By color, yeah, which I think was something that Cezanne was also thinking about.

23
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,556
Creating volume with color instead of a usual way with chiaroscuro...

24
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:21,357
But that the pinks and the purples that are in his temple,

25
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,033
and the way those modulate over to greens

26
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,634
is like nothing I've ever seen.

27
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:30,813
So he's treating the structure of his face, of his head, of his skull,

28
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,321
very much as if it was a kind of plastic medium.

29
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:38,058
He writes about this portrait that he's created eyes almost as if he was Japanese,

30
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,076
a reference to his love of East-Asian painting.

31
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:45,256
But this was a painting that was destined as a gift to Gauguin as part of an exchange.

32
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:51,200
The sort of utopian idea of a brotherhood of artists that was so important to him.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,823
And, of course, Gauguin also would have been very interested in East-Asian art.

34
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,724
This way that he's rendered the hair on his head, plastered down,

35
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:03,460
it's in strong contrast, visually, the way in which the coat feels

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,804
heavy and rough and oversized.

37
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:10,505
And then there's the very tight quality to the skin.

38
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:15,303
Well, I was noticing that too and what it was reminding me of was a skull.

39
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:22,454
The sense of the bones underneath his flesh and almost a kind of 'memento mori'.

40
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:27,052
Look at the browns and the blues, rust colors in his jacket.

41
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:33,507
This green, a sea of acid light that surrounds him.

42
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:36,072
He's an amazing colorist.

43
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,708
