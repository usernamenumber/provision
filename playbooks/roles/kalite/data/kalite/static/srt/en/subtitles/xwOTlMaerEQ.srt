In the last video on taxing hamburgers, I did a somewhat

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
artificial thing where I taxed hamburgers with

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an absolute dollar amount.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Typically, consumption taxes are a percentage of the

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
actual price of the goods. So, for example

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sales taxes might be eight percent or nine percent

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of whatever you are buying.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about how the supply curve as perceived

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by the consumers would look if we had a percentage tax.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now our government, instead of taxing one dollar per

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hamburger. let's say that their tax - and I'll make it big

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just to make it clear so that we can see the result of it,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say their tax is twenty percent of the price of the hamburger.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think what's going to happen.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just like we saw in the last video, in order for producers to

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
even think about producing that first hamburger, they need to

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
get two dollars per hamburger for it, because that's their

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
opportunity cost. Using those same inputs, that

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
same labour and resources, they could produce, their other opportunity would

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
give them at least two dollars, so you have

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to give them at least two dollars to focus on hamburgers.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And every incremental hamburger after that the opportunity

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cost goes more, because now they'll be using

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
things that are slightly less suited for making

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hamburgers, and maybe slightly more suited for making other things.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, if that very first hamburger. you need to get two dollars for it,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from a supplier point of view, but from the consumer point

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they can't just pay two dollars for it, they're going to have to
