1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:07,600
Let's have the molecule
sodium chloride.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Let's look at the
periodic table.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,870
Sodium, it's in alkali metal.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,770
It has one valence electron.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,190
It's in Group 1.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,800
And so when it only
has one, it really

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,710
wants to give it away.

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,350
And chlorine is a halogen,
and it's only one away.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,260
It just needs one electron to
have the full eight valence

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,400
electrons in its outermost
shell.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,159
So it really wants to
take 1 electron.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,900
And we've talked about this
story multiple times,

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,220
especially it early in the
chemistry playlist. So what we

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,410
know what's going to happen.

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,920
Sodium, since it wants to lose
an electron, is going to lose

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,810
its electron.

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,380
And it's going to give
it to chlorine.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,810
And chlorine is going
to gain it.

20
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,020
And so you're going to have a
situation where sodium is

21
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,950
going to have a plus 1 charge,
because it lost an electron.

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,900
And then chlorine will have a
minus 1 charge because it

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,480
gained an electron.

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,910
And then they'll be attracted to
each other because this one

25
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,570
is now a positive atom
and that one is

26
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,540
now a negative atom.

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,730
And just the Coulomb force will
make them want to be with

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,140
each other.

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,470
And we call this, of course,
an ionic bond.

30
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,700
I haven't taught you anything
you don't know yet.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,510
And in an ionic bond, you
literally had a loss of

32
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,190
electron from one compound
to another.

33
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,870
Now.

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,880
that's a very cut-and-dry
situation.

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,280
But we saw other situations
where wasn't quite as

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,300
cut-and-dry.

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,350
For example, H2O.

38
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,520
Where you have a oxygen-- but
you've seen this multiple

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,300
times already, if
you're watching

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,130
this playlist in order.

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,790
And it's bonded to
2 hydrogens.

42
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,710
But we know that oxygen is much,
much more-- in fact,

43
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,110
nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine
are the most electronegative

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,880
atoms, which means that they
like to hog electrons the

45
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,900
most. So when you have oxygen
bonded with pretty much

46
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,130
anything-- but in particular in
this case, hydrogen-- it's

47
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,910
going to to pull most of the
electrons in its direction.

48
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,930
So even though these are
covalent bonds, the hydrogen

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,250
is still sharing the
electrons that it

50
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,660
has bonded with oxygen.

51
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,940
The electrons spend most of
their time on the oxygen side

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,220
of this whole affair.

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,730
So you have a partial negative
charge on the oxygen end of

54
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,430
the molecule.

55
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,710
And you have partial positive
charges on the hydrogen.

56
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,920
And we talked about this.

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,100
And this is what leads
to hydrogen

58
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,560
bonding, and all of that.

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,990
What we're going to do here is
introduce-- it's almost an

60
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,010
intellectual tool.

61
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,160
We know that this isn't
an ionic bond.

62
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,880
We know that this is actually
a covalent bond, that this

63
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,630
atom is shared.

64
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,060
But it spends most of
its time at the more

65
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,170
electronegative atom.

66
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,170
That's why you have this partial
negative charge.

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,630
So we create this convention
called oxidation states.

68
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,400
Let me write that down.

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,925
And I'll clarify what the
word means in a second.

70
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:59,450
   

71
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,830
And this is essentially
assigning-- With an ionic

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,150
compound, you naturally assign
a charge, because each atom

73
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,510
really does have a charge.

74
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,000
But let's say we want to live in
a world where we don't like

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
this partial charge,
partial negative.

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,950
We want to say, look, if this
were, hypothetically, an ionic

77
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,740
bond, what would it look like?

78
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,430
Who would gain the
electron and who

79
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,960
would lose the electron?

80
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,070
So in the case of water, if you
were forced to say OK, who

81
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,310
gained the electron?

82
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,880
You'd say oxygen gained 2
electrons from the hydrogens,

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,840
and the hydrogens lost each
1 electron to the oxygen.

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,260
So the hydrogen would have a
plus 1 charge, each of them.

85
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,300
And then the oxygen would
have a minus 2 charge.

86
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,210
Now, I want to be very
clear with this.

87
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,840
This isn't what really
happened.

88
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,790
This is just our little
intellectual game that we're

89
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,550
playing called an
oxidation state.

90
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,590
It's going to be really useful
later to understand why some

91
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,700
reactions occur.

92
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,480
But I just want to
be very clear.

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,320
This is a hypothetical charge
if these were ionic bonds.

94
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,070
So you're just saying, whoever
is the more electronegative--

95
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,070
and remember, electronegativity,
it goes

96
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,340
from the bottom left
to the top right.

97
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,890
So these are the most
electronegative atoms, which

98
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,269
means they love to hog electrons
the most. These are

99
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,110
the least. Or you could also
call them the most

100
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,080
electropositive, which means
they like to give away

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,430
electrons the most.

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,800
So what you would do
is you say, OK.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,810
The more electronegative,
let's just say that they

104
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,710
actually get the electrons.

105
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,070
And that the more
electropositive atoms, they

106
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,140
give the electrons.

107
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,700
Even though we know that it's
something in between.

108
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,050
It's actually partial.

109
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,030
Now these numbers.

110
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,760
These hypothetical ionization
of these hydrogen molecules.

111
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,580
This is called their
oxidation number.

112
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,900
   

113
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:04,720
The oxidation number of hydrogen
in H2O is plus 1.

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,420
So we could write a plus 1 for
each of the hydrogens there.

115
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,040
And then oxidation number for
the oxygen is minus 2.

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,230
   

117
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,150
And the way we talk about it,
we say that the hydrogen

118
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:23,330
molecules here have
been oxidized.

119
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,700
And it's kind of like saying
that you've been-- In this

120
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,010
case, they were oxidized
by oxygen.

121
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,120
And this is actually a very
confusing point, or at least

122
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,210
it was to me initially.

123
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,500
Because when I first learned
about oxidation, I was like,

124
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,890
oh, that's what oxygen
does to things.

125
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,180
Because the word has the word,
oxygen, or at least the

126
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,910
beginning part of oxygen.

127
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,255
So I thought, oh, oxidation must
mean what oxygen does to

128
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,100
other atoms, which
means it takes

129
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,460
electrons away from them.

130
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,880
Usually it takes 2 electrons
for itself.

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,390
Maybe it took 1 from each of the
other atoms. So if you've

132
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,000
been oxidized, you've had
electrons taken away from you.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,530
And so you'll have a
positive charge.

134
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,190
Now, that interpretation
is only partially true.

135
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,550
The reality is it does not have
to be oxygen that's doing

136
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,840
the oxidation.

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,440
So for example, let me
do hydrogen fluoride.

138
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,650
   

139
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,060
H F.

140
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,250
I've shed my habit of writing
fluorine as Fl.

141
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,060
I've now remembered that its
elemental symbol is just F.

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,585
So hydrogen fluoride, if it was
in an aqueous solution,

143
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,860
it'd be hydrofluoric acid.

144
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,420
That's hydrogen here bonding
with fluorine, one of the most

145
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,980
electronegative atoms. So what's
going to happen here?

146
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,960
Once again, the reality is that
hydrogen is sharing--

147
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,550
it's a covalent bond
with fluorine.

148
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,190
But the electron spends most
of its time here, on the

149
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,630
fluorine atom.

150
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,130
So you're going to have a
partial negative charge here,

151
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,900
and a partial positive.

152
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,240
But we don't like this partial,
halfway game.

153
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,980
We want to say, look.

154
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,020
If this was, hypothetically, an
ionic bond, if one of these

155
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,300
people have to gain or
lose an electron, how

156
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,290
would it play out?

157
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,350
In that situation, this guy
likes to hog electrons more

158
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,610
than hydrogen does.

159
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,270
So the fluorine would gain an
electron and have an oxidation

160
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,000
number of minus 1.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,520
And the hydrogen would lose
an electron, and have an

162
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,950
oxidation number of plus 1.

163
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,480
In this case, hydrogen
has been oxidized.

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,590
   

165
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,140
And notice, there's no
oxygen to be seen.

166
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,620
So the way I think about it,
fluorine did to hydrogen what

167
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,890
oxygen would have done.

168
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,640
For example.

169
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,540
If I say that you've been
Bernie Madoff'ed.

170
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,250
Bernie Madoff might not be the
actual individual who's taking

171
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,870
your money and putting it into
a Ponzi scheme, but it would

172
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,870
mean that someone else is doing
the same thing that

173
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,240
Bernie Madoff would
have done to you.

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,010
So in the same way, even though
there's no oxygen here,

175
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,232
fluorine has oxidized
the hydrogen.

176
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:04,160
Now, I'll introduce another
word, and that's reduction.

177
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,310
Reduction is the opposite
of oxidation.

178
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,560
I'll write it in blue.

179
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,530
   

180
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,573
And this just means a
reduction of charge.

181
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:25,990
   

182
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,970
So in this hydrogen fluorine
molecule, or hydrogen fluoride

183
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,350
molecule, hydrogen has
been oxidized.

184
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,030
It's been oxidized because
electrons have been

185
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,000
taken away from it.

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,809
That's what oxygen would
have done to it.

187
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,950
And so it has, now,
a positive charge.

188
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,280
And its oxidation number
is plus 1.

189
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,900
Because exactly one electron
would have been taken away

190
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,930
from this in a hypothetical
ionic bond.

191
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,750
Now, fluorine has
been reduced.

192
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,370
   

193
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:03,040
Its oxidation state
was reduced by 1.

194
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,690
If there was no hydrogen
around, it

195
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,890
would've been neutral.

196
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,050
But now it has a
minus 1 charge.

197
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,110
Because in our hypothetical
world of there's no partial

198
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,830
charge, it's more
electronegative.

199
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,400
It took the atom from
the hydrogen.

200
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,900
So it has a minus 1 charge.

201
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,280
Its charge has been reduced.

202
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,880
Its oxidation state
has been reduced.

203
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,380
Your oxidation state is just
that hypothetical charge.

204
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,210
And that's how I think of it.

205
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,990
Reduction means reduction in
your hypothetical charge.

206
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,270
Oxidation means, what would
oxygen have done do you?

207
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,360
Which means it would've taken
away electrons, which would

208
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,410
mean you have a positive
charge.

209
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,640
But if you look in some
textbooks, or some teachers,

210
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,890
they'll give you a mnemonic.

211
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,790
   

212
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,250
Leo the lion says, GER.

213
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,310
I'll say, says, in small,
because it's really irrelevant

214
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,560
to the mnemonic.

215
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,250
   

216
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,370
And this is just a way of
remembering that Leo means

217
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:11,600
Losing Electrons is equal
to Oxidation.

218
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:22,590
And that Gaining Electrons
is equal to Reduction.

219
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,770
Now, to me, when you first said,
oh wait, I'm gaining

220
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,360
electrons, but I'm
getting reduced.

221
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
What's getting reduced?

222
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
What's getting reduced is
your charge, because

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,070
electrons are negative.

224
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,030
You're gaining something
with a negative charge.

225
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,380
So that's where the reduction
comes from.

226
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,550
Oxygen comes from the fact that
oxygen will normally make

227
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,820
you lose electrons.

228
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,230
It will normally take electrons
away from you, even

229
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,260
though oxygen might
not have anything

230
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,830
to do with the reaction.

231
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,560
Now, we can look at the periodic
table, and we can

232
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,290
guess, in most molecules, what
an oxidation state of a given

233
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,600
atom will be.

234
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,790
All of these guys are
alkali earth metals.

235
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,450
And this is really a review.

236
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,960
It's kind of taught
as something new.

237
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,710
But we know all of these guys.

238
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,920
They love to give up electrons,
because that makes

239
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,610
them stable.

240
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,560
Because they have this one
electron in their outer shell.

241
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,310
So they tend to have an
oxidation state of plus 1,

242
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,010
which means that they tend
to give away an electron.

243
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,670
For example, if I write
sodium chloride.

244
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,850
In this case, the oxidation
state is truly reflective of

245
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,480
their charge.

246
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,230
Its charge is equal to
its oxidation state.

247
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,460
It gave away an electron.

248
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,640
And that's true for all of the
alkali metals right here.

249
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,160
Remember, I don't include
hydrogen there.

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,810
Because hydrogen is a little
bit of a special case.

251
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,690
It could have been thrown here
on the periodic table.

252
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,000
Because it has one electron in
its outermost shell, which is

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
just its only shell.

254
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,870
But it's also happy to get two,
and have a configuration

255
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,500
like helium.

256
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,460
So you can almost view it
as it's very close to

257
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,610
completing its shell.

258
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,040
So it sometimes has alkali
metal-type properties.

259
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,930
And sometimes it has halogen
properties, where it wants to

260
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,400
gain electrons.

261
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,510
So hydrogen-- Let's say hydrogen
is bonding with one

262
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,740
of these guys, right?

263
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,450
So let's say you had
lithium hydride.

264
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:16,040
   

265
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,630
So in this case, lithium,
is right here.

266
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,720
It loves to lose
its electrons.

267
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,770
So it'll lose its electron.

268
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,780
So it'll have an oxidation
state of plus 1.

269
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,070
And it will lose its electron
to hydrogen.

270
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,060
Because hydrogen is more
electronegative than lithium.

271
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,110
Because hydrogen, you give
it 1 electron then it has

272
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,510
electron configuration
like helium.

273
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,230
So hydrogen will be minus 1.

274
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,610
In this situation, hydrogen
bonds with people roughly on

275
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,680
the left-hand side of
the periodic table.

276
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
So lithium-- just to review
our terminology.

277
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,270
Lithium was oxidized
by the hydrogen.

278
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,050
Hydrogen was reduced
by the lithium.

279
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,570
   

280
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,790
Its charge went down.

281
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,300
Their oxidation number?

282
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,310
Plus 1 for the lithium, minus
1 for the hydrogen.

283
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,860
What is the total sum of
an oxidation state

284
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,730
for a neutral molecule?

285
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,600
In this case, you add up the
charges and you get, oh, it's

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,210
equal to 0.

287
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,860
And that's a big takeaway.

288
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,680
Then, in general, if you have
a neutral molecule-- let me

289
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,930
write that down.

290
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,120
   

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,370
I'll just say neutral
compound.

292
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,410
   

293
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:42,730
Then the oxidation
states add to 0.

294
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,150
And if you have a non-neutral
compound, if you have a plus 1

295
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,830
charge, the oxidation states
of all of the molecules in

296
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,830
your compound are going to
add up to your charge.

297
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,680
   

298
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,050
Well, let me give
another example.

299
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,960
So in this case, I had hydrogen

300
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,330
bonding with these guys.

301
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,250
In that case, hydrogen is the
one that took the electron.

302
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,530
Let's say I had OH minus.

303
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:16,450
   

304
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,430
So hydrogen, in this case,
when it's dealing with

305
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,230
something that's not on the
left-hand side, when it's

306
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,640
dealing with a super
electronegative atom,

307
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,780
hydrogen's oxidation
state is plus 1.

308
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,030
Right?

309
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,390
   

310
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,660
Now, oxygen's typical oxidation
state, when it bonds

311
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,530
with almost everything else--
and I'll give a special case

312
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,770
in a few moments-- is minus 2.

313
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,190
Because it normally takes two
electrons from other things.

314
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,440
We saw that with the water.

315
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,010
Oxygen's oxidation state, in
most cases, is minus 2.

316
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,600
So even though it hasn't gained
two electrons here, we

317
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,340
would write its oxidation
number as

318
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,180
minus 2 for the oxygen.

319
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,420
And then you add up the
two oxidation states,

320
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,930
minus 2 plus 1.

321
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,400
Well, actually I'll
take that back.

322
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,640
Oxygen has gained an extra
electron because this is

323
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
already an ion.

324
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,500
So in this case, this OH, oxygen
has stolen an electron

325
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,280
from someone else.

326
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,150
Let me draw that.

327
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:23,260
And then oxygen normally only
has 1, 2, 3, 4-- so oxygen has

328
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,410
completed its valence shell.

329
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,970
So essentially, it took
an extra electron

330
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,900
from some place else.

331
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,430
So it definitely does have a
minus 2 charge in this case.

332
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,480
Oxygen has a minus 2 charge.

333
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,110
Hydrogen has a plus 1 charge,
because this electron was

334
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,000
taken from it by the oxygen.

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,605
And so the total charge of this
molecule is minus 2 plus

336
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,480
1, which is minus 1.

337
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,700
And that's why you have a
minus 1 charge on OH.

338
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
So you add up the oxidation
states, and you're going to

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,690
get the charge of the
atom under question.

340
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,280
Now, we already saw that most
of these guys have an

341
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,310
oxidation state of plus 1.

342
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,350
These guys here, the alkaline
earth metals, have an oxygen

343
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,370
state of plus 2, because they
like to give away two atoms.

344
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,950
We already saw hydrogen.

345
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,680
If they bond with people here,
they take the electrons.

346
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,100
So they get reduced.

347
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,160
So it has an oxidation
state of minus 1.

348
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,570
But if hydrogen bonds with these
guys on the right-hand

349
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,310
side, it gives away
the electrons.

350
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,350
So it would have an oxidation
state of plus 1.

351
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,280
We saw that with hydrogen
fluoride.

352
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,110
It would be the case
with hydrogen

353
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,940
chloride, hydrogen bromide.

354
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,280
You saw the case with water.

355
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,020
All of these cases, hydrogen is
the one that's giving away

356
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,740
the electrons.

357
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,500
So it gets oxidized.

358
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,390
And these guys get reduced, or
their the oxidizing agent.

359
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,990
Now, what about these
guys over here?

360
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,680
What about our halogens?

361
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,320
Well, they all like
to take electrons.

362
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,010
So their typical oxidation
state is minus 1.

363
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,170
Oxygen's typical oxidation
state?

364
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,410
We just saw it's minus 2.

365
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,580
And I'll show you an example,
which is really one of the few

366
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,100
cases where oxygen
doesn't have a

367
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,300
minus 2 oxidation state.

368
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,430
And then there's a lot of
these other elements, in

369
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,910
between, that can have multiple

370
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,270
different oxidation states.

371
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,599
And we'll see that in
a lot of examples.

372
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,060
But if you know that hydrogen
is plus or minus 1, if

373
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,020
hydrogen is bonding with these
guys, it's a plus 1. it gives

374
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,180
away electrons.

375
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,480
If it bonds with these
guys, it's a minus 1.

376
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,990
it takes the electrons.

377
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,960
If you know oxygen tends to take
two electrons, so it has

378
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,780
a minus 2 oxidation state.

379
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
And the halogens take one.

380
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,270
If you know that, you can
normally figure out all of the

381
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,920
other people in the compound.

382
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,390
So what I'll do is I'll leave
you there for now.

383
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,670
I realize I'm running
over time.

384
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,260
In the next video, we're going
to do some maybe more

385
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,160
difficult examples.
