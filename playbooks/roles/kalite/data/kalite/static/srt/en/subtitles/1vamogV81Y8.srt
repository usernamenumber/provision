1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,370
   

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,880
Now that we know some
trigonometry, let's use

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,270
that trigonometry to
solve some word problems.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,270
So let's get started
with-- This is exciting.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,370
This is a navigation problem.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,270
So I have a ship that needs to
go from point A to point B.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,140
So let me draw that.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,440
So I'm going from point
A, which is that

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,400
point, to point B.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,250
Let me draw a nice, big--
well not so big --triangle.

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,620
Big enough.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,130
There you go.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,040
Because I need space
to do my math.

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,460
So let me-- Let's see.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,750
So this is point A.

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,880
Point A I will draw in mauve.

17
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,560
Point A to point B.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,140
So this ship needs to go
from point A to point B.

19
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,470
And this problem tells us that
the distance between point A

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,455
and point B is 10 kilometers.

21
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,460
   

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,690
So this guy set sail and,
because of whatever reason.

23
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,520
He's a bad navigator or
the water is flowing

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,070
faster maybe upwards.

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,670
Maybe the water's flowing
in this direction.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,340
Let me draw that in blue to
show which direction the

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,610
water-- Say the current is
flowing in that direction.

28
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,490
And he ends up off track.

29
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,890
He actually ends up, after
5 kilometers-- So he

30
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,120
travels for 5 kilometers.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,220
Let me do that in blue-green.

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,380
He travels for 5 kilometers and
after 5 kilometers, he realizes

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,640
that he has gone off track.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,550
And somehow-- I don't know
maybe using his astrolabe.

35
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,730
I don't really know what one
is, but that's what people use

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,980
when they're on ships to figure
out where they are I think.

37
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,760
--he realizes that he is
15 degrees off course.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,630
So what that means is that
he's-- Between the path he took

39
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,020
and the path he should've
took is 15 degrees.

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,540
At least that's my
interpretation of it.

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,690
So this is 15 degrees.

42
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,630
And, of course, he's traveled
5 kilometers in the

43
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,280
wrong direction.

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,960
15 degrees in the
wrong direction.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,750
So what he needs to know
is-- So this is-- Let

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,890
me draw a little ship.

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,670
So this is where
the ship is now.

48
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,560
That's my ship.

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,120
So now this guy, this poor poor
captain, he said so how far do

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,820
I still have to go
to get to point B?

51
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,150
So let me-- So he needs to know
how far is-- let me pick a nice

52
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,150
color --how far is this
distance right here?

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,640
   

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,510
This may just involve
some trigonometry.

55
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,920
So how can we figure
out this distance?

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,650
Well let's just break
down what we know.

57
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,000
And that's how I
do trig problems.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,480
I just keep messing around
with it until I get

59
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,260
the right answer.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,950
So let's see if we can tackle
this problem that way.

61
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,060
So what can we figure out?

62
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,610
We know this is 5 kilometers.

63
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,750
This side is 5 kilometers.

64
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,060
We know that this
is 10 kilometers.

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,380
We know this angle.

66
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,190
Well one thing I know I can
figure out is-- Let's just make

67
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,420
some right angles so we can
start using some trigonometry.

68
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,310
Let me draw a right angle here.

69
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,550
I just drop it straight down.

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,310
   

71
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,080
So can I figure out what
this side is right here?

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,110
Let me draw that in
a different color.

73
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,470
In this brown color.

74
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,700
Can I figure out what
this side right here is?

75
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,790
   

76
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,520
Well this side is
going to be what?

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,010
This is-- If we look at this
angle, this is adjacent to

78
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,860
the angle and this
is the hypotenuse.

79
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,410
So if we know the hypotenuse,
we know the angle, we want to

80
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,190
figure out adjacent, what
trig function should we use?

81
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,110
Let me write out--
down our SOH CAH TOA.

82
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,450
   

83
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,690
So we know the hypotenuse.

84
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,310
We want to figure
out the adjacent.

85
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,760
So what involves adjacent
and hypotenuse?

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,620
CAH, or cosine.

87
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,620
So we know that the cosine of
15 degrees-- so I'm going to

88
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,780
write over this just not to
waste space --cosine of 15

89
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,030
degrees is equal to
this brown side.

90
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,170
So let's just call
this-- I don't know.

91
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm just going to
call it x, right?

92
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,940
So this is equal to x over the
hypotenuse, over 5, right?

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,560
If we solve for x, we
get x is equal to 5

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,110
cosine of 15 degrees.

95
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,090
Maybe we made progress.

96
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,640
Maybe we didn't.

97
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,010
Let's keep trying.

98
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,490
All right.

99
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,140
Now let's see if we could
figure out this side

100
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,680
of this triangle.

101
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,640
Well this is, to this angle,
this is the opposite, right?

102
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,770
This is the opposite.

103
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,910
And we know the hypotenuse.

104
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,220
So what trig identity
should we-- trig

105
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,670
function should we use?

106
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,970
well if we know the opposite--
Well if we want to figure out

107
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,130
the opposite and we know
the hypotenuse and if

108
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:38,820
we know the angle.

109
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,050
So what trig function deals
opposite-- I was going

110
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,570
to say hypotenuse.

111
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,180
But anyway.

112
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,640
What trig function deals with
the opposite of the hypotenuse?

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,250
Well that's sine, right?

114
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,940
So the sine-- We call this y.

115
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:59,600
We know that y is equal to--
Well, doing it the same way,

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,050
sine-- 5 sine of 15 degrees.

117
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,020
I skipped a step, right?

118
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,660
Because we could say that sine
of 15 degrees is equal to the

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,510
opposite, y, over the
hypotenuse, over 5.

120
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,490
And then that step
takes us here.

121
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,200
We just multiply
both sides by 5.

122
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,960
You get y is equal to
5 sine of 15 degrees.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,620
So that's pretty cool.

124
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,500
We know this y.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,610
We know the x.

126
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,620
Can we figure out
what this length is?

127
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,570
Let me draw it in
yet another color.

128
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,020
Can we figure out what the
length of this side is?

129
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,050
Well we know from the
prompt that this whole

130
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,700
length is 10, right?

131
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,600
We know this whole
length is 10.

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,530
And we know that this little
part of it is x, which

133
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,690
is, we figured out is 5
cosine of 15 degrees.

134
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,810
So let's call this z.

135
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:59,410
We know that z is equal
to 10 minus x, right?

136
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,760
Because this whole thing is 10.

137
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,750
This thing is x.

138
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,700
So z equals 10 minus x.

139
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,630
And we already figured
out what x is equal to.

140
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,820
Z is equal to 10 minus this.

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,570
That's what x is.

142
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,935
We didn't even have to
use the variable x.

143
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,590
We could have just
written it like that.

144
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,850
So 10 minus 5 cosine
of 15 degrees, right?

145
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,720
That's this side.

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Z is equal to 10 minus 5
cosine of 15 degrees.

147
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,050
So we know z.

148
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,150
We know y.

149
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,470
This is a right triangle.

150
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,010
And we're looking for this
yellow side, whatever

151
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,110
we want to call it.

152
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,750
That's the answer
to the problem.

153
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,410
Well this is starting
to look easy.

154
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,990
This is just the
Pythagorean Theorem.

155
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,420
So let's just-- y squared plus
z squared is going to be equal

156
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,010
to our-- let's just call this.

157
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,460
I don't know.

158
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,640
Let's call this m.

159
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,550
Picking an arbitrary letter.

160
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,230
Let's call that m.

161
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,530
So y squared plus z squared is
going to be equal to m squared.

162
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,730
So we could just say-- Let's
just write that down.

163
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,770
I don't know why I picked m.

164
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,920
Really just to confuse
you, I think.

165
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,960
So m squared is equal to-- Well
what's y squared? y squared

166
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,510
is 5 sine of 15 degrees.

167
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,350
So it equals-- Let me
do it in that color.

168
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:20,540
5 sine of 15 degrees squared
plus-- What's z squared?

169
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,570
z is this, right?

170
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,830
z squared plus-- I'm running
out of space --10 minus 5

171
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,290
cosine of 15 degrees squared.

172
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,826
And now I just have
to simplify this.

173
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:38,060
And if you have a calculator
you could do this without

174
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,860
any simplification.

175
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,390
But I want to get it
as simple as I can.

176
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,030
So let me just-- So
what's this squared?

177
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,310
Well this is equal to-- Let me
draw a line here because I

178
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,580
don't want to get too messy.

179
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,590
But I need all of this space.

180
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,730
   

181
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,620
So this is equal to-- What
color am I using now?

182
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,520
This is equal to-- And
remember, this is m squared.

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,930
We're going to have to take the
square root of all of this

184
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,030
at the end to solve for m.

185
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,390
This is equal to 25 sine
squared 15 degrees, or sine

186
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,250
of 15 degrees squared.

187
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,240
That's just how you write it.

188
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,130
And then we do a little bit
of FOIL here to expand this.

189
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:27,170
So plus 100 minus-- this is
just expanding this expression

190
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:39,330
--minus 100 cosine of 15
degrees plus 25 cosine

191
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,740
squared of 15 degrees.

192
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,000
All I is I expanded.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,340
I said, well this whole
expression squared is equal to

194
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,460
this squared minus 2 times the
two things multiplied out.

195
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,580
So that's 100 cosine
of 15 degrees.

196
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,180
And then I just squared this
last term, which is plus

197
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,950
25 cosine of 15 degrees.

198
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,350
If that confused you, you
might want to review the

199
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,890
multiplying expressions.

200
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,580
So let's see if we can
simplify this further.

201
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,780
So if we take this term and
this term, we could simplify

202
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:14,610
that to 25 times sine
squared of 15 degrees plus

203
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,290
cosine squared of 15.

204
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,090
And you could skip all this and
just use a calculator and

205
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,150
figure out this exact value.

206
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,590
But I'm just going to keep
working on it just because

207
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,160
I like to get it as simple
as possible before I

208
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,630
use the calculator.

209
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,760
So that term and
that term are that.

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,120
And then it's plus this stuff.

211
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,450
Plus 100 minus 100 cosine
of 15 degrees, right?

212
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,020
And then-- What is the sine
squared of 15 plus the

213
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,320
cosine squared of 15?

214
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,500
That's one of our most
basic identities, right?

215
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,050
That's the Pythagorean
Identity.

216
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,690
Sine squared of x plus
cosine squared of x, or of

217
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,350
theta, is just 1, right?

218
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,000
So this term becomes 1.

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,130
And I'm running out of time.

220
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,420
So I will continue
in the next video.
