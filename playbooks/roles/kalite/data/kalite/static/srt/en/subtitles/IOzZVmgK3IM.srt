1
00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:03,631
Let's explore this notion of using something

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:08,300
other than actual physical gold as a unit of exchange.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,800
So let me draw my balance sheet.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,700
I'll draw it a little bit neater this time.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,600
So I built my building,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,154
my bank, my vault, whatever you want to call it.

7
00:00:17,154 --> 00:00:21,000
And I used 100 gold pieces to build it.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,838
This is just my bank's balance sheet - Bank of Sal.

9
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:28,696
So it's 100 gold pieces.

10
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,000
When I say 100 gold pieces, this is equity.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,891
Hopefully you're familiar with it by now.

12
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:36,491
But it's not like there're actually 100 gold pieces anywhere anymore.

13
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,691
I took these 100 gold pieces,

14
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:41,391
paid the builders of my vault-looking, temple-looking bank

15
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,191
and maybe they live someplace else

16
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:44,891
and they just took that gold with them.

17
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:48,191
So I'm just saying I have 100-gold-pieces worth of a building.

18
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,068
Maybe if I had to sell this,

19
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,091
someone else would give me 100 gold pieces for them.

20
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:54,091
And that's why I say I have 100-gold-pieces worth of equity.

21
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,591
Anyway, that's not the point of this video.

22
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,491
So I go, I tell everyone, hey, you can keep your money,

23
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,091
safe for your gold, safe with me.

24
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:06,591
So let's say that - I don't know - Citizen A says, “well,

25
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,291
this looks like a good bank,

26
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,791
and Sal, you've lived in this village all your life,

27
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,791
and I trust you and your ancestors.

28
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:18,191
So I'm going to deposit 500 gold pieces with you.”

29
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:23,291
So that becomes an asset in the bank.

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:27,891
500 gold pieces. I’m trying to draw it as neatly as possible.

31
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,999
Got the width off a little bit, but I think you get the idea.

32
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,991
The width shouldn't matter.

33
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,391
The height kind of represents the quantity.

34
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:37,391
So this guy - maybe it's my uncle -

35
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,691
- 500 gold pieces - deposits in my bank

36
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:43,376
because of this vault that I built seems a lot safer.

37
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:47,076
And I say, “well, do you want it all in your checking account, sir,

38
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:49,976
or would you like some cash back?” And he says, “oh, well,

39
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:54,076
I need some cash to just transact every day

40
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:58,076
and to buy, you know, supplies or food, et cetera.

41
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,038
So why don't you put 400 equivalent

42
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,338
in my checking account. ”

43
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:05,376
So let me draw that.

44
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,676
Let me do the cash back first.

45
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:09,676
Let's say I do 100 cash back first.

46
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:14,076
So then I have this liability here, of 100.

47
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:19,576
So it's 100 gold pieces’ equivalent of notes outstanding.

48
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,376
“N.O.” for notes outstanding.

49
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:25,976
And maybe I just hand him five 20s for that

50
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,899
as most ATMs today do.

51
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,976
But I just don't want to confuse things too much.

52
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,930
Remember, this is in my fictional world.

53
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,976
These aren't necessarily dollars just yet.

54
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:41,476
These are bank notes from the Bank of Sal, saying that

55
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:45,176
anyone who were to hand back one of these 20s to me

56
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,376
will get 20 gold pieces.

57
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,476
That's all it says.

58
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:51,076
I've signed them and I've made them hard to forge,

59
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,861
just because I don't want anyone printing these notes

60
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,676
and then coming to me and getting my gold pieces.

61
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:57,776
I only want the ones that I printed coming back to me.

62
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:59,168
But anyway, that depositor -

63
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:02,161
- so he got 100 gold pieces of notes

64
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:03,276
and that's what I've drawn here

65
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,376
and then the rest will just stay in his checking account.

66
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:09,876
So… checking account.

67
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,176
It's a liability for me, right?

68
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:13,676
Because he can at any point withdraw that checking account

69
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:16,600
and get back 400 gold pieces.

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,400
So 400 gold pieces for A's checking account.

71
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,546
A’s checking, called checking deposit -

72
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:24,546
- there are a bunch of ways you can write it,

73
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,300
but this is a liability for me.

74
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,700
These are my assets.

75
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,000
Fair enough.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Someone else who trusts A says – call him Person B - says,

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
“if it's good enough for A, it's good enough for B.

78
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,615
So let me put my money in this bank account as well

79
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,900
and I want to do similar type of transaction as A.”

80
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,000
Although maybe they don't have as much money.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,700
So let's say that they have - I don't know -

82
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
- let's say they have 200 gold pieces.

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,300
So let me draw that on the left hand side first.

84
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,900
200 gold pieces from Person B.

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,700
That looks like about 200.

86
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,500
And they want to half of it in cash

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,935
and half of it as a checking deposit account.

88
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:11,615
Let me do it like that. So it seems about it.

89
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:21,900
Half of will be 100 gold pieces for B's account.

90
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,800
And then we also give him some cash,

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,700
which are essentially bank notes in our current universe.

92
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
And let’s say he wants it all in 10s. So we give him -

93
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,100
- so let's say 100 gold pieces’ equivalent, notes outstanding,

94
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,300
and I'm going to hand him - let's say he likes it all in 1s.

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,100
I don't know. He likes the weight of the money; or

96
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,800
he has to - I don't know what he does with the $1 bills.

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,300
But 100 times a 1-gold-piece-denominated bank note, right?

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,208
I give him 100 of these.

99
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,800
Fair enough.

100
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,815
So let's explore a little bit about

101
00:05:06,815 --> 00:05:10,000
how some transactions can occur with A and B.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,300
Let's say A needs to buy an apple from B.

103
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,462
So let me draw this up here.

104
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:19,085
I don't want to run out of space.

105
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll draw it actually down here.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,231
So let's say I have Person A and I have Person B.

107
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:32,600
So B has an apple.

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,900
That's my drawing of an apple.

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,100
And Person A wants it and asks Person B,

110
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,200
“How much does an apple cost?”

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,000
And Person B says, “Well, an apple costs 2 gold pieces.”

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
So Person A says, “Well, that's a little high, but I'm hungry,

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,331
so I will give you two gold piece for it,

114
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:48,400
but I'll tell you what -

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
there's this new thing called a bank

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,100
and I don't have gold pieces

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
and I think you know what it's all about.

118
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,700
Instead, let me just give you these pieces of paper that

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,800
the bank says anytime I can go and trade for gold pieces.”

120
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
So Person B says, “That's fair enough.

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,100
I'm very familiar with that concept as well.”

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,800
So Person A gives Person B - so Person A has -

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
- maybe some of these weren't 20s,

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,900
maybe some of these were $2 bills or something -

125
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,100
Let me just say they were $1 bills.

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,700
So 1-gold-piece note - actually let's just make it -

127
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,908
- since he's got five 20s,

128
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:32,700
let's say he gives him a 20-gold-piece note.

129
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,800
I should draw it in green because that's the color that

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,585
I originally drew the 20 gold-piece notes - one of these.

131
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:38,900
He hands one of these over to Person B.

132
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,500
B hands over the apple to Person A

133
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,038
and he also hands over 18 of those $1 notes that he got.

134
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:51,335
$1 notes.

135
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:58,046
These were these notes here that Person B got.

136
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:01,400
Hands over 18 of these $1 notes, so times 18.

137
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,800
So as a matter of fact, you had two $1 notes switch hands

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,300
and an apple was exchanged.

139
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,900
And what's neat here are a couple of things.

140
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,500
One, no gold ever had to exchange hands.

141
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Gold is heavy

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,300
and you don't want to carry around a bunch of gold.

143
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,900
You're able to do very exact change in this situation.

144
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,800
You could imagine a world where gold is worth 20 times

145
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,400
your smallest unit of exchange you want.

146
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,431
So it would be very inconvenient to

147
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,000
have to break up little gold coins.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
In this case, our smallest unit of exchange is

149
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,400
a 1-gold-dollar bill or whatever you want to call it.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
But you could imagine - you could break these up -

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,285
- this bank could issue notes that are

152
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,523
a quarter of a gold piece or an eighth of a gold piece.

153
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:46,438
And that's a lot easier than actually cutting up gold pieces

154
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:48,900
and then having to put them all back together.

155
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
And of course,

156
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,000
these notes can then switch hands between people

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,200
as the economy needs, as it functions,

158
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,015
and the bank doesn't have to worry about anything

159
00:07:58,015 --> 00:07:59,700
and the gold doesn't have to be moved around.

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,500
So everyone is happy.

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,600
Let's say that that

162
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Person B actually wants to buy sth large from Person A.

163
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,900
Let's say Person B wants to buy – Person A is richer,

164
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,600
so let's say Person A is buying something from B.

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Let's say B is a home builder.

166
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Let me do that in blue.

167
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's say B is a home builder.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,500
And Person A is going to get him to build a house for him.

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,400
So he's going to say,

170
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
“Well, I'll pay you 200 gold pieces to build a house.

171
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,100
That's a huge amount of money.

172
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,400
I don't like walking around with that.

173
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
How about I write you a check?”

174
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
And Person B says, “Well, what is a check?”

175
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,700
“Well, a check,” Person A says, “is I just write you a note

176
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
and that essentially instructs the bank to transfer

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,531
that amount of gold pieces in my name to

178
00:08:47,531 --> 00:08:48,731
it being in your name.”

179
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:51,300
And Person B says, “Oh, that sounds reasonable enough.”

180
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
So Person B gives Person A a home,

181
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,592
works for weeks to build a house.

182
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:03,700
And then Person A writes B a check.

183
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
And now we're getting an introduction to checks

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
and the check will look something like this.

185
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Person A will fill out - it'll have A's name there

186
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,900
and it'll say “200 gold pieces please” and then A will sign it

187
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,100
and A will probably date it – 10, I don't know, 2008 and

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,900
then give it to B and then B can take it back to this bank.

189
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
And the bank will do the transfer - all the bank has to do is

190
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,315
take 200 gold pieces from here and put it there.

191
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,900
So this is all the bank has to do really.

192
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,400
Right now 400 gold pieces in A's name,

193
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,169
just take 200 of those and put them in B's name.

194
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:50,300
So now this is B's new share, which would be 100 plus 200,

195
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
so it's 300 gold pieces.

196
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,200
And then A's share has shrunk to just being this part right here.

197
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
But notice, the bank didn't have to do anything

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
except a little bit of paperwork.

199
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
200 gold pieces.

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,354
And that was useful

201
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,300
because you didn't have to exchange cash.

202
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
We talked about gold being dangerous to keep at home

203
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
because obviously someone could steal it.

204
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
It's also inconvenient because it weighs a lot -

205
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,400
it's hard to break up and carry around if you're doing a lot of it.

206
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
But cash is the same thing -

207
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
- these bank notes are also dangerous

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
because someone can steal them

209
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,000
and no one is keeping track of who has which bank notes,

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
so they're still something that's very stealable.

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,300
But a check was nice.

212
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
Because one, you could write a very large amount

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,200
and also, only if we're doing our authentication right,

214
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,900
Person A can write the check.

215
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,200
So it's not like someone could - in an ideal world,

216
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,069
someone could not have stolen A's checkbook

217
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:39,300
and signed for him

218
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,900
because hopefully this bank has A's signature on record

219
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,900
and can recognize when A has written a bad check;

220
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,508
or maybe, they'll even check with A to say

221
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:48,881
if something is a little bit suspicious.

222
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:53,900
But anyway, that's an introduction to banks notes

223
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,800
and checks. In the next video,

224
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,208
I'll talk about how we can use all of these notions

225
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,500
to actually lend money, also without giving out any gold.

226
00:11:00,500 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.
