1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,680
All right, we're now on problem
number 15 on page 463.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,050
Let's see, they have a chart.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:16,010
And it says, city and noon
temperature in Farenheit.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,260
So I'll just write
temperature.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,650
   

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:42,670
And city A is 50 degrees, B is
33, C is 27, D is t degrees, E

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:55,870
is 68 degrees, F is 44 degrees,
and G is 40 degrees.

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,610
All right.

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,100
Now, so the question says, the
table above shows the noon

11
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,580
temperature for seven cities
designated A through G.

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,890
All right, if the median noon
temperature-- so the median--

13
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,800
is 40 degrees, then the noon
temperature for city D could

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,120
be any of the following
except?

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,420
So the median means what?

16
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,920
It means the middle number.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,680
It means if we were to rearrange
all of these numbers

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,190
from smallest to highest, the
40 would be the middle.

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,140
So let's rearrange all the
numbers, I guess, except for t

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,110
from smallest to highest,
because we

21
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,450
don't know what t is.

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:44,630
So let's see, the smallest
is 27, then we go to 33.

23
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,240
Then we have 40.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,790
Then we have 44.

25
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,310
Then we have 50.

26
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,950
Then we have 68, right?

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,800
I should have written six
numbers down, and I wrote six

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,910
numbers down, right?

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,140
And they're saying
the median is 40.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,610
So in order for the median to
be 40, this needs to be the

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,050
middle number, right?

32
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,240
The middle number.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,070
That means there need to be just
as many numbers smaller

34
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,000
than 40 as there are numbers
larger than 40, right?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,460
Just the way I drew it right
now, it doesn't look like the

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,060
median, right?

37
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,690
Because there's only two numbers
less than it and

38
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,140
there's three numbers
greater that it.

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,470
So I think you see where
this is going.

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,750
t has to be someplace here.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,420
t has to be someplace less than
40 degrees in order for

42
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,890
40 to be the median number.

43
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,030
So let's see, it says-- and
actually, t could be less than

44
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,950
or equal to 40.

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,750
Because even if we had another
40 here, then 40 would still

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,770
be the median, right?

47
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,850
Because if you put all the
numbers in order-- you know,

48
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,870
you have seven numbers-- the
fourth highest number would

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,560
still be 40.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,310
So t has to be less than
or equal to 40.

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,640
So if we look at the choices,
A is 29, well

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,050
that satisfies it.

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,260
B is 35, that satisfies it.

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,220
C is 39, satisfies it.

55
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,440
D is 40.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,120
And then we look at E.

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,110
E is 42, so that does
not satisfy it, so

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,650
our choice is E.

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,600
All right, problem number 14.

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,780
This one looks exciting,
and I will do it

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,220
in an exciting color.

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,420
So let me see if I
can draw this.

63
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,290
So I have a line on the top and
then I have a line that

64
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,240
goes straight down like that.

65
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,650
   

66
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,330
And then this thing goes
something like this and it

67
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,570
goes something like this.

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,580
Can I draw this right,
draw this even.

69
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,460
And then it goes-- well, close
enough, I think, to what they

70
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,490
have on the drawing.

71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,850
And let me fill in all
the information.

72
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,790
So it says these are right
angles, this is a right angle.

73
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,400
The length of this is 6.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,420
The length of this is 6.

75
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,110
The length of this is 6.

76
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:16,680
And then it tells us that
these are 30 degrees.

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,750
And it says, what is the
perimeter of the figure above?

78
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,190
So in order to figure out the
perimeter-- we you know this

79
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,060
side, we know this side, we know
this side-- we need to

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,540
figure out these two
sides, right?

81
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,790
These two sides.

82
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,080
So once we know those,
then we're set.

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,460
And you could do some fancy
things here if you wanted to

84
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,600
go in the wrong direction.

85
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,490
But you'd get the right answer,
you could make a 30,

86
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,200
60, 90 triangle here and here
and figure out this side and

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,070
then figure out the hypotenuse
et cetera, et cetera.

88
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,030
But the real trick of this is
just kind of seeing the

89
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,020
negative image here.

90
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
Trying to see kind of what
hasn't been drawn.

91
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,430
And I'll show you what I mean.

92
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,160
If we draw-- let's just draw
a little line here.

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
I think now you'll start
to see what I'm doing.

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,960
If we have a line here,
what's this angle?

95
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,170
Well, this whole thing is a
right angle, it's 90 degrees,

96
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,340
so this angle would
be 60, right?

97
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,330
And so would this angle.

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,130
This angle would also
be 60 degrees.

99
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,630
And so would this
angle, right?

100
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,000
Because they have to add up to
180, and if two of them are

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,580
60, the third one's
going to be 60.

102
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,580
So what do we know about this
triangle right here?

103
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, it's an equilateral
triangle.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,520
All the sides are the
same because all the

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,990
angles are the same.

106
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,220
Well, we know one
of the sides.

107
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,470
We know this side we made up
because it's going to be the

108
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,060
same length as this
side up here.

109
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,010
So this is going to be 6.

110
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,480
Well, if that side is 6, then
all of the sides of this

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,400
equilateral triangle are going
to have to be 6, right?

112
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,950
And then we're done.

113
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,610
Now we just have to add
up all the sides.

114
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,340
So it's 6 plus 6 plus 6
plus 6 plus 6, right?

115
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,090
We ignore this one.

116
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,010
This isn't part of the
perimeter, the perimeters are

117
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,170
the purple sides, so it's one,
two, three, four, five, sixes,

118
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,180
so 5 times 6 equal to 30.

119
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,430
Choice D.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,480
   

121
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:15,930
All right, problem number 15.

122
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:28,420
m is the greatest prime
factor of 38.

123
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:40,690
n is the greatest prime
factor of 100.

124
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,780
What is the value of m plus n?

125
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,220
Well, without knowing a trick
here-- a trick hasn't just

126
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,440
jumped into my head-- let's just
try to factor them, do

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,690
the prime factorization.

128
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,100
   

129
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,350
And actually the easiest way to
do the prime factorization

130
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,930
is, well-- look, we want to get
the greatest prime factor,

131
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,020
and this one is actually
pretty easy.

132
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,430
Because you have two, and
then it's 2 times what?

133
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,670
2 times 19.

134
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,240
We're done.

135
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,350
That was pretty easy, right?

136
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,140
2 times 19, 19 is the greatest
prime factor of 38.

137
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,130
100 might take us a little
bit more time, right?

138
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,740
Because it's 2 times 50.

139
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,070
100 is 2 times 50.

140
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,120
50 is 2 times 25.

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,920
25 is 5 times 5.

142
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,290
Actually, that didn't take
us much time, either.

143
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,520
This is just a straight-- I
thought there might be a trick

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,860
here-- but this is just
a straight prime

145
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,910
factorization problem.

146
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,620
So the greatest prime
factor of 100 is 5.

147
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:48,420
You add them together, 19
plus 5 is equal to 24.

148
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,090
And that is choice C.

149
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,490
OK, let's see if I have time to
fit in problem number 16.

150
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,030
Otherwise I'll do it
in the next video.

151
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,030
   

152
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,820
Line L has a positive slope
and passes-- let me draw

153
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,220
coordinate axes.

154
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,870
So that's my y-axis, that's my
x-axis, and I'm going to drawn

155
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,995
another line in a
different color.

156
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's see, has a positive
slope-- so that means it's

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,850
going to go from the bottom
left to the top right.

158
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,790
And it goes through
the point 0, 0.

159
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,400
So this is line l.

160
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,380
Line l looks something
like that.

161
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,630
So this is line l.

162
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,820
   

163
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,520
If line k is perpendicular to
line l, which of the following

164
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,190
must be true?

165
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,409
So it intersects at a
perpendicular angle.

166
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,429
So line k is going to look
something-- let me do it in a

167
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,159
different color-- line k is
going to look something like

168
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,710
this, right?

169
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,960
It's perpendicular.

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:53,570
   

171
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,400
I have a feeling that this is
going to go into something

172
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,390
that you just need to know.

173
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,110
The perpendicular-- if you know
the slope of something,

174
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,950
let's say line l's slope.

175
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:09,490
Let's say l is y is equal to mx
plus b, but we know it goes

176
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,240
through the intercept, so
it's actually just mx.

177
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,210
Then we know that line k, right
here, is going to have

178
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,760
the negative inverse of
the slope of line l.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,880
So it's going to be negative
1 over mx and then plus b.

180
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,030
This could intersect right here,
we don't know because

181
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,380
they didn't tell us it goes
through the origin.

182
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,830
So we don't know what
b is. b could be 0.

183
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,590
But the bottom line is, the only
thing we do know is that

184
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,470
if this number is positive,
this number

185
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,430
is going to be negative.

186
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,880
And they told us that this
is positive, right?

187
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,860
And let's see, choice a, line
k passes through 0, 0.

188
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,330
No, no.

189
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,850
Oh, it's C, choise C.

190
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,440
Line k has a negative slope.

191
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,070
And that's all we know.

192
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,850
See you in the next video.
