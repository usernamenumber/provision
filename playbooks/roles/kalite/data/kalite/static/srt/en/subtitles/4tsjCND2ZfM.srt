1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:03,090
So, say your vector field green bean cassarole is in the oven

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,449
and it's time to think about a nice crispy onion topping.

3
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:08,427
Normal people might use French's French fried onions in a can,

4
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:09,855
but super awesome people use

5
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:14,131
a real French person and real fresh onions to make their own fresh onion toroids.

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,508
And they fry three linked with the Borromean property

7
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:18,770
to get Borromean onion rings.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,516
The Borromean rings show up in many forms.

9
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,735
They come flat and in 3D, round, rectangle-y, triangle-y

10
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,986
but the important thing is not the way the rings appear

11
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:28,508
but the way they are connected to each other.

12
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:30,275
The thing about the borromean rings is that

13
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:32,867
no two of the rings are actually linked together.

14
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,904
Ignore the pink and just look at the green and brown.

15
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,374
They're sitting on top of each other--not linked.

16
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:41,160
And if you just look at the green and pink, or pink and brown,

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,466
it's the same thing.

18
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,164
And yet, all three together are linked inseparably.

19
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:47,300
So to make your borromean rings out of onion rings

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,197
you will have to cut one of your rings

21
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,341
and then fasten it back with a toothpick or something

22
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,469
which can be removed after frying.

23
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,591
Or you can use the fourth dimension.

24
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,399
And luckily, I have a four dimensional guest to help me out.

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,103
If you're stuck in three dimensions

26
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:01,577
you can think of it like this--

27
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,772
Here I have an outside ring and an inside ring.

28
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,183
Now the third ring, which I have cut is going to go

29
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:10,321
outside of the outside ring, but inside of the inside ring.

30
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,900
Each ring is wholely out of and wholey inside of

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,237
the other two rings

32
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:16,403
so that no two are linked but all three are.

33
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,740
You can also think of laying two on each other flat,

34
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,486
one on top of the other and having the third

35
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:22,230
weave through them, so that it goes over

36
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,902
the one on top and under the one on bottom

37
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:27,482
The result can be made to be flatter or more spherical.

38
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,834
In some, you can see the relationship that Borromean rings

39
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,321
have with braids.

40
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,175
Sure the orange, yellow and red ribbons are all twisted together,

41
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:36,338
but no two strands are twisted together.

42
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,778
If I pull out the orange one,

43
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,571
the other two fall apart.

44
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,262
Some people in cultures and stuff think of this

45
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:43,846
togetherness property as a metaphor for unity.

46
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,641
So when you eat Borromean onion rings

47
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,686
you get to feel all deep and symbolic.

48
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,604
But don't forget to save enough to put on top

49
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,356
of your green bean matharole.

50
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:52,557
And there we go.

51
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,906
At this point, I've got a gelatinous cranberry cylinder,

52
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,562
bread spheres with butter prism,

53
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:59,369
mathed potatoes, a vector field green bean matharole,

54
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:03,490
with Borromean onion rings, apple pi and pumpkin tau.

55
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,620
All I need is a double helix cut ham.

56
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,747
And of course the crowning glory of the feast,

57
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:11,747
which I will tell you about next time.
