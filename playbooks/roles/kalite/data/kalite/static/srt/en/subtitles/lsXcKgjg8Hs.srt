1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
Let's do another states of
matter phase change problem.

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,280
And we'll deal with
water again.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,340
But this one hopefully will
stretch our neurons a little

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,360
bit further.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,205
So let's say I have 500
grams of water.

7
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:14,990
   

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,710
Of liquid water.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,420
At 60 degrees Celsius.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,170
Now my goal is to get it to
zero degrees Celsius.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,670
And the way I'm going to do it
is, I'm going to put ice into

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,480
this 500 grams of water.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,070
And my ice machine at home makes
ice that comes out of

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:44,480
the machine at minus 10
degrees Celsius ice.

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,710
And my question is, exactly
how much ice do I need?

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,690
So how much, or how
many grams of ice?

17
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,820
   

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,140
And I'm going to take the ice
out of the freezer and just

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,490
plop it into my liquid.

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,890
How much do I need to bring this
liquid, this 500 grams of

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,870
liquid water, down
to zero degrees?

22
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,970
So the idea, if we just
imagine a cup here.

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,800
Let me draw a cup.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,270
This is a cup.

25
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,130
I have some 60 degree
water in there.

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,580
I'm going to plunk a big
chunk of ice in there.

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,460
   

28
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,350
And what's going to happen is
that heat from the water is

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,250
going to go into the ice.

30
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,140
So the ice is going to absorb
heat from the water.

31
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,890
So in order for water to go
from 60 degrees to zero

32
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,040
degrees, I have to extract
heat out of it.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,260
And we're about to figure
out just how much heat.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,620
And so we have to say, whatever
was extracted out of

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,760
the water, essentially has to
be contained by the ice.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,320
And the ice can't get
above zero degrees.

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,150
Essentially, that amount of
ice has to absorb all that

38
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,180
heat to go from minus
10 to zero.

39
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,780
And then also, that energy will
be used to melt it a bit.

40
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,230
But if we don't have enough ice,
then the ice is going to

41
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,310
go beyond that and then
warm up even more.

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,009
So let's see how we do this.

43
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,380
So how much energy do we have
to take out of the 500 grams

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,680
of liquid water?

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,570
Well, it's the same amount of
energy that it would take to

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,540
put into zero degrees
liquid water and

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,150
get it to 60 degrees.

48
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,180
So we're talking about
a 50 degree change.

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,150
So the energy or the heat out
of the water is going to be

50
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:46,060
the specific heat of water,
4.178 joules per grams Kelvin.

51
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,330
And I have to multiply that
times the number of grams of

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,090
water I have to cool down, I
have to take the heat out of.

53
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,330
And we know that's 500 grams.
And then I multiply that times

54
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,680
the temperature differential
that we care about.

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,260
And just a side note, I use
this specific heat because

56
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,560
we're dealing with
liquid water.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,680
   

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,540
Liquid water going
from 60 to zero.

59
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,590
So the final thing, I have to
multiply it by the change in

60
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,050
temperature.

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,350
The change in temperature
is 60 degrees.

62
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,450
Times 60 degrees.

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,410
There's a little button on the
side of my pen, when I press

64
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,900
it by accident sometimes it
does that weird thing.

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,110
So let's see what this is.

66
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:37,780
So this is 4.178 times 500 times
change of 60 degrees.

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,040
It could be a change of 60
degrees Kelvin or a change of

68
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,960
60 degrees Celsius.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,600
It doesn't matter.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,100
The actual difference is the
same, whether we're doing

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,840
Kelvin or Celsius.

72
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:57,130
And it's 125,340 joules.

73
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,340
So this is the amount of heat
that you have to take out of

74
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,450
60 degree water in order to get
it down to zero degrees.

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,110
Or the amount of heat you have
to add to zero degree water to

76
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,920
get it to 60 degrees.

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,300
So essentially, our ice has
to absorb this much energy

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,779
without going above
zero degrees.

79
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,060
So how much energy can
the ice absorb?

80
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,149
Well let's set a variable.

81
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,940
The question is how much ice.

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,350
So let's set our variable,
maybe we'll call it I.

83
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,370
Let's do x. x is always
the unknown variable.

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:37,030
So we're going to have
x grams of ice.

85
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,960
OK, and it starts at
minus 10 degrees.

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,530
So when this x grams of ice
warms from minus 10 degrees to

87
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,405
zero degrees Celsius, how much
energy will it be absorbing?

88
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:52,040
   

89
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,140
So to go from minus 10 degrees
Celsius to zero degrees

90
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,450
Celsius, the heat that's
absorbed by the ice is equal

91
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:11,420
to-- is equal to the specific
heat of ice, ice water, 2.05

92
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:19,690
joules per gram Kelvin, times
the amount of ice.

93
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,830
That's what we're solving for.

94
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,050
So times x.

95
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,150
Times the change
in temperature.

96
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,230
So this is a 10 degree change
in Celsius degrees, which is

97
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,090
also a 10 degree change
in Kelvin degrees.

98
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,730
We can just do 10 degrees.

99
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,850
I could write Kelvin here, just
because at least when I

100
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,670
wrote the specific heat units,
I have a Kelvin in the

101
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:38,840
denominator.

102
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,760
It could have been a Celsius,
but just to

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
make them cancel out.

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,880
This is, of course, x grams.
So the grams cancel out.

105
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,440
So that heat absorbed to go from
minus 10 degree ice to

106
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,220
zero degree ice is 2.05
times 10 is 20.5.

107
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:03,890
So it's 20.5 times x joules.

108
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,550
This is to go from minus 10
degrees to zero degrees.

109
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,780
Now, once we're at zero degrees,
the ice can even

110
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,120
absorb more energy before
increasing in

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,980
temperature as it melts.

112
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,950
Remember, when I drew that
phase change diagram.

113
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,250
The ice gains some energy
and then it

114
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,260
levels out as it melts.

115
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,720
As the the bonds, the hydrogen
bonds start sliding past each

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
other, and the crystalline
structure breaks down.

117
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,540
So this is the amount
of energy the

118
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,790
ice can also absorb.

119
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,815
   

120
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,880
Let me do it in a
different color.

121
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,430
Zero degree ice to zero--
I did it again--

122
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,983
to zero degree water.

123
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,960
   

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
Well the heat absorbed now
is going to be the heat

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,300
of fusion of ice.

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,510
Or the melting heat,
either one.

127
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,730
That's 333 joules per gram.

128
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,760
It's equal to 333.55 joules per
gram times the number of

129
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,090
grams we have. Once
again, that's x

130
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,770
grams. They cancel out.

131
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:18,580
So the ice will absorb 333.55
joules as it goes from zero

132
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,510
degree ice to zero
degree water.

133
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,453
Or 333.55x joules.

134
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,690
Let me put the x there,
that's key.

135
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,970
So the total amount of heat
that the ice can absorb

136
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,660
without going above
zero degrees.

137
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,100
Because once it's at zero degree
water, as you put more

138
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,800
heat into it, it's going to
start getting warmer again.

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,080
If the ice gets above zero
degrees, there's no way it's

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,020
going to bring the water
down to zero degrees.

141
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,040
   

142
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,340
The water can't get above
zero degrees.

143
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,280
So how much total heat
can our ice absorb?

144
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,440
So heat absorbed is equal to the
heat it can absorb when it

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,400
goes from minus 10 to
zero degrees ice.

146
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,950
And that's 20.5x.

147
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,950
Where x is the number of grams
of ice we have. Plus the

148
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,970
amount of heat we can absorb as
we go from zero degree ice

149
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,600
to zero degree water.

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,155
And that's 333.55x.

151
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,500
And of course, all of
this is joules.

152
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,860
So this is the total amount of
heat that the ice can absorb

153
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,270
without going above
zero degrees.

154
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,520
Now, how much real energy
does it have to absorb?

155
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,289
Well it has to absorb all of
this 125,340 joules of energy

156
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,070
out of the water.

157
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,360
Because that's the amount of
energy we have to extract from

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,120
the water to bring it down
to zero degrees.

159
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,820
So the amount of energy
the ice absorbs

160
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,690
has to be this 125,340.

161
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:53,200
So that has to be equal
to 125,340 joules.

162
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,380
We can do a little bit
of algebra here.

163
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,640
Add these two things.

164
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:10,670
20.5x plus 333.55x is 354.05x.

165
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,470
Is that right?

166
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,370
Yeah, 330 plus 30 is 350.

167
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,310
Then you have a 3 with
a 0.5 there.

168
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,960
354.05x and that is equal to the
amount of energy we take

169
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,500
out of the water.

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,750
You divide both sides.

171
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:31,590
So x is equal to 125,340
divided by 354.05.

172
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,210
I'll take out the calculator
for this.

173
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,210
   

174
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:43,010
The calculator tells me 125,340,
the amount of energy

175
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:53,770
that has to be absorbed by the
ice, divided by 354.05 is

176
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,960
equal to 354 grams. Roughly;
there's a little bit extra.

177
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,700
So actually, just to be careful
maybe I'll take 355

178
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,360
grams of ice.

179
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,020
Because I definitely want
my water to be chilled.

180
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:12,980
So our answer is x is equal
to 354.02 grams of ice.

181
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,900
So this is interesting.

182
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,860
I had 500 grams of liquid.

183
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,120
And you know, intuitively I
said, well if I have to bring

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,660
that down to zero degrees, I'd
have to have a ton of ice.

185
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,220
But it turns out, I only need,
what was the exact number?

186
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,960
So the liquid is 500 grams.
About, roughly half a pound,

187
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,930
if you want to get a sense for
how much 500 grams is.

188
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,920
A kilogram is 2.2 pounds.

189
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,080
So this ice is 354.

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,010
So you actually have to have
less ice than water.

191
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,220
Which is interesting, because
it seems like the ice isn't

192
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,760
making that big of a
temperature change.

193
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,650
The ice is only going from
minus 10 to zero degrees.

194
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,870
While the water is going all
the way from 60 degrees to

195
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,570
zero degrees.

196
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,130
So you're like, how does
that work out?

197
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,340
And the reason is because so
much energy can be absorbed by

198
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,410
the ice in the form of potential
energy as it melts.

199
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,740
So if you talk about all the
energy that the ice is

200
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,910
asborbing, most of it is
due to the heat of

201
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,920
fusion right there.

202
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,630
You can actually have zero
degree ice and it can still

203
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,020
absorb this huge amount of
energy just by melting it.

204
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,140
Without even changing
its temperature.

205
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,700
Anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.
