1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:06,267
so we're in the home stretch, let's see if part C is true. We're running out of real estate, so let me

2
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:13,800
copy and paste it. Actually maybe i can do it over here to the left, i have some doodles here, let me

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,600
clear those out. let's see if we can do it here to the left

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,533
Part C. So we have this determinate, and it's claiming it equals 0

5
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:28,467
Let's see if that's true, so we can actually try to multiply these out and see if anything interesting happens

6
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:35,905
but we could even better leverage some of the albegra we;ve already done for Part A

7
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:46,467
In part A, we figured out... we figured out that z minus z1 is equal to T times Z two minus Z one

8
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:57,400
So this thing right overe here... this is the same thing as T times Z two minus z one

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,667
The reason why that's interesting is I have z two minus z one

10
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,800
here, so I'm starting to have similar things

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,011
and then this thing over here... so if I take the conjugate of each of these... if I take the conjugate

12
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:13,400
of each of these... if I take the conjugate of z minus the conjugate of z one, this is going to be equal

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,531
to T times the conjugate of Z2 minus the conjugate of Z1, and i know that because when i do this, I'm

14
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:27,333
swapping all the signs on the imaginary parts of the complex numbers. So if you were to go through this

15
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:31,800
entire process, just swapping the imaginary parts of the complex number. The end result

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,133
would have its imaginary parts swapped, and that's exactly what we have over here. We have the imaginary

17
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,867
parts swapped over here.

18
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:45,000
so if you want to work it out, set this equal to A plus B I or set this equal to A one plus B one. you

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,371
can work it out

20
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:51,133
but i think it's a pretty intuitive idea, that we're just making all of the... We're just swapping the

21
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:55,008
signs of all the imaginary parts of these complex numbers.

22
00:01:55,008 --> 00:02:04,641
Now with this said, this determinate becomers pretty simple. This becomes T times z two minus z1. this

23
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:18,321
becomes T times... T times the conjugate of Z2-Z1 this down here is Z2-Z1 and then this over here

24
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:25,400
is the conjugate of Z2-Z1. So what is this determinate, It's going to be this times this, so it's T

25
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:34,559
times Z2 minus Z1 times z2 minus z1, times the conjugate of those, so it;s that times that

26
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:49,993
minus this times this, so minus t Z2-Z1 times the conjugate of Z2 minus the conjugate of Z1. Now this

27
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:55,533
is exactly equal to this, these things are obviously going to cancel out, and we're clearly going to

28
00:02:55,533 --> 00:03:05,067
get 0, so C is also true, so the correct answers to this original problem. The correct answers were

29
00:03:05,067 --> 99:59:59,999
A,C, and D
