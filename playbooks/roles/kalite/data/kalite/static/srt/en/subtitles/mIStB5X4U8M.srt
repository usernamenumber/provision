1
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:02,470
In this video I want to talk a little bit about

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,605
what it means to be a prime number

3
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:09,605
and what you will hopefully see in this video

4
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,606
is this pretty straightforward concept

5
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,940
but as you progress through your mathematical career

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,536
you'll see that there is actually fairly sophisticated concepts

7
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:19,869
that can be built on top of the idea of the prime number

8
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,106
and that includes the idea of cryptography

9
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,271
and maybe some of the encryption that your computer

10
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,023
uses right now could be based on prime numbers.

11
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,107
If you don't know what encryption means

12
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:30,439
you don't have to worry about it right now

13
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:32,071
you just need to know that prime numbers are

14
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,538
pretty important. So I'll give you the definition

15
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:37,870
and the definition might be a little confusing

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,537
but when we see it with examples it should be pretty straightforward

17
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:49,203
A number is prime if it is a natural number

18
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:56,870
for example 1, 2 or 3 (the counting numbers starting at 1)

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,605
or you could also say "the positive integers"

20
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:30,580
it is a natural number divisible by exactly two natural numbers: itself and 1.

21
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:34,060
Those are the two numbers that it's divisible by.

22
00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:41,864
If this does not make sense for you lets just do some examples.

23
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:44,727
Lets figure out if some numbers are prime or not.

24
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,459
So lets start with the smallest natural numbers.

25
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,268
The number 1. So you might say "1 is divisible by 1"

26
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:56,864
and "1 is divisible by itself", hey! 1 is a prime number!

27
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,661
But remember, part of our definition, it needs to be divisible

28
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:06,661
by exactly two natural numbers. 1 is divisible only by one natural number, only by 1.

29
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:15,698
So 1, even it may be a little counter intuitive, is not prime.

30
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:19,615
Lets move on to 2.

31
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:28,102
So 2 is divisible by 1 and by 2, and not by any other natural numbers.

32
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,781
So it seems to fit our constraints.

33
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:32,460
It's divisible by exactly two natural numbers.

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:40,866
Itself and 1. So the number 2 is prime.

35
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:52,126
I will circle the numbers that are prime.

36
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:53,614
The number 2 is interesting because

37
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:56,282
it's the only even number that is prime.

38
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:58,058
If you think about it, any other even number

39
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:03,282
is also going to be divisible by 2., so it won't be prime.

40
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,541
We'll think about that more in future videos.

41
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:10,866
Lets try out 3. Well, 3 is definitely divisible by 1 and 3

42
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:12,866
and it's not divisible by anything in between.

43
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:19,058
it's not divisible by 2. So 3 is also a prime number.

44
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:24,449
Lets try 4.

45
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,282
4 is definitely divisible by 1 and 4, but

46
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:35,394
it's also divisible by 2. So it's divisible

47
00:03:35,394 --> 00:03:38,861
by three natural numbers: 1, 2 and 4.

48
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:42,861
So it does not meet our constraints for being prime.

49
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:47,061
Lets try out 5.

50
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,394
5 is definitely divisible by 1,

51
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:56,273
It's not divisible by 2, 3 or 4

52
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:59,274
(you could divide 5 / 4 but you would get a remainder)

53
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,060
And it is exactly divisible by 5, obviously.

54
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,527
So once again, 5 is divisible by exactly two natural numbers: 1 and 5

55
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:13,061
So once again, 5 is prime. Lets keep going,

56
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,527
so that we see if there is any kind of a pattern here

57
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,527
and then maybe I'll try a really hard one

58
00:04:17,527 --> 00:04:24,394
that tends to trip people up. So lets try the number 6.

59
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:33,274
It is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6.

60
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:36,357
So it has four natural number "factors",

61
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:38,196
I guess you could say it that way

62
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,524
So it does not have exactly two numbers that it's divisible by,

63
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:44,795
it has four, so it is not prime.

64
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:47,662
Lets move on to 7.

65
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:54,440
7 is divisible by 1, not 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6,

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,272
but it's also divisible by 7

67
00:04:56,272 --> 00:05:00,795
so 7 is prime. I think you get the general idea here.

68
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:05,997
How many natural numbers, numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

69
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:08,196
the numbers that you learn when you are two years old

70
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:10,524
not including zero, not including negative numbers,

71
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:12,795
not including fractions and irrational numbers,

72
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,357
and decimals and all the rest,

73
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:17,397
just regular counting positive numbers.

74
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,061
If you have only two of them,

75
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,773
if you are only divisible by yourself and by 1,

76
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,395
then you are prime.

77
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:24,606
and the way I think about it,

78
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:26,528
if we don't think of the special case of 1,

79
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:30,462
prime numbers are kind of these building blocks of numbers.

80
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,129
You can't break them down anymore.

81
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,595
They are almost like the atoms.

82
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:34,994
If you think about what the atom is,

83
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:37,631
or what people thought atoms were when they first...

84
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,688
they thought they were these things

85
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,757
you couldn't divide anymore.

86
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,681
We now know we could divide atoms and actually

87
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,690
if you do you may create a nuclear explosion.

88
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,655
But it's the same idea behind prime numbers. In theory, no prime number is not a theory.

89
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:52,003
You can't break them down

90
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:56,602
into products of smaller natural numbers.

91
00:05:56,602 --> 00:06:00,763
Things like 6 you can say, hey, 6 is 2 times 3,

92
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,001
you can break it down, and notice, we can break it down

93
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,467
as a product of prime numbers.

94
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,801
We've kind of broken it down into it's parts.

95
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,934
7 you can't break it down anymore.

96
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:13,836
All you can say is 7 equals 1 times 7.

97
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:15,838
And in that case you haven't really broken it down much.

98
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:18,004
You just have the 7 there again.

99
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:19,533
6 you can actually break it down.

100
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:23,011
4 you can actually break it down as 2 times 2.

101
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:25,800
Now with that out of the way lets think about

102
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,425
some larger numbers, and think about

103
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:29,579
whether those larger numbers are prime.

104
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:34,286
So lets try 16.

105
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:40,676
So clearly any natural number is divisible by 1 and itself.

106
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:42,000
So 16 is divisible by 1 and 16.

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,512
So you are going to start with two,

108
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:45,387
so if you can find anything else that goes into this

109
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:47,194
then you know you are not prime.

110
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:50,318
And for 16 you could have 2 times 8,

111
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,694
you can have 4 times 4,

112
00:06:52,694 --> 00:06:54,718
so it has a ton of factors here,

113
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,787
above and beyond just the 1 and 16.

114
00:06:56,787 --> 00:07:02,278
So 16 is not prime. What about 17?

115
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:05,611
1 and 17 will definitely go into 17,

116
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:10,052
2 doesn't go into 17, 3 doesn't go, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ...

117
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:14,051
none of those numbers, nothing between 1 and 17

118
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:20,253
goes into 17, so 17 is prime.

119
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:23,052
And now I'll give you a hard one.

120
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:25,527
This one can trick a lot of people.

121
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:33,611
What about 51? Is 51 prime?

122
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:36,120
And if you are interested you can pause the video here

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,918
and try to figure out by yourself

124
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,321
if 51 is a prime number.

125
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:44,653
If you can find anything other than 1 or 51

126
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:47,611
that is divisible into 51. It seems like...

127
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,252
wow this is kind of a strange number

128
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,585
You might be tempted to think it's prime,

129
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,387
but I'm now going to give you the answer.

130
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:59,119
It is not prime, because it is also divisible by 3 and 17

131
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,998
3 times 17 is 51.

132
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,119
So hopefully this gives you a good idea

133
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,653
of what prime numbers are all about,

134
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,786
and hopefully we can give you some practice on that

135
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:13,000
in future videos and maybe in some of our exercises.
