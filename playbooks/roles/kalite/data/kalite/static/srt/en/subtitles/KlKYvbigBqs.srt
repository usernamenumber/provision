1
00:00:01,111 --> 00:00:04,381
Let's draw ourselves a triangle.

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:15,528
Let's say this (blue) side has lenght 6, this (pink) side has lenght 10 and this (green) side has lenght x

3
00:00:15,528 --> 00:00:22,200
And what I'm going to think about is how large or how small x can be

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,895
How large or how small can this (green) side be.

5
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:29,002
The first question is "How small can it get?"

6
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:37,642
Well, if we want to make this small we would just have to look at this (green) angle here and make it smaller

7
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:40,952
So let's try to make this angle as small as possible.

8
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:55,647
So we have our side of lenght 10, and I'm going to make this angle really really small, approaching 0

9
00:00:55,647 --> 00:01:00,096
If that angle becomes 0 we end up with a degenerate triangle

10
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:03,798
Essentially it becomes one-dimensional, we lose our 2-dimensionality

11
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:09,891
But as we approach 0 this side starts to coincide or get closer and closer to the 10 side.

12
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:15,351
And you could imagine the case where it actually coincides with it and you actually get the degenerate

13
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,582
So if we want this point here (on the 10 side) to get as close as possible to that point over there (on the 6 side)

14
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:22,714
-essentially minimizing your distance x-

15
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:27,298
the closest way is that you make the angle all the way equal to 0

16
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:34,691
Let me draw a progression. Now the angle is getting smaller, this (blue) side is lenght 6

17
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:36,937
x is getting smaller

18
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:45,504
so we keep making that angle smaller and smaller all the way until we get a degenerage triangle

19
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:53,314
So you have the (pink) side of lenght 10. Now the angle that we care about is essentially 0

20
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:57,399
This (blue) side is lenght 6

21
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,494
And so what is the distance between this point and this point? That distance is lenght x

22
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:06,633
So in the degenerate case, this (green) length right over here is x

23
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,101
and we know that 6 + x is going to equal 10

24
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:15,311
So in this degenerate case x will equal 4

25
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:21,229
So if you want this to be a real triangle, at x = 4 you've gotten these points as close as possible

26
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,548
It's degenerated into a line segment.

27
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:28,510
If you want this to be a triangle x has to be greater than 4

28
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,886
Now let's think about it the other way.

29
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:33,465
How large can x be?

30
00:02:33,465 --> 00:02:37,659
To think about larger and larger x's we need to make this (green) angle bigger

31
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:40,099
So let's try to do that.

32
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:47,413
Let's draw the 10 side again. This is my 10 side

33
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,496
and we make that angle bigger and bigger.

34
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:54,016
So now let me take the 6 side and put it like that.

35
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:59,162
So now our angle is getting bigger and bigger. It's approaching 180 degrees.

36
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:05,533
At 180 degrees our triangle once again will be turned into a line segment, becoming a degenerate triangle.

37
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:09,384
Let me draw the side of lenght x.

38
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,134
So we are trying to maximize the distance between that point (on the 10 side) and that point (on the 6 side).

39
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,016
This is the side of lenght x

40
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:16,021
Let's go all the way to the degenerate case.

41
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,570
At the degerate case, at 180 degrees,

42
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:24,373
the side of lenght 6 forms a straight line with the side of lenght 10.

43
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:29,596
And this is how you can get this point and that point as far appart as possible.

44
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:33,082
In this situation, what is the distance between that point (on the 6 side) and that point (on the 10 side)?

45
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,767
which is the distance that's going to be our x

46
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:40,848
In this situation x is going to be 6 + 10 = 16

47
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:43,096
If x is 16 we have a degenerate triangle.

48
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:51,557
If we don't want a degenerate triangle, then x is going to have to be less than 16

49
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:58,777
Now the whole principle that we are working on right over here is called the Triangle Inequality Theorem.

50
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,762
It's a pretty basic idea.

51
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:08,621
Any one side of a triangle has to be less than the sum of the other two sides.

52
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:23,161
So the lenght of a side has to be less than the sum of the lenghts of the other two sides.

53
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:26,779
If you're willing to deal with degenerate triangles,

54
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,248
where you essentially form a line segment, lose all your dimensionality and turn to a 1-dimesional figure,

55
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:34,234
then you could say "less than or equal"

56
00:04:34,234 --> 00:04:37,132
but we're just going to stick with non-degerate triangles.

57
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:41,179
So the lenght of a side has to be less than the sum of the lenghts of the other two sides

58
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:45,615
And just using this principle we could have come up with the same exact conclusion

59
00:04:45,615 --> 00:05:03,759
You could say "Well, look: x is one of the sides and it has to be less than 6 + 10 or x has to be less than 16"

60
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,535
The exact same result we got by visualizing it like this

61
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,695
If you want to say how "How small can x be?" you could say:

62
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:26,997
"Well, 10 has to be less than 6 + x, the sum of the lenghts of the other two sides"

63
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:37,415
If you subtract 6 from both sides right over here, you get 4 < x, or x > 4.

64
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:41,425
So this is, in some level, kind of a basic idea.

65
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,049
But it's something that you'll see definitely in geometry

66
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:47,514
and then you'll go far into other types of mathematics and you'll see other versions

67
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,514
of what's essentially this Triangle Inequality Theorem
