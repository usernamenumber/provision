1
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:09,557
So let's start with 3 points: point A, point B, and point C

2
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:10,067
and if we connect these 3 points,

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:14,467
and they are not co-linear, they are not on the same line,

4
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:23,940
if I connect them with line segments, I will get a triangle

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,771
I think you're familiar with the idea of a triangle

6
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:29,652
now what I wanna do in this video is prove

7
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:34,017
that the angles inside a triangle sum up to 180 degrees

8
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:39,427
if the measure of this angle is a, the measure of this angle is b, the measure of this angle is c,

9
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:41,285
and I use lower case a, b, and c

10
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:41,800
actually, let me not use those, as I've already used A, B, and C

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,400
This is x, y and z, I am going to prove that

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,400
x+y+z = 180 degrees

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,867
Now let me clear up some space

14
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,800
What I am going to do is I am going to start off

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
by constructing a line that is parallel to

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,800
line segment BC, but it goes through Point A.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,733
That line might look something like this

18
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:17,733
I can call that line L, & let me continue

19
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:24,600
this line segment BC into a line

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:43,733
They really are parallel lines, so Line L is parallel to BC

21
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,733
and the reason why i do that is then all of a sudden

22
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:51,533
the two other sides of the triangle become transversals

23
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:59,467
Line AB & AC intersect these two paralell lines

24
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:00,533
If you think how could you construct a parallel line

25
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:03,533
all of a sudden, you could always given one line

26
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,467
find a point off that line where a unique parallel line

27
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:15,800
goes through that.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
So what I want to do is to think of line segment

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,200
AB & AC as transversals of those two parallel lines

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:50,000
That is line AB and then i have line AC

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Now let us think about the sum of the angles

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,533
inside the triangle. Let us say the measure of this angle

33
00:02:54,533 --> 00:03:03,133
over here is x, well we know from parallel lines

34
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:10,133
that this is one angle between the transversals

35
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,000
and one of the parallel lines then there is a

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,733
corresponding angle between the same transversal and the

37
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,067
other parallel line . We know that the corresponding angle

38
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:26,400
is equal to x. If this 30 degrees, that is also 30 degrees

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,400
We also know that if that is x, the vertical angle

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,067
is also going to be x. So this is also going to be x

41
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:43,733
Now let us think about another angle in the triangle

42
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:51,133
The measure of this angle over here is y

43
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:56,200
So if this angle is y what is this entire angle

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:13,800
That is going to be x + y. If this entire angle is x+y,

45
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:26,733
then does x=Y have any corresponding angles

46
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:35,400
It has a corresponding angle right over here

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,800
This angle is also x+y.

48
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,667
Now, if this angle is x+y, what is this

49
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:56,867
angle over here. This angle is supplementary to

50
00:04:56,867 --> 00:05:13,133
this magenta angle.So x+y + ? = 180 degrees

51
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:34,133
So, ? angle is 180-x-y .

52
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:45,800
So given how we have set up the three angles, let us add

53
00:05:45,800 --> 00:06:18,000
it up . We have x+y+180-x-y= 180 degrees

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,133
So we proved ourselves that sum of angles of

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of any triangle add upto 180 degrees
