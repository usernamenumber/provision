1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,670
Problem 92. In a certain furniture store,

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:11,150
each week Nancy earns a salary of $240, plus 5% of

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,740
the amount of total sales that exceeds $800 for the week.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,990
Plus 5% of whatever is greater than 800 for the week.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,040
If Nancy earned a total of $450 in a week,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,970
what were her total sales that week?

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,220
So she earns $450,so what was her 5% bonus part?

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,920
So 450 minus 240,she got $210 bonus.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,210
So 210 represents 5% of her sales above 800.

10
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,130
210 is 5% of what number?

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,980
So you could say 210 is equal to 0.05 times x,

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,580
and x will be her sales above 800.

13
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,340
So x is equal to 210 divided by 0.05,

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,610
so 0.05 goes into 210,add some decimal points.

15
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,850
That's the same thing as 5 going into,

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,580
put the decimal point there,21,000.

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,810
So 5 goes into 21 4 times,4 times 5 is 20,bring down 1.

18
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,740
5 goes into 10 2 times,2 times 5 is 10. We're done.

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,960
So her sales were 4,200,but that's not her total sales.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,110
Remember,she only gets 5% on her sales above 800.

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,910
So she sold $4,200 more than $800 that week.

22
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,560
So her total sales are going to be 4,200 plus 800,

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:49,030
which is $5,000. And that's choice E. Next question,93.

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,900
They give us two lists.So that's list one,and they give it 3,

25
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:10,920
6,8, and 19,and they give us list two,they say it's x,3,6,8,

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,970
and 19.

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,300
It's actually the same list,except they have an x here.

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,960
If the median of the numbers in list one above is equal to

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
the median of the numbers in list two above,

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,800
what is the value of x? So what's the median of this list?

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,970
Since we have an even number of numbers,

32
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,060
this would be the average of the middle two numbers,

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,000
so what's the middle two numbers right here?

34
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,590
The middle two numbers are 6 and 8,the average is 6 plus 8

35
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,790
divided by 2,it's 7. So the median is 7.

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,400
So they're telling us that the median of this list is also

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,190
equal to 7,so where can I put x so that the median

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,280
doesn't change. Well what if x is 7?

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,970
If x is 7,then this list becomes 3,6,7,8,19,

40
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,990
and now the middle number,since we have odd numbers,

41
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,880
is actually the middle number.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,410
We don't have to do any of this averaging business.

43
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,750
So now the median is actually 7,if we place 7 there.

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,250
So x equals 7. Choice B. 94.

45
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,840
In a certain city,60% of the registered voters are Democrat,

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,890
and the rest are Republican.

47
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,810
So 40% of voters.

48
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,770
In a mayoral race,if 75% of the registered voters

49
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,830
who are Democrats,and 20% of the registered voters

50
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,920
who are Republicans are expected to vote for candidate A,

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,840
what percentage of the registered voters are expected to vote

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,650
for candidate A?

53
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,830
In a mayoral race,if 75% of Democrats,so 0.75 Democrats

54
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,310
are voting for candidate A,and 20% of Republicans,

55
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,510
so plus 0.2 times the Republicans,are expected to vote for

56
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,040
candidate A,what percent of the voters are voting for

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
candidate A?

58
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,050
So let's just express this in terms of the total voters.

59
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,320
The Democrats are 60% of the voters,Republicans are 40% of,

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,970
not the Republicans,of the voters.

61
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,850
So 0.75 times the Democrats,the Democrats are 60%

62
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,870
of the voters,so let's just substitute.

63
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,350
0.6 voters for D,so we get 0.75 times 0.6 of all the voters,

64
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,740
that's the number of Democrats there are,plus 0.2 times

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,570
the Republicans,Republicans are 0.4 times all the voters.

66
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,930
And so let's see,what's 75 times 6?

67
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,040
Let me just do the whole decimals,0.75 times 0.6.

68
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:56,850
6 times 5 is 30. 6 times 7 is 42 plus 3 is 45.

69
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,500
And we have one,two,three numbers behind the decimal point,

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,310
so it's 0.45 of the voters plus,let's see,2 times 4 is 8,

71
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,490
and we have two numbers behind the decimal,

72
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,730
so it's plus 0.08 times the voters.

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,730
0.45 plus 0.08 that's 0.53.

74
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,210
You have 45 plus 8,is 0.53,or 53% of the voters are going to

75
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,980
vote for candidate A,that's choice B. Problem 95.

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,770
A certain company retirement plan has a rule of 70 provision

77
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,230
that allows an employee to retire when the employee's age

78
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:51,350
plus years of employment within the company total at least 70

79
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,740
So greater than or equal to 70.

80
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,280
In what year could a female employee hired in 1986,

81
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,660
this is interesting,1986,on her 32nd birthday,

82
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,350
first be eligible to retire under this provision?

83
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,680
So let's say that y is equal to the year.

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:31,620
Her age is going to be the year minus 1986 plus 32.

85
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:39,140
That's her age,because she starts at 32,so if the year's 1986

86
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,660
we're just going to get her age as 32.

87
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,280
If the year's 1987,we're going to get 1987 minus 1986,

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,230
which is 1 year,plus 32,her age will be 33.So that's her age.

89
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,960
Her years of employment are going to be the years minus 1986.

90
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,570
So a plus e is going to be equal of this,

91
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,830
and so that is equal to what?

92
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:20,670
2y minus 2 times 1986 plus 32 have to be greater than

93
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,310
or equal to 70.Just so I don't have to multiply 2 times 1986,

94
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,900
let's divide both sides of this equation by 2,and I don't

95
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,570
have to change the inequality,because that's positive.

96
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:40,040
So I get y minus 1986 plus 32 is greater than or equal to 70.

97
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,880
So y is greater than or equal to 70,let me add 1986 to

98
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:57,270
both sides,plus 1986,minus 32. So what's 1986 minus 32?

99
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:05,780
That's 1954,8 minus 3 is 5,6 minus 2 is 4.

100
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,100
What's 70 plus 1954?

101
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:16,860
Plus 70,is 4,5 plus 7 is 12,1 plus 9 is 10,

102
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:24,090
so 2024 is an acceptable year for her. 2024.

103
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,230
And that is not one of the choices,

104
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,620
so I clearly made a mistake.

105
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,570
Let me see where I might have made a mistake.

106
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,850
So a certain employee retirement has a rule of 70 provision

107
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,530
that allows an employee to retire when the employee's age,

108
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,010
age plus years of employment within the company

109
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,480
total at least 70.

110
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,900
In what year could a female employee,the fact that

111
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,920
she's female shouldn't matter,a female employee hired in 1986

112
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,290
on her 32nd birthday,first be eligible to retire

113
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,800
under this provision? OK,her age is going to be the year,

114
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,610
whatever year we're talking about,minus 1986 plus 32.

115
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,790
And then her years of employment are going to be

116
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,170
whatever year we're talking about minus 1986,fair enough.

117
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,520
So I have a year plus year,and I have two subtractions of

118
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,300
my 1986 plus 32 is greater than or equal to 70.

119
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,870
I divide both sides by 30-- oh,I see my mistake.

120
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,520
Here,this stuff right here,where I divided both sides by 2,

121
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,310
I divided only the left side by 2.

122
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,440
That by 2,that by 2-- oh,I didn't even do that.

123
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,310
2 times 1986 divided by 2 is 1986,32 divided by 2 is 16,

124
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,860
70 divided by 2 is 35. OK,so let me rewrite it here.

125
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,480
That's what happens when you try to do too much at once.

126
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:09,410
So I have y is greater than or equal to 35 plus 1986 minus 16

127
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,450
I just added 1986 to both sides,subtracted 16 from both sides

128
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:23,230
So this is equal to 1970,and then we have 35 plus 1970,

129
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,780
so y has to be greater than or equal to 2005,

130
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,700
which is choice C.

131
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,700
And I'm out of time,sorry for that careless error,

132
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,390
and I'll see you in the next video.
