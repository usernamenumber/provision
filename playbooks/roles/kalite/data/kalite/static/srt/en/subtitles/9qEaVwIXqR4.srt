[LEBRON JAMES] What muscles do I use when I take a free throw?

2
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:08,761
[SAL KHAN] Excellent question, LeBron.

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,344
So you can imagine whenever you're doing anything –

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,927
whenever you stand, or even run – you're using a ton of muscles

5
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:16,217
just to to keep your balance – Just to keep your body rigid.

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,744
But what we're going to focus on are

7
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:19,271
the muscles that are directly acting on the ball

8
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:20,799
to make the ball go in that direction –

9
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:24,746
to make it accelerate upwards and towards the basket –

10
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:28,417
which you would hopefully do

11
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,493
when you are taking a free throw.

12
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:36,250
So, the muscles that are doing that are

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,243
the ones that help your fingers go in that direction,

14
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:42,236
help the palm of you hand going in that direction,

15
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:45,230
and help your entire forearm to go in that direction.

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,672
Obviously, at the same time, there are many other muscles at work,

17
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,300
even the muscles that keep your entire arm

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,928
above your head like this –

19
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,557
the muscles that keep you standing.

20
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:55,638
But we're going to just focus on these muscles right over here.

21
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,286
So first, the muscles that allow your fingers to go

22
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:02,934
in the direction that you want the ball to go, and your palm.

23
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:06,584
And you might be surprised to find that

24
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,287
those muscles actually sit in the forearm.

25
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,990
most of those muscles actually do not sit in the hand.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,695
Those muscles are actually here.

27
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:16,369
So the muscles in the front of your forearm right here,

28
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:19,485
they are actually all about flexing the fingers

29
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:22,601
and the hands in that direction.

30
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,208
There are a bunch of names for them.

31
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,815
And I encourage folks to look them up.

32
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,902
But it is a really interesting thing, because we are often used to

33
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,989
muscles being directly where the motion is.

34
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:34,078
But in this case, these muscles, when they're in action, they contract

35
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,678
And muscles, when they're in action do contract.

36
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:41,278
So they're going to contract and they are going to pull essentially on tendons.

37
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:44,880
They're going to pull the whole hand to that way.

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,616
You could view as a kind of pulley

39
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:52,100
So if this was... If you view your wrist joint as kind of pulley.

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:02:03,706
And if you had a rope that is attached to another block. And that block you can view as your hand and your finger

41
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:10,899
So that block is your hand. These muscles right over here, they contract this way

42
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,210
so its ..... pulling on this rope. And were to pull on this rope, what would happen to this block up here?

43
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,187
Well, this block up here is going to go in that general direction.

44
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:23,098
So that what's keep your hand and your fingers going in that way

45
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:25,422
But what about the entire forearm?

46
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:31,298
So once again. The muscles that get your entire forearm going in that direction aren't in your forearm.

47
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:34,018
They are in the back of your upper arm.

48
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,365
So they are right over here. Often referred to as the triceps.

49
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:42,205
The official name are the triceps brachii, but they're right over here

50
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:46,970
and it's called triceps because kind of three-headed muscle. There are three muscle bundles that are going on

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,249
And when these muscles over here, your triceps, when tey contract

52
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:59,868
they allow your entire forearm to essentially streighten out on your elbow so it will go in that direction

53
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,382
In this case, when this muscle, the triceps, contract

54
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,196
your entire forearm is going to .... on your elbow

55
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:10,196
And go like that, which will allow the basket to go in the intended direction
