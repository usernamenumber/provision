1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,636
So I saw these Fruit by the Foots...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,017
...or Fruit by the Feet?

3
00:00:04,017 --> 00:00:05,639
Maybe Fruits by the Foots?

4
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,641
Anyway I figured they had mathematical potential

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,977
so I decided to record myself playing with them.

6
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,579
The first thing that comes to mind when there's a strip of paper,

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,715
even paper covered in fruit-flavored sugar

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,583
is to make a Mobius strip, so I did.

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,586
The thing about Mobius strips is they have one side

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,593
while Fruits by the Foot are by nature two-sided.

11
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:25,726
A normal loop would have a paper side and a sugar side,

12
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:30,194
putting a half twist in would make a sudden transition from one to the other.

13
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,624
But you can also do this.

14
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:34,434
Wrap it around twice so that the sugary part sticks to itself

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,548
and the entire outside is covered in paper.

16
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:38,105
Here's our Mobius strip.

17
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,796
After confirming that Sharpie flip-chart markers

18
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:41,896
won't bleed through the paper,

19
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:45,212
I drew a line along the single side of the Mobius strip

20
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,926
but that's not telling us anything that we didn't already know.

21
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,551
Just like one line can cover both sides,

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,086
except really one side,

23
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,482
the paper does too.

24
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:55,771
So unlike a normal loop of Fruit by the Foot, covered in paper

25
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:57,858
which would need two pieces, one for each side,

26
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:02,169
the Mobius strip can be unwrapped by pulling off a single strip of paper.

27
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:04,097
I went and washed the Sharpie off my hands

28
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,241
and then came back to see what else I could do.

29
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,436
The strip of fruit-flavored gunk has these two lines going down it

30
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,505
perforations dividing it into thirds.

31
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:15,446
One of the go-to Mobius strip fun things is to cut it in half down the middle

32
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:19,420
but after that, cutting it into thirds is the next thing to do.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,610
And it's as if Fruit by the Foot is designed for this purpose

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,535
so I started separating it along this line.

35
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,919
You might want to pause here and think about

36
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,794
what you think would happen...

37
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,379
So I continue around and when I loop around once

38
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,581
now I'm on the other side.

39
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,687
and it turns out to not have been two lines, but one line

40
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,166
that goes around twice.

41
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,853
Let's see what we've got.

42
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,732
It's completely whoa!

43
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,841
I mean, this is totally magical to me,

44
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,575
that there's these two loops and they're linked together

45
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:51,612
and they're not even the same size

46
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,814
and they're like made of flavored sugar gunk.

47
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,949
But let's understand what's going on.

48
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,628
You can do it with paper too.

49
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:59,853
I cut out a strip, twist, and tape.

50
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,456
Now I'm coloring the edge both to demonstrate

51
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,191
that the Mobius strip only has one edge

52
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,582
and so that we can keep track of it.

53
00:02:06,582 --> 00:02:08,762
Because when we cut a strip into thirds,

54
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,497
you could also think of it like this:

55
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,377
you're cutting the edge off.

56
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:14,434
This leaves a thinner Mobius strip,

57
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,279
and a long looping edge.

58
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:18,414
Because of the twist, the edge loops around the body of the Mobius strip,

59
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,411
so the two are linked.

60
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,376
Really though, you should just try it yourself.

61
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:25,445
After making the Mobius strip, and ripping it into thirds,

62
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,722
I poked at the leftover bit of Fruit by the Foot, waiting to be inspired.

63
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,852
I don't know, it's spirally?

64
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,021
I opened up another package so I'd have more to play with

65
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,256
Bam! Whoa! It's got this pattern on it!

66
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,494
I mean, I don't remember this at all about Fruit by the Foot

67
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,524
but then again it's not like I've had one in the past like fifteen years.

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,799
And last time I had a Fruit by the Foot,

69
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,702
I wouldn't have recognized that this is a frieze pattern.

70
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,304
A symmetric pattern that repeats in one dimension.

71
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,407
I mean, repeating patterns are good because

72
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:58,641
they have a rolling stamp that just kind of presses this pattern into it.

73
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,747
But it's got other symmetry too.

74
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,316
The two halves of this pattern are exactly the same,

75
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,753
but not the same as in mirror symmetry going the long way

76
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,489
but it does have mirror symmetry going the short way

77
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,426
plus this point of 180 degree rotational symmetry

78
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:15,407
which basically means, if you turn this strip of Fruit

79
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,559
Roll up around, the pattern is the same.

80
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:21,614
But it's neat that it does this in two tesselating halves

81
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:24,689
so you can flip it around and fold it in half and everything

82
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,507
Ok, so I open the last of my Fruits by the Foot

83
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,107
hoping for another frieze pattern, but it's the same as the last one.

84
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,646
So I make a normal non-Mobius loop

85
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,192
and then I make a couple more and decide

86
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:37,225
to put them together in a Borromean configuration.

87
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,820
The Borromean rings are this arrangement of three loops

88
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,019
that you seem sometimes

89
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,348
and they're linked in such a way that

90
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,858
no two loops are actually linked with each other.

91
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:48,609
I mean, if you look at just two of the three, they're not linked

92
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,499
If you undid any one loop, the other two would also be separated.

93
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,101
Yet, the three together are stuck.

94
00:03:54,486 --> 00:03:57,337
I tighten the loops up because they form this nice cube

95
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,673
and then I decided to try taking off the paper, but

96
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,180
it was tricky because everything's sticky and linky

97
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,111
so it didn't turn out so well.

98
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,480
So since I'm labeling things, I labeled the Mobius strip part

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,716
and that reminds me that the frieze pattern and

100
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:13,596
Mobius strips are related, at least this particular frieze pattern has,

101
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,222
as a result of its other symmetries,

102
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,390
glide reflection symmetry.

103
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,493
And glide reflection symmetry means that a pattern

104
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,228
can be Mobius stripped.

105
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,129
See, when I loop it around into a Mobius strip,

106
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,701
the pattern exactly matches up, even though it's upside down

107
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,636
Oh glide reflections.

108
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,672
The glide is the loop part and the reflect is the flip part.

109
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:37,368
And what that means is that with just one half of this nice tessellating pattern

110
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:38,578
we can loop it with a twist

111
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,129
and it matches up perfectly with itself

112
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,416
to make a complete strip.

113
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,152
At least, theoretically.

114
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,512
In practice it's a rather sticky process.
