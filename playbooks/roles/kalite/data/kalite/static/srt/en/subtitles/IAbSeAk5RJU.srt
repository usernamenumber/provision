1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,050
Evan from Norway has asked me
to do another u substitution

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,350
problem, and I like these
because it gets my momentum

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,920
going for doing other things
that maybe take a little

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,810
bit more preparation.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,050
And the problem he sent me--
and I hope I pronounced his

7
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:21,250
name right-- was the indefinite
integral of sin of x over

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,850
the cosine of x squared dx.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,270
This it also be written as-- he
wrote it in email, so I don't

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,600
know how he exactly saw it, but
it can also be written as sin

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,130
of x over cosine squared of x.

12
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,710
Sometimes it's
written like that.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,270
Either way, I like looking
at this a bit better.

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,350
It's a little bit
less ambiguous.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,740
But in general you know to do u
substitution, or integration by

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,930
substitution when you see
something and you see its

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,580
derivative sitting there.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:49,820
Right.

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,190
You're like wow, this cosine of
x was just an x, or if it was

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,920
just a u, this would be a
really easy integral to do.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,010
We know how to do
this integral.

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,450
Let me do it on the side.

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,680
This integral would be easy.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,850
1 over x squared dx.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,690
We know how to do that.

26
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,210
That would just be the
antiderivative of x squared.

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,580
This is the same thing as the
antiderivative of x to the

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,500
minus 2 dx, and we know how to
take the antiderivative

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
of something like that.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,810
You increase the exponent by
1 and then you multiply by

31
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,730
what your new exponent is.

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,510
So it would be minus
x-- I'm sorry.

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,510
You increase your exponent by
1, and then you divide by

34
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,040
whatever your new exponent is.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,160
So you would,
[? let me do the, ?]

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,450
increasing the exponent x to
the minus 2, you'd increase

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,420
the exponent, you'd
get x to the minus 1.

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,100
And then when you divide this
by minus 1 you get this minus

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
out front, and then of course
you'd have the plus c.

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,070
If you don't believe it
take the derivative.

41
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,190
Negative 1 times minus 1.

42
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,340
That's a positive.

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,360
And then you'd decrease
the exponent by 1, you

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,980
get x to the minus 2.

45
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,700
So if we could get it in
a form that looks like

46
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,530
this, we'd be all set.

47
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,250
And you kind of do
see a pattern.

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,330
Where this x is you have a
cosine there, and then we have

49
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,650
cosines derivative there.

50
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,950
So that's the big clue that we
should be using u substitution.

51
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,815
So let's do that.

52
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,920
And what we're going to do is
we're going to substitute

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,670
u for cosine of x.

54
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:20,170
So if we say u is equal to
cosine of x, and let's take

55
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,750
the derivative of u
with respect to x.

56
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,740
So du/dx is equal to what?

57
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,790
What's the derivative of
cosine of x? it's not

58
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,690
quite sin of x, right?

59
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,302
It's minus sin of x.

60
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:37,820
   

61
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,370
And then we can multiply both
sides by dx, and you get du is

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,720
equal to minus sin of x dx.

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,090
I just multiplied
both sides by dx.

64
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,120
And then up here we
have sin of x dx.

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,380
We don't have minus
sin of x dx.

66
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,710
There we have sin of x dx.

67
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,980
We could have rewritten this
top integral, we could have

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,500
rewritten it like this.

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,930
Sin of x dx.

70
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,680
All of that over
cosine of x squared.

71
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,780
So if we want to substitute for
this, here we have a minus.

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,750
Let's multiply both sides of
this by a negative 1, and you

73
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:25,080
get minus du is equal
to sin of x dx.

74
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,370
And let's see.

75
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,650
So let's rewrite this
original problem.

76
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,690
Now I know I'm running
out of space.

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,000
Let me rewrite it.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,780
So we know that u is equal to
cosine of x, so let's do that.

79
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,720
So now this integral becomes--
and the denominator, instead of

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,170
cosine of x squared,
u is cosine of x.

81
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,930
That's u, right?

82
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,900
We made that definition.

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,240
So that's over u squared.

84
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,260
Cosine of x becomes u.

85
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,240
And then sin of x dx right up
there, what is that equal to?

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,490
Well we just solved
for it here.

87
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,930
That's equal to minus du.

88
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,120
Sin of x dx is
equal to minus du.

89
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,810
So that we can replace
with this, minus du.

90
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,330
And then of course this has
the exact same form as

91
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,200
this thing right here.

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,420
You could rewrite this,
this is equal to let's say

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,940
minus 1 over u squared du.

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,280
I'm just writing it a
bunch of different ways.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,455
Whatever is easier for
you to conceptualize.

96
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:27,550
The same thing as minus
u to the minus 2 du.

97
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,180
And then here we do the same
thing we did up here, although

98
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,870
now we have a minus out front,
that actually makes it

99
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,300
a little bit cleaner.

100
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,530
To take the antiderivative, we
raise u-- it was to the minus 2

101
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,230
power, let's raise it to 1
power higher than that-- so

102
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,960
minus 2 plus 1 is minus 1.

103
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,760
So it's u to the minus 1 power,
and then you want to divide by

104
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,810
minus 1, and I'll do
it explicitly here.

105
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,760
Minus one.

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
And then you had this negative
that was sitting out there

107
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,200
before, so that negative is
still going to be there.

108
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,110
And of course you're
going to have a plus c.

109
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,790
You can view this as a negative
1 or, this negative divided

110
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,870
by a negative, they're
going to cancel out.

111
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,540
And so you're just left with u
to the minus 1 plus c, or 1

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,970
over u plus c is the
antiderivative-- oh sorry,

113
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,950
we're not done yet.

114
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,400
That's just the
antiderivative of this.

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,330
And now we have our
substitution to deal with.

116
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,850
What was our substitution
that we started with?

117
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,780
u is equal to cosine of x.

118
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,700
So if u is equal to cosine of
x, this thing is equal to 1

119
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,830
over cosine of x plus c is
equal to the antiderivative of

120
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:50,200
our original problem, which was
sin of x over cosine

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,450
of x squared dx.

122
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,502
There you go.

123
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,310
See you in the next video.

124
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,610
