00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,703
What i wanna do with this video is to give an overview og how money is created in most market based economies

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:17,581
an even a bit of a discussion of what really is money, and we can go to much more depth in future videos

3
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:24,176
in most market based economies right now there is a central bank, which is essentially the actor,

4
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:27,509
they do many things, they often will be the regulatory agency as well

5
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:33,926
but their main role is to have the right to print money, and to put that money into circulation

6
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:38,170
i'll rely heavily on the model of the US and the Central Bank

7
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:47,370
The central bank in some countries is formally part of the governement

8
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,704
in other countries, its pseudo-independant. In the US its more pseudo independant

9
00:00:51,704 --> 00:01:00,570
Although obviously, closely connected with the government, the UD federal reserve

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,174
a lot of the leaders are appointed by the government, its excess profits go back to the government, so obviously

11
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:11,904
it have very close ties to the goverment. But when the central government decides to print money

12
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:20,174
it literally can just create physical money, or it can create electronic money, which has the same effect

13
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:35,175
So let's say the central bank goes out there, and prints 3 physical dollar bills

14
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:39,258
now it has to figure out, how does it get it into circulation, how does it get it into the economy?

15
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:43,438
It does not just put it into a helicopter and drop it out!

16
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:54,571
Sometimes, in certain circumstances, is can lend this directly to bank, certain types of banks

17
00:01:54,571 --> 00:02:03,037
but the typical way that this enter circulaiton, is that the central bank will use this newly created money

18
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:10,102
to go out into the open market and buy securities and they typically buy safe securities like government debt.

19
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:20,510
So they will go out there and put this into circulation, and in exchange they are buying securities form the open market

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:31,504
So these securities will go to the central bank. so there are securities, or bonds

21
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:40,509
And once they do that, then whoever had these before, whoever was the owner of these securities before

22
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,837
Now they have these dollarbills, and they can either directly spend these dollars

23
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:50,093
or they can deposit these dollarbills in the bank. If they spend the dollars, then whoever they gave those bills to at some point would want a deposit in a bank

24
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:55,904
So someway, by buying these securities, someone now has these dollarbills, and they will deposit them in a private bank.

25
00:02:55,904 --> 00:03:05,260
So let's draw that. So right over here is a private bank. And now it has the dollarbills.

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:15,703
It has the reserves. Now, that's not the end of the story

27
00:03:15,703 --> 00:03:22,103
This money can now be lend and this is key because this is typical in most market economies

28
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,770
where they have fractional reserve lending.

29
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:32,104
franctional reserve lending

30
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:38,037
which is a bit strange, because you are telling the people who just deposited these money here

31
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:41,593
that you can go at any time and you can take this money out.

32
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:46,638
We've got this money for you, you can trust us, you don't have to be paranoid about what's gonne happen with this money

33
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:53,438
But the reality is that this bank i allowed to keep only a fraction of these reserves and lend the rest out.

34
00:03:53,438 --> 00:04:02,036
In order for the system to not be super fragile, the central bank then also insures these banks

35
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:07,038
I just want to show you how this money is created in the fractional reserve lending system

36
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:13,510
So this bank over here says, we'll have to keep a little bit of these reserves in case these guys come the probability of all of my

37
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:20,368
customers come on the same day and ask for all of my money is low. I just have to keep a little bit for whoever does come, and the rest i can lend out

38
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:27,771
Eventhough i promised everyone that all of they money is always available. So they lend it out to whoever needs that money

39
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:34,510
who looks like a decent risk. And those people might not spend it emediately, they would deposit it into a bank

40
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,925
Or they might spend it immediately, they buy a factory or car or something.

41
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:44,674
and whoever they bought those things from will now have this money and they will deposit it into a bank

42
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:49,260
So this newly lend money will now end up in a bank

43
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Also end up in a bank

44
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,437
Now this can it can also only keep a fraction of the reserve and lend out the rest

45
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:10,508
And for simplicity in most banking systems, they only have to keep about 10 percent of the reserves in house and lend out the rest

46
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:15,676
But overhere i'm keeping much larger reserves just for the sake of making it easy to draw this diagram

47
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:20,637
So this bank overhere may decide to keep this dollarbill and could lend this one over here out

48
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:29,438
And once again, when it lends that dollarbill, it will end somehow and the person they lend it to may keep it in a bank temporarily or they might immediately buy

49
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:34,639
something, and when they buy something it will eventually end up in a bank because the person they

50
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,971
bought something from will deposit that money, and so it could end up in another bank.

51
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:45,104
This is interesting and in future videos we will go into more of the math of exactly how much money is being created

52
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:56,260
Its an interesting mathematical problem - actually its the sum of an infinite series and you can look it up if your'e interested.

53
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:05,676
But the basic idea here is that even though the central bank printed 3 units of base dollars, there a lot more money in the system

54
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:11,569
You have this guy who made this deposit thinks he has 3 dollars, this person thinks he has 2 dollars and this person thinks they have on

55
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:19,174
So in this example we have 1,2,3,4,5,6 - 6 dollars

56
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:24,342
So we have 6 dollars in this system

57
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,176
6 dollars

58
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,971
And you might say "is this really money"?

59
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,305
This guy thinks he has it but he's not using it if he had to use it he would have to withdraw it and then the bank would be able to do this

60
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:35,437
And this is where checking accounts is really important

61
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,436
I'm assuming that these are on-demand checking accounts

62
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:44,369
So this guy, the reason why he's not going to withdraw this money is that he can still use it as money by writing checks

63
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:52,771
So this guy says ok this is all the money i have, and he decides that he really needs to buy and apple and that apple costs 1 dollar

64
00:06:52,771 --> 00:07:03,175
He does not have to withdraw this dollar out of the bank, he can write a check

65
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:12,175
So right now he has claims to all 3 of these dollars. He can write a check to the apple vendor, so 1 dollar

66
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:17,926
he writes a check, gives it to the applevendor, and will get the apple so his check is acting as money

67
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:22,592
and now the applevendor will have the rights to one of these apple's overhere

68
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:26,926
and how the applevendor can write a check so this dollar never has to leave the banking system

69
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:32,037
But because of checks it is essentially enabling these transactions to occur, so its still an

70
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:38,371
enabling, it is still acting in some forms of money because the rights to it can change

71
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,675
even though it is sitting out here and has been lend

72
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:45,438
or you can say it is enabling the writing of checks that are acting as some form of money

73
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:53,570
And the whole reason i wanna do this is to show you that the amount of money in circulation

74
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,425
is not essentially in the central banks control

75
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:59,437
They can definitely decise, hey i'm gonna print money, buy securities, put in into circulation

76
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:06,571
or if they wanna take money out of circulation, they can decise to sell these securities

77
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:08,103
and when they sell the securities, them maybe this guy will buy them

78
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,260
and those dollars will go back to the central bank and they will go out of commission

79
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:16,576
But you have this whole effect over here. If you have more lending occuring and the banks are feeling very confident

80
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:22,170
then more of this will happen. You'll get a larger multiplier effect of this lending.

81
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,170
And if less lending is happening, then you could potentially see all of this contract
