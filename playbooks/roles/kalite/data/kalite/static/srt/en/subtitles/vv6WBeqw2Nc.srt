1
00:00:01,884 --> 00:00:03,317
I'm gonna draw for you the heart

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:06,331
And we're actually gonna do a little zooming in now,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:11,320
taking a look at exactly what happens, both in the wall of the heart

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,604
but also going even further in. So, let's start with the heart

5
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,574
heart wall. What were you to see if you were to zoom in? You'd see

6
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:23,174
heart cells. And this is kind of a heart cell with some branches here.

7
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:27,281
And you remember that heart cells, besides just having branches

8
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:31,173
is very distinct looking. Sometimes it has one, but sometimes it has

9
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:34,928
two nuclei. Now let's say we were to zoom in again.

10
00:00:34,928 --> 00:00:38,306
on this heart cell. What would we see if we kind of went further?

11
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:43,146
Well, you know that there are lots and lots and lots of proteins inside these

12
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:46,153
heart cells, and the ones that we've usually been concerning ourselves with

13
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:48,365
are the actin and myosin

14
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:52,274
and these are kind of the classic cell proteins that allow

15
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,988
it to contract. So, it might look a little bit like

16
00:00:55,988 --> 00:01:00,367
this, right, with our actins kind of spaced out a little bit from each other.

17
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,044
I'll label it as I go. This is an actin.

18
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:08,507
And, in the middle of the actin. And in the middle of the actin, you've got myosin.

19
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:11,035
Right? So you've got this purple myosin.

20
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:15,099
And it looks maybe something like this, with the little myosin heads.

21
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:19,487
coming off of it. And you've got some on both sides.

22
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:23,529
And these myosins are going to be tethered to

23
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:28,099
the wall. Right? This wall at the end, and I'll draw that

24
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,950
tethering with green, kind of like that.

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,933
And this is basically, this is titin.

26
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,651
Titin is kind of what keeps the myosin from

27
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:44,375
floating away. And you can think of it as "Well, what happens over time

28
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,732
is that these myosins and actins are gonna start

29
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,613
binding", right? They're gonna start binding, and we call these

30
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:56,044
actin/myosin crossbridges, or you might hear different terms, but basically

31
00:01:56,044 --> 00:01:58,276
the two are interacting with each other.

32
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:02,755
And what the myosin is gonna want to do, is it's gonna want to yank

33
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,934
this way, right? It's gonna want to bind the actin like this.

34
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:09,065
and yank it that way.

35
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:11,757
In fact, all these little myosins are gonna

36
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,344
kind of act the same way, they're gonna wanna yank the

37
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:19,231
actin in the same direction. And in the same way, you've got

38
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:23,154
pulling in the opposite way. You've got pulling towards the middle.

39
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:26,850
basically. So if this were to work, what would happen?

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,654
Well, at the edges, at the end here, we call these guys z disks.

41
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:35,676
Z-discs. You might have heard the term 'z-line', because it looks like

42
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,738
because it looks like a line under a microscope. But if you actually zoom in,

43
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:43,342
and you go up close to it, it's basically a disc of protein. Right?

44
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:47,630
So these z-discs, if our

45
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,542
actins and myosins and indeed interacting and tugging on

46
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:54,309
one another, the way that we think that they should

47
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:59,400
these are going to be pulled inward. It's almost like kind of bringing

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,447
a wall in towards the center. You can kind of think of it that way.

49
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:07,806
You can kind of think of the actin as a rope hanging off the end of this

50
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:10,950
z-disc. And the myosin is literally

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,641
got it's hands on it, yanking on the rope and tugging on the z-disc.

52
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,039
In fact, lots and lots of myosin are doing it all at once.

53
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,974
Kind of in unison. So that's why these discs get moved toward

54
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:27,219
the center. And when they get moved toward the center, we literally call that 'contraction' of the cell.

55
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,556
Or cell contraction. And so these actin ropes

56
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,062
uh, if you want to keep thinking of it in that way,

57
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:37,383
aren't going to be cut or shrunk or anything. They're going to stay the same length.

58
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,833
But these z-discs seem to be brought closer together.

59
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:48,175
the entire thing looks a litte bit more crowded, because the myosin has brought everything to the center.

60
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:49,938
So that's cell contraction.

61
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:55,764
Now, I'm gonna actually take a further zoom-in. Let's say you

62
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,560
actually wanted to zoom in

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,208
to something like this, this white box. Kind of take a look at what that might look like.

64
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:10,999
Let's see that. I'm gonna make a little bit of space. Let's just keep that scene like that.

65
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,644
Let me start my drawing the actin, it's gonna look something like this.

66
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:20,997
And I'm gonna try to keep it somewhat consistent, and we're gonna see what it is that

67
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:26,442
draw along the way. So we've got our actin and we've got our myocin.

68
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:34,000
And our myosin, I'm gonna orient kind of in the same direction as our actin. It's gonna look something like this.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,366
Let's say it's one head there. And let's say we've got our second head there.

70
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:46,871
So we've got our myosin. And of course our myosin is gonna continue in really in both directions, but the majority of the myosin is gonna be that way.

71
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:58,639
So we've got our actin and we've got our myosin, and the story from the previous picture ends there, but we know that we've got our myosin

72
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,724
actin binding sites are gonna be kind abound up

73
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:13,073
by trophomyosin. Trophomyosin is gonna be snaking its through. Looks a little bit like that. And it's basically gonna be sitting in all

74
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:18,945
binding sites that myosin really can't get in there. And in fact, there's also

75
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:24,178
another protein. We talked about the fact that there's another protein called troponin.

76
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:31,727
And troponin is also kind of in the same area I'm actually gonna draw troponin like this.

77
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:40,060
You might be thinking "Why am I drawing troponin in three parts? Why is there a little crescent shaped thing and two little circles?"

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,486
And actually, troponin, even though previously we've talked about troponin as one protien,

79
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:54,314
this whole thing. It's probably more commonly known as 'troponin complex', instead of just the one word 'troponin'.

80
00:05:54,314 --> 00:06:04,365
It's actually a complex of proteins. And there are three to be precise. There's troponin-C over here.

81
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:09,039
I, and T right over here. And if that's not clear, let me put it over on the side here.

82
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:19,242
So there's Troponin-C, troponin-I, and troponin-T. And in yellow we've got our tropomyosin. So now our picture is looking a little bit more accurate, right?

83
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:25,159
Now we've got all of this stuff going on, with the tropomyosin getting in the way of our

84
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:30,359
myosin head. Now, what's gonna make that troponin complex move

85
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:34,985
away? What's gonna kind of clear space for our myosin head? Well, we know

86
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:41,671
that it's gonna be calcium. And I'm gonna draw calcium here, binding to which part of the troponin complex?

87
00:06:41,671 --> 00:06:45,152
Troponin c! C, like calcium.

88
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:49,156
Is what's gonna bind the calcium. So troponin c is gonna bind the calcium.

89
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:54,160
And once it does, once the calcium is down there, it now can scooch

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,267
the tropomyosin out of the way.

91
00:06:57,267 --> 00:07:02,448
So, now the tropomyosin (I'm gonna draw this in green arrows), is basically

92
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:06,772
schooched out of the way, and the myosin head is very happy.

93
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,649
'Cuz it can

94
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:10,488
bind finally to the actin.

95
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:14,627
Now, if there's no calcium. Like you can see in our friend to the right,

96
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:19,987
this troponin is not gonna bind to the calcium.

97
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:23,535
So the tropomyosin is not moved out of the way, it's in the way.

98
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:29,111
And at the end of the day, the myosin is gonna be sad! Because it cannot bind to that actin.

99
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:34,696
So you can see now, from a myosin standpoint, it likes when calcium is around.

100
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:36,703
Because that means it can do work.

101
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:41,395
Now let me clear a little more space for us, and I'm gonna bring up one final point.

102
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:45,861
I mean, if we think that a happy myosin head is a working myosin head, if we take

103
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:51,872
that approach, it's a little bit like I guess getting a job! Right, it makes everyone happy when they get a job.

104
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,729
when they're employed. And myosin heads are no different, they want to be employed.

105
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:00,325
So how do you employ myosin heads? How do you get more jobs for myosin heads?

106
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:04,909
Well, there are basically two strategies for increasing what we call 'inotropine',

107
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:13,373
basically getting more myosin heads working. So two strategies, let's go through them one by one.

108
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:18,742
So the first strategy would be what? Well, you could affect the amount of calcium.

109
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,983
You could get more calcium around. That would be one strategy.

110
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:27,308
And the other strategy might be: you could have the troponin c

111
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:32,532
Remember, the troponin c is part of the complex that's binding the calcium,

112
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:36,651
You could get troponin c to be more sensitive to calcium.

113
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:40,031
And I'm gonna put that in quotes. What do I mean by 'sensitive'?

114
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:44,822
Essentially, you're saying that troponin c could change

115
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:51,154
its shape or its confirmation to bind the calcium that's already around more easily.

116
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:57,003
Basically, you're binding calcium more easily. But I wanted to put the word

117
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,796
'sensitive' because sometimes you'll see that word, and you'll wonder what it means.

118
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:05,203
So bind calcium more easily. So these are the two basic strategies.

119
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:11,788
And you could imagine increasing in one strategy, increasing the calcium, b

120
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:14,932
but leaving the sensitivity of troponin c the same.

121
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:19,472
Really, not changing how easily it will bind calcium.

122
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:24,211
And the overall effect is more myosin heads are working!

123
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,045
So more myosin heads are working.

124
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,930
That would the overall effect.

125
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,235
And you could flip it around. You could say

126
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:38,933
Maybe you have the same amount of calcium, maybe you don't actually increase the calcium,

127
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:46,154
but you do make troponin c bind the calcium that is there more readily.

128
00:09:46,154 --> 00:09:50,659
Or more easily. Well, in that siutation, you also get more myosin heads working.

129
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:55,907
So in either scenario, in either strategy, you're going to get more

130
00:09:55,907 --> 00:10:01,901
myosin heads working. And so these are the two basic strategies for inotropy.
