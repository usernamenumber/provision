99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the area of a square with side (6x - 5y).

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we draw our square, and all the sides are going to have the same length.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they're telling us that the length for each of the sides, which is the same for all of them, is (6x - 5y).

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the height will be (6x - 5y), and so would the width.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if we want to find the area of the square, we're just going to have to multiply the

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
width times the height.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the area of this square is going to be the width, which is (6x - 5y)

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the height.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Times the height, which is also (6x - 5y).

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we just have to multiply these two binomials.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to do this you could either do FOIL if you like memorizing things,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or you could just remember this is just applying the Distributive Property twice.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what we could do is just distribute this entire magenta (6x - 5y)

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times each of, distributing over each of these terms in the yellow (6x - 5y)

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we do that, we will get, this 6x.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This 6x, times this entire (6x - 5y).

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, (6x - 5y), and then we have

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus 5y.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Minus 5y, again, times the entire magenta (6x - 5y)
