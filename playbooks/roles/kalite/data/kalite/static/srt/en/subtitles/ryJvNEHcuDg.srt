1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,850
In the last video, we visualized
an ethane molecule

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,890
with a Newman Projection.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,820
What I want to do in this video
is show that you can

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,120
really visualize longer chains,
or even, we'll see in

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,500
future videos, even cyclical,
ring-based carbon molecules

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,240
with Newman Projections
as well.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,860
And I guess the next most
complex molecule to study

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,220
would be butane.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,520
We could do propane, but butane
will be interesting.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,650
This was ethane right here,
butane will have four carbons.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,070
And if I were to draw it in
kind of a ball and stick

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,800
model, it would look like
something like this.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,560
So this would be one
carbon right there.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,470
Then you would have another
carbon right over there, and

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,930
another carbon right
over there.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,410
And then you'd have your
fourth carbon.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,150
And then your hydrogens.

18
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,210
You would have a hydrogen coming
out like this, like

19
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,420
that, and then up like that.

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,450
This guy would have two
hydrogens that would

21
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,920
stick out like that.

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,670
This guy would have
two hydrogens that

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,330
stick out like that.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,370
And then finally this guy will
also have three hydrogens, the

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,540
ch3, just like that.

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,430
Now, if we try to draw a Newman
Projection, here's

27
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,970
like, well, what do you consider
the front, or the

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,690
back, carbon in all of that.

29
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,950
And you actually can pick.

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,540
And what's interesting in a
butane molecule is, if you

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,830
pick this guy, so this is a one,
two, three, four carbon,

32
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,970
if you pick the two carbon as
our front, and our three

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,360
carbon as our back, and then we
viewed this carbon, the ch3

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,610
as kind of one of the add-ons
on to that carbon, you can

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,965
then do a Newman Projection.

36
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:37,080
So let's try to do this.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,660
So this'll be the front one.

38
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,370
So we'll put this carbon in the
front, and we'll put this

39
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,220
carbon over here, we'll
put this carbon

40
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,770
over here in the back.

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,530
And before I even draw the
Newman Projection, let me

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,650
redraw this.

43
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,660
But I'm just going to draw
this, instead of with the

44
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,340
hydrogens, the bonds, explicitly
defined, I'm just

45
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,000
going to call this a ch3.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,680
So let me redraw this.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,440
So I'll do this in orange.

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,970
So you have this carbon.

49
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,580
I'll do this as kind of as a
modified ball and stick.

50
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,670
So that carbon, it has a
hydrogen, it has that hydrogen

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,480
and that hydrogen.

52
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,120
And instead of drawing this out,
I'm going to just draw

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,670
this whole thing right here and
I'll do it in, I'll do it

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,730
in magenta.

55
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,110
I'm going to draw this whole
thing as just a ch3.

56
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,060
So I'm going to draw this whole
thing as just a ch3.

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,170
So I'll draw it really big,
because it's not just one

58
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,700
atom, it's four atoms.
So this is our ch3.

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,820
And, well, to do ball and stick
everything really should

60
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,430
be a ball, so I'll draw a ball
there, a ball there.

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,510
So that's our carbon number two,
and then it has this bond

62
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,500
over here to this carbon
number three.

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,070
Which, when we do our
Newman Projection,

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,560
we'll put in the back.

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,130
So our carbon number
three is like that.

66
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,110
And then the carbon number
three, it has two hydrogens,

67
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,620
and then it has this.

68
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,940
You can kind of view it as this
methyl group attached to

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,570
it, if you want.

70
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:16,250
It has this ch3 attached
to it right there.

71
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,820
So I'll do the ch3, I'll do
it in this blue color.

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,590
And so we could draw
it like this.

73
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,710
So the ch3 is coming off-- so
I'll draw it really big

74
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,600
because it's not
just one atom.

75
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,280
So it's a ch3.

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,910
And then you have your two
hydrogens and they're-- sorry,

77
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,120
you have your two hydrogens
down here.

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,580
So let me be very clear here.

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,120
This hydrogen and that hydrogen,
that's that hydrogen

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,100
and that hydrogen, this thing
here is that thing there.

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,820
That big ball right there
is this whole ball.

82
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,980
And then let me find
a-- I'll do green.

83
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:57,630
This hydrogen and this hydrogen
is this hydrogen and

84
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,780
this hydrogen.

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,730
And when you look at it this
way, now you say, oh, now I

86
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,450
can see how I would draw
a Newman Projection.

87
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,530
I put this in the front,
that in the back.

88
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,810
I treat this whole part of
the molecule as just a

89
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,810
group, if you will.

90
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,890
It is a group.

91
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,300
So lets do the Newman
Projection here.

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,910
And we can think about where
it's most stable.

93
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,279
So the way I've drawn it right
here-- I'll do this as the

94
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,940
front, this carbon
two is going to

95
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,300
be the front molecule.

96
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,540
So you have the ch3
group going down.

97
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,550
And then you have these
two hydrogens,

98
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,240
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,930
That's the front.

100
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,080
And in the back you have
this blue one.

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,510
You can imagine in the front, if
we want to, maybe I'll do a

102
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,350
little small orange
thing to show this

103
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,700
is the orange carbon.

104
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,520
And then the blue carbon is
going to be in the back.

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,490
The blue carbon is in the back,
I'll draw it like this.

106
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,680
So that's my blue carbon.

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,230
The way we've done it here, we
have a ch3 pointing straight

108
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,130
up, and then we have
our two hydrogens.

109
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,280
Now, just like we talked about
in the first video on Newman

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,220
Projections, all of these groups
have-- these hydrogens

111
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,820
have electron clouds
around them.

112
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,120
This whole ch3 group has
a larger electron

113
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,780
cloud around it.

114
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,740
It's a carbon atom
plus hydrogens.

115
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,220
They all want to get away
from each other.

116
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,380
The ch3 is even a
bigger molecule.

117
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,630
So to some degree, it's going
to play a bigger role in

118
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,220
whether something has a higher
or lower potential energy or

119
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,640
whether it's wound or not.

120
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,040
So I guess the most obvious, or
maybe it's not obvious, but

121
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,780
the ch3 groups, since they
have the biggest electron

122
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,200
crowd, they're kind of crowding
the molecule.

123
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,046
This ch3 group and this ch3
group, they're going to want

124
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:41,680
to get as far away from each
other as possible.

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,430
So the way we did this, it
looks kind of like our

126
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,890
staggered conformation, but when
we're dealing with actual

127
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,970
methyl groups that are separated
as far as they can

128
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,410
from each other, we
call this the

129
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,360
anti-conformation right here.

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,870
And if we think about dihedral
angles between the two methyl

131
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,975
groups, the dihedral angle
here is 180 degrees.

132
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,450
180 degrees dihedral angle.

133
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,370
And this is the lowest
potential

134
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,150
energy or the most stable.

135
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,120
And if that confuses you when I
talk about lowest potential

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,180
energy, just think about it.

137
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,380
A rock on the ground has a lower
potential energy than a

138
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,850
rock that is 50 feet
in the air.

139
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,100
A rock on the ground is
also more stable.

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,490
It's less likely to
do something.

141
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,040
Something 50 feet in the air,
maybe if you nudge it a little

142
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,980
bit, it'll fall off the cliff
or wherever it is.

143
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,210
Or maybe it's already falling.

144
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,580
Who knows?

145
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,750
It's going to move when you have
higher potential energy.

146
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,950
Or it takes very little for
it to release energy.

147
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,670
But when you have
lower potential

148
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,810
energy, you're more stable.

149
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,060
So this is the most stable
conformation.

150
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,110
Now what are the other
situations you could do here?

151
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,050
Well, you could keep rotating
these-- let's say we rotated

152
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,590
the back carbon around
clockwise, what are the other

153
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,310
conformations we could get?

154
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,700
And so let me just draw the
front portion right here.

155
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:17,210
So you have your ch3, and then
you have your two hydrogens,

156
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,395
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

157
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,860
And let me copy and
paste this.

158
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,160
So there's two other real-- I
mean, there's everything in

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,640
between, but these are the ones
that are interesting.

160
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,430
Control copy, and then let me
copy it, copy, and then paste.

161
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,670
So I'll actually draw
three of these.

162
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,950
So then you have that.

163
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,230
Then let me paste it one more
time, and then you have that.

164
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,250
So obviously this would
be the front

165
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,330
carbon in every situation.

166
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,755
If I want I could make it a
little orange dot to show that

167
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,870
that's the front carbon.

168
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,340
And then let me draw
the back carbon.

169
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,130
I should've copied and
pasted this as well.

170
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,325
So you have your back carbon
in every situation.

171
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:07,150
Now, if we were to rotate this
character by 60 degrees--

172
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,880
actually if we were to rotate
the back by 60 degrees, what

173
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,100
would it look like?

174
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,660
Well, then we would have-- this
hydrogen would move up

175
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,300
there-- so then you would
have this hydrogen.

176
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,220
Actually if we were to move it
by 120 degrees, I should say.

177
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,650
This would be 60, and then
another 120 degrees.

178
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,240
So this hydrogen would
go up there.

179
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,299
This methyl group would now be
over here, and then this

180
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,440
hydrogen would go over here.

181
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,550
So we've just rotated to this
whole thing by 120 degrees.

182
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,020
Now, this conformation,
this was called the

183
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,060
anti-conformation.

184
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,530
It's the most stable because
the carbon-- the methyl

185
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,300
groups, are as far away from
each other as possible.

186
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,110
This right here is called
the Gauche conformation.

187
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:04,590
Let me do this in a different--
and you can view

188
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,460
this as the second
most stable.

189
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,720
At least the methyls
are staggered.

190
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,470
They're not directly
behind each other.

191
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,540
So here the methyls are
as far apart from

192
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,450
each other as possible.

193
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,560
If you look at the ball and
stick model, I actually drew

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,140
it in that conformation
right here.

195
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,650
They're as far apart
from each other.

196
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,170
If you were to flip this
molecule, if you were to flip

197
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,570
it, this methyl would get closer
to this methyl, and

198
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,440
their electron clouds would
start to crowd each other.

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,270
So in this situation this
is anti, most stable.

200
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,960
If you rotate a little bit
they'll get a little bit

201
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,360
closer but they'll still
be staggered.

202
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,180
You get the Gauche
conformation.

203
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,070
Now, if we rotate this, if we
rotate the back guy now 60

204
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,350
degrees clockwise, what's
going to happen?

205
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,410
Well, then you're going to have
an eclipsed conformation,

206
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,320
where the carbons are directly,
but where the methyl

207
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,240
groups are directly
behind each other.

208
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,110
And that's going to be your
least stable situation.

209
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,430
Right?

210
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,380
So you'd have this guy-- and
I'll draw it slightly-- so

211
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,950
you'd have this guy, ch3 there,
and then you would have

212
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,720
your hydrogens that are right
behind each other.

213
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,000
So a hydrogen and a hydrogen.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,600
So in this situation where
eclipsed-- this is the least

215
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,080
stable, and also the most
potential energy.

216
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,160
And then if we were to go
another 60 degrees from this,

217
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,990
then we'd go to another
Gauche conformation.

218
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,430
If you rotate this another 60
degrees, then you'd have a ch3

219
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,750
here, and then you would have--
this hydrogen would be

220
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,730
up here, and then this
hydrogen here.

221
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,120
So this is staggered.

222
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,670
The methyl groups are, at least
they're not directly

223
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,990
behind each other, but they're
not as far as they could be if

224
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,060
we were to rotate another 120
degrees and get to the

225
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,460
anti-conformation.

226
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,520
So this one right here is also
a Gauche conformation.

227
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,020
So hopefully you understand
now that, you just have to

228
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,030
pick two carbons and then you
can, if there's, kind of, big

229
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,180
things attached to each of those
carbons, you can just

230
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,850
represent them as groups.

231
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,650
And when you do that-- you'd
use a Newman Projection for

232
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,400
any part of a molecule.

233
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,570
And when you do that, you can
start to think about how it

234
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,490
can rotate and what parts, or
what versions of it, will be more or less stable
