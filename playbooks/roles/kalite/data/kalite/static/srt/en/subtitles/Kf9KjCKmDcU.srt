1
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,409
Imagine two people who share an important secret

2
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:11,977
have to split up.

3
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,411
This requires them to communicate

4
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,053
private information from a distance.

5
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,240
However, an eavesdropper named Eve

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,653
also wants this information,

7
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:25,856
and has the ability to intercept their messages.

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,718
So, Alice decides to communicate

9
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:31,636
using letters written in some kind of secret code.

10
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,954
The following analogy is helpful.

11
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,421
First, Alice locks her message in a box,

12
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,026
using a lock that only she and Bob

13
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,951
know the combination to.

14
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,669
This is known as 'encryption.'

15
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:45,768
Then, the locked message is sent to Bob.

16
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:47,982
When Bob receives the box, he opens it

17
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:51,221
using the code they shared in advance.

18
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,792
This is called 'decryption.'

19
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,866
Cryptography begins when we abandon physical locks

20
00:00:57,866 --> 00:01:00,183
and use 'ciphers' instead.

21
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,862
Think of [ciphers] as virtual locks.

22
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,837
Ciphers allow Alice and Bob to scramble

23
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,534
and descramble their messages

24
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,222
so that they would appear meaningless

25
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:11,289
if Eve intercepted them.

26
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:13,956
Cryptography has been around for thousands of years.

27
00:01:13,956 --> 00:01:15,977
It has decided wars, and is at the heart of

28
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:18,917
the worldwide communication network today.

29
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,817
The fascinating story of cryptography

30
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:23,824
requires us to understand two very old ideas

31
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:28,134
related to number theory and probability theory.
