1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
   

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:05,820
We are on problem 17.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,290
Alice and Corinne stand
back-to-back.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:11,620
They each take 10 steps in
opposite directions away from

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,060
each other and stop.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,740
Alison turns around walks
towards Corinne and reaches

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,090
her in 17 steps.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,720
OK, so this is interesting.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,300
So they're back-to-back.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,775
Let's say Alice goes this way.

11
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,130
And let's say A is
for Alice steps.

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,740
So 10 Alice steps, we don't know
how long Alice steps are.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,540
And then Corinne had gone this
way and taken 10 Corinne

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,520
steps, right?

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,930
C is, I don't know how long she
takes per step, two feet?

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,970
Who knows?

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,850
But C is the distance of Corinne
steps in my little

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,410
world right here.

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,700
OK, so they took ten steps in
opposite directions from each

20
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,240
other and stopped.

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,730
Alison turns around and walks
towards Corinne and reaches

22
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,990
her in 17 steps.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,030
So this is where Corinne
is now, right?

24
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:07,380
So this whole distance here
is 17 Alice steps.

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,010
The length of one of Alice steps
is how many times the

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,920
length of one of Corinne's
steps?

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,580
And they say, all of Alice's
steps are the same length, and

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,990
all of Corinne's steps
are the same length.

29
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,390
Well we know a couple
of things.

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,680
We know to get to here
would have been 10

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Alice steps, right?

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,790
This would have been
10 Alice steps.

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,370
So essentially, in the same
distance that Corinne took 10

34
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,090
steps, Alice took what?

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,330
She took 7 steps, right?

36
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,500
She took 10 to get to the
middle, and then 7 more to get

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,476
to where Corinne is.

38
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,870
So this is 7 Alice steps.

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,470
So 7 times Alice step length is
equal to 10 times Corinne

40
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,830
step length, right?

41
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,610
I'm just saying 7a
is equal to 10c.

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,740
And what do we want to know?

43
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,280
We want to know the length of
one of Alice's steps is how

44
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,840
many times the length of
one of Corinne's steps?

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,770
So we want to solve for a.

46
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,786
So Alice's step is equal to--
divide both sides by 7-- is

47
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:01,520
equal to 10/7 times
a Corinne step.

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,460
And that's our answer, 10/7.

49
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:13,230
Next problem, problem 18.

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,390
Let the function f be defined
by f of x is equal to x

51
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,950
squared plus 18.

52
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:33,710
If m is a positive number such
that f of 2m is equal to 2 f

53
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,960
of m, what is the value of m?

54
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
A lot of people get intimidated
by these function

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,780
problems, but in some ways
they're kind of the most

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,490
straightforward problems.
You just have to sit

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,670
and evaluate them.

58
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,250
So what's f of 2m?

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,670
So everywhere we see
an x, we put a 2m.

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,730
So it's 2m squared
plus 18, right?

61
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,115
Wherever I saw an
x, I put a 2m.

62
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:58,475
And that equals 2
times f of m.

63
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,200
So wherever I see an
x, I put an m.

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,360
So that's m squared plus 18.

65
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,870
Now I just simplify.

66
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,510
2m squared, that's equal to 4m
squared plus 18 is equal to 2m

67
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,680
squared plus 36.

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,760
I just distributed the 2.

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,100
So you subtract 2m squared from
both sides, you get 2m

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,870
squared plus 18 is
equal to 36.

71
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,060
I subtracted this
from both sides.

72
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,590
Subtract 18 from both
sides, you get 2m

73
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,090
squared is equal to 18.

74
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,110
Divide both sides by 2, you get
m squared is equal to 9.

75
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,180
And then you get m is equal
to-- if you just did this

76
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,850
straight off, you'd get
plus or minus 3.

77
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,920
But they tell us that m is a
positive number, so we know

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,780
that m is equal to 3.

79
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,162
And we are done.

80
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,280
And that's it.

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,440
I'll see you in the
next section.

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:54,800
