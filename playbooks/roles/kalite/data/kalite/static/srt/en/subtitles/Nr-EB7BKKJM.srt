1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,450
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,820
We're now going to be in the next section,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,980
section four in our fourth test.

4
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,280
And that's problem one, 594.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,950
Problem one.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,520
x minus y is equal to 8. y is equal to 3z.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,260
And z is equal to 2. What is x?

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,170
z is equal to 2, y is equal to 3z, so y is equal to 6.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,720
So x minus 6 is equal to 8, or x is equal to 14.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,500
E.

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,960
I already said z is equal to 2.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,910
I sometimes forget when I just said.

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,070
Maybe I'm aging.

14
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,340
Problem number two.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,650
Todd is older than Marta,but younger than Susan.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,920
Let's say their first letter is their age.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,570
Say Todd is older than Marta,

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,120
so his age is greater than Marta.

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,590
But he's also younger than Susan,

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,260
so his age is less than Susan's age.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,520
Oh I think I did this problem inadvertantly.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,530
If t, m, and s represent the ages in years of Todd, Marta,

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,680
and Susan respectively, which of the following is true?

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,690
And exactly what I drew is choice A.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,560
And this comes straight from their statements.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,740
I literally was just writing this

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,510
because I thought they were going to ask something harder.

28
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,570
But this they're saying Todd is older than Marta,

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,160
so t is greater than m.

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,420
And Todd is younger than Susan,so t is less than s,

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,900
so that's just choice A.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Problem number three.

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,720
If the areas of two regions are equal,

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,700
and the sum of the areas of the regions is 5,

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,370
what is the average of the areas of the two regions?

36
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,740
So area 1 equals area 2. We know that.

37
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,520
And we also know that the sum of the areas is 5.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,440
So area 1 plus area 2 is equal to 5.

39
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,720
But then, of course,

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
we know that area 2 is the same thing as area 1.

41
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,120
So we also know that area 1 times 2 is equal to 5,

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,820
or that each of the areas is 2.5.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,850
And area 2 would also be 2.5.

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,840
We know that because they're equal to each other,

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,560
and when you add them up it's 5.

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,400
So they're each going to be half of that,

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,710
so they're each 2 and 1/2.

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,560
And they want to know,

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,920
what is the average of the areas in the two regions?

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,380
Well they're the same number, right?

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,000
So if you average two of the same number,

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,620
the average is going to be that number.

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,030
You could add them and divide by 2,

54
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,290
but you're going to get 2.5.

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,350
And if you look at the choices, where's 2.5?

56
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,550
2.5 is the same thing as 2 and 1/2,

57
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,470
which is the same thing as 5/2, so it's choice B.

58
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,030
Next problem. I'll switch colors. Problem number four.

59
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,050
Let s be the set of all integers

60
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,740
that can be written as n squared plus 1,

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,450
where n is a non zero integer.

62
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,680
N is greater than zero,

63
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,700
and it soon. is an integer, it is a non zero integer.

64
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,690
Which of the following integers is an s?

65
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,320
So n squared plus 1.

66
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,180
So let's get a feel for what it is.

67
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,260
When n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

68
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,230
When n is 1, n squared,plus 1 is 2.

69
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,890
2 squared plus 1 is 5. 3 squared plus 1 is 10.

70
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,030
4 squared plus 1 is 17.

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,080
It's always going to be one more than a perfect square.

72
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,090
25 plus 1 is 26. There's 37, right?

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,070
So the choice is,it has to be one more than a perfect square.

74
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,800
So which of the following integers is an s?

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,850
So choice A is 16.

76
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,620
16 is a perfect square,

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,160
but it's not one more than a perfect square.

78
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,680
Similarly, choice B, 28.

79
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,870
28 minus 1 is 27, that's not a perfect square.

80
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,450
35 minus 1 isn't a perfect square.

81
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,170
39 minus 1 isn't a perfect square.

82
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,930
And if you look at choice E, 50.

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,150
50 minus 1 is 49, which is,of course, 7 squared.

84
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,410
Actually we would have gotten there

85
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,440
if we had just done one more.

86
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,340
7 squared plus 1, 49 plus 1, is equal to 50.

87
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,600
The important thing to realize is that,

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,220
the integers in s are integers

89
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,830
that are one more than a perfect square.

90
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,250
So you just have to look at the choices and say,

91
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,340
which of these is one more than a perfect square?

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,690
Let's do problem number five.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,290
So I have a circle here,that's my circle.

94
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,410
And it has a triangle inside the circle.

95
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,240
It looks something--

96
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,310
I try to draw these as close to what

97
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,680
they drew in the book as possible.

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,350
There's point like that, there's point like that,

99
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,730
and then there's a triangle that looks like that.

100
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,740
And they write this is the center, of course, is o.

101
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,490
They're saying that this right here is x.

102
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,930
They say that this right here is y.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,110
And then the question reads, in the figure above,

104
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,230
point o is the center of the circle.

105
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,930
If x is equal to 40 degrees,what is the value of y?

106
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,170
And you'll be like, how do I figure this out?

107
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,390
I know the angles of a triangle add up to 180,

108
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,070
and all that, but they've only given me one angle.

109
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,910
And I don't know the angle.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,540
Or so you think you don't know this angle.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,530
One of the things that should immediately enter your mind

112
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,690
when you see this in the SAT is,

113
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,180
the sides of this triangle are the radius of the circle.

114
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,670
It's the radius of the circle.

115
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,860
Because every time it gets to the end point,

116
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,970
and they actually it draw like that.

117
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,470
So if this is the radius,

118
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,540
we know that this side is going to be equal to this side.

119
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,630
Because both of these sides

120
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,060
are the length of the radius of the circle.

121
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,690
And they do this a lot in the SAT.

122
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,750
If something is a radius of a circle, it never changes.

123
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,650
Anywhere you draw it.

124
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,230
The radius is constant as you go around the circle.

125
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,650
So if this side is equal to this side,

126
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,050
what do we know happens?

127
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,150
It's an isosceles triangle, and the base angles are equal.

128
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,910
So this is y, we also know that this is y.

129
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,010
Because they're the base angles.

130
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,800
You know they're corresponding angles to these two sides.

131
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,660
They're the base angles for this triangle.

132
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,060
Now we can solve it.

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,640
We could say, x, which is 40 degrees,

134
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,050
plus y plus y is equal to 180.

135
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,570
Or we could say 40 plus 2y is equal to 180.

136
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,310
2y is equal to 140. Y is equal to 70 degrees.

137
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,900
And that is choice D.

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,010
Next problem. Problem number 6.

139
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,320
A simple square is any integer greater than 1

140
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,980
that has only three positive integer factors.

141
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,960
Itself, its square root, and 1.

142
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,690
Which of the following is a simple square?

143
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,480
It can only have three factors, it can't anything else.

144
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,990
So, for example,

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:22,020
if we wrote all of the perfect squares. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36.

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,310
If we write the factors, this factor only has 1.

147
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,960
This factor has 1, 2 and 4. This has 1, 3 and 9.

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,170
I'm just writing out all the factors.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,790
1, 2, and 4.

150
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,140
So it would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

151
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,510
I'm just doing this as an example.

152
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,870
You shouldn't do this on the SAT.

153
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,580
But I want to explain what they're saying.

154
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,080
All of these numbers are perfect squares,right?

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,270
But notice 16 has itself, 1,and it has some extra factors.

156
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,410
While these numbers only have its square root,

157
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,460
and themselves, and 1 as factors.

158
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,690
So these are simple squares.

159
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,150
So if we look at the choices,choice A, 121.

160
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,930
121, I know 1 is a factor,I know that's 11 squared.

161
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,690
I know it's 121.

162
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,430
And I think, other than that,there's not any other factors.

163
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,630
It's not divisible by 3. B is 100.

164
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,260
100's got a ton of factors.

165
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,730
I mean it's got 1,10, and 100. It also has 2 and 50.

166
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,520
It has 4 and 25,

167
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,770
it has a ton of factors other than its square root,

168
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,700
so it's not choice B.

169
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,030
Choice C, 81, same thing.

170
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:43,670
It could be 1, 1 times 81,it could be 9 times 9.

171
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,750
Or it could be 27 times 3,and so forth and so on.

172
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,710
So it's not choice C. I think A is our prime contender.

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,600
Choice D, 64.

174
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,420
Once again, tons of factors outside of its square root.

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,550
It has 1, 64, and 8. But it also has 2 times 32.

176
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,190
It has 4 times 16, and you could go on.

177
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,380
64 has a ton of factors. And, finally, choice E.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,770
33.

179
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,880
E doesn't work, because that's not even a perfect sqaure.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,660
What squared equals 33? I don't know.

181
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,430
So that doesn't even work.

182
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,110
So it's definitely choice A.

183
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,600
Next problem. Actually I only have 40 seconds left,

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,710
so I'll do it in the next video.

185
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,010
See you soon.
