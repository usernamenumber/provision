1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,985
We're asked to convert 10 to the second power,

2
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:08,104
or 10 squared, equals 100 into a logarithmic equation.

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:12,817
Now this is saying, if I take base 10-- so I'll do 10 in yellow --

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:19,770
I take the base 10 to the exponent 2, then I get 100.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,567
When you do a logarithm, it is really kind of the inverse of that,

6
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:25,840
it is really kind of the other way of thinking about it.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:37,361
A logarithm says: "what power do I have to raise the base to, to get 100?"

8
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:45,372
So if I were to write log, base 10, of 100-- and I wrote the ten a little bit bigger than is typically done,

9
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:50,037
let me write it this way-- log base 10 of 100, this says

10
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:55,769
what power do I have to raise 10 to, my base, to get 100?

11
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,914
And we know from this, and probably you knew this even if we didn't have this written down,

12
00:00:58,914 --> 00:01:01,839
you would have to raise it to the second power.

13
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,316
So this is equal to 2.

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,838
So right over here we are saying in an exponential equation, the base ten, to the second power

15
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,505
is equal to 100. Here in the logarithmic equation we are

16
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:22,105
saying that the power that we have to raise 10 to to get 100 is equal to 2.

17
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:27,371
So these are really saying the exact same thing.

18
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:31,304
And just so you get the terminology right, this, in both cases,

19
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:35,706
the ten is referred to as the base, this is the base,

20
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:39,234
and in both cases the 2, -- let me write it--

21
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:47,402
so in both cases the 2 is referred to, and I think you know this already, as the exponent.

22
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:52,105
And then the 100 is what you get when you raise the base to the exponent.

23
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:56,105
So these are two ways of writing the exact same truth about 10 to the second power equaling 100.
