1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,610
In this video, I'm going to
expose you to what is maybe

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,860
one of at least the top five
most useful formulas in

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,550
mathematics.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,460
And if you've seen many of my
videos, you know that I'm not

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,660
a big fan of memorizing
things.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,400
But I will recommend you
memorize it with the caveat

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,776
that you also remember how to
prove it, because I don't want

9
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:22,940
you to just remember
things and not know

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,870
where they came from.

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,970
But with that said, let me
show you what I'm talking

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,330
about: it's the quadratic
formula.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,620
And as you might guess, it is to
solve for the roots, or the

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,900
zeroes of quadratic equations.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,450
So let's speak in very general
terms and I'll

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,850
show you some examples.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,360
So let's say I have an equation
of the form ax

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,070
squared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,620
You should recognize this.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,450
This is a quadratic equation
where a, b and c are-- Well, a

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,730
is the coefficient on the x
squared term or the second

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,540
degree term, b is the
coefficient on the x term and

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,270
then c, is, you could imagine,
the coefficient on the x to

24
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,550
the zero term, or it's
the constant term.

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,550
Now, given that you have a
general quadratic equation

26
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,700
like this, the quadratic formula
tells us that the

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:24,100
solutions to this equation are
x is equal to negative b plus

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:32,020
or minus the square root of
b squared minus 4ac, all

29
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,530
of that over 2a.

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,490
And I know it seems crazy and
convoluted and hard for you to

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,160
memorize right now, but as you
get a lot more practice you'll

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,170
see that it actually is a pretty
reasonable formula to

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,300
stick in your brain someplace.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,570
And you might say, gee, this is
a wacky formula, where did

35
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,340
it come from?

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,660
And in the next video I'm
going to show you

37
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,260
where it came from.

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,920
But I want you to get used to
using it first. But it really

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,670
just came from completing
the square on this

40
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,750
equation right there.

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,880
If you complete the square here,
you're actually going to

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,250
get this solution and that
is the quadratic

43
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,390
formula, right there.

44
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,949
So let's apply it to some
problems. Let's start off with

45
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,680
something that we could have
factored just to verify that

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
it's giving us the
same answer.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,660
So let's say we have x
squared plus 4x minus

48
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,890
21 is equal to 0.

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,230
So in this situation-- let me
do that in a different color

50
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,370
--a is equal to 1, right?

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,415
The coefficient on the
x squared term is 1.

52
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,790
   

53
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,910
b is equal to 4, the coefficient
on the x-term.

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,240
And then c is equal
to negative 21,

55
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,470
the constant term.

56
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,860
And let's just plug it in the
formula, so what do we get?

57
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,470
We get x, this tells us that
x is going to be equal to

58
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,200
negative b.

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,346
Negative b is negative 4-- I put
the negative sign in front

60
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:05,660
of that --negative b
plus or minus the

61
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,770
square root of b squared.

62
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,230
b squared is 16, right?

63
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:20,170
4 squared is 16, minus 4 times
a, which is 1, times c, which

64
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,870
is negative 21.

65
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,750
So we can put a 21 out there
and that negative sign will

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,790
cancel out just like that with
that-- Since this is the first

67
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,400
time we're doing it, let me
not skip too many steps.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,800
So negative 21, just so you
can see how it fit in, and

69
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,330
then all of that over 2a.

70
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,760
a is 1, so all of that over 2.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,460
So what does this simplify, or
hopefully it simplifies?

72
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,120
So we get x is equal to negative
4 plus or minus the

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,110
square root of-- Let's see we
have a negative times a

74
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,890
negative, that's going to
give us a positive.

75
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,470
And we had 16 plus, let's see
this is 6, 4 times 1 is 4

76
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,160
times 21 is 84.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,380
16 plus 84 is 100.

78
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,810
That's nice.

79
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,180
That's a nice perfect square.

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,380
All of that over 2, and so this
is going to be equal to

81
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,160
negative 4 plus or
minus 10 over 2.

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,060
We could just divide both of
these terms by 2 right now.

83
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,840
So this is equal to negative 4
divided by 2 is negative 2

84
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,000
plus or minus 10 divided
by 2 is 5.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,490
So that tells us that x could be
equal to negative 2 plus 5,

86
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,930
which is 3, or x could be equal
to negative 2 minus 5,

87
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,240
which is negative 7.

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,420
So the quadratic formula
seems to have given us

89
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,500
an answer for this.

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,240
You can verify just by
substituting back in that

91
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,840
these do work, or you could even
just try to factor this

92
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,610
right here.

93
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,110
You say what two numbers when
you take their product, you

94
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,230
get negative 21 and when you
take their sum you get

95
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,200
positive 4?

96
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,740
So you'd get x plus 7
times x minus 3 is

97
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,690
equal to negative 21.

98
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,970
Notice 7 times negative 3 is
negative 21, 7 minus 3 is

99
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,160
positive 4.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,850
You would get x plus-- sorry
it's not negative --21 is

101
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,590
equal to 0.

102
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,890
There should be a 0 there.

103
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,380
So you get x plus 7 is equal
to 0, or x minus

104
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,810
3 is equal to 0.

105
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,850
X could be equal to negative
7 or x could be equal to 3.

106
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,390
So it definitely gives us the
same answer as factoring, so

107
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,700
you might say, hey why bother
with this crazy mess?

108
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,140
And the reason we want to bother
with this crazy mess is

109
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,150
it'll also work for problems
that are hard to factor.

110
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,210
And let's do a couple of
those, let's do some

111
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,080
hard-to-factor problems
right now.

112
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,410
So let's scroll down to get
some fresh real estate.

113
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,150
Let's rewrite the formula again,
just in case we haven't

114
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,580
had it memorized yet. x is going
to be equal to negative

115
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,180
b plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac,

116
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,480
all of that over 2a.

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,540
I'll supply this to
another problem.

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:30,320
Let's say we have the equation
3x squared plus 6x is equal to

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,720
negative 10.

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,610
Well, the first thing we want
to do is get it in the form

121
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,980
where all of our terms or on the
left-hand side, so let's

122
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,450
add 10 to both sides
of this equation.

123
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:46,680
We get 3x squared plus the
6x plus 10 is equal to 0.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,930
And now we can use a
quadratic formula.

125
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,320
So let's apply it here.

126
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,050
So a is equal to 3.

127
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,900
That is a, this is b and
this right here is c.

128
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,870
So the quadratic formula
tells us the

129
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,060
solutions to this equation.

130
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,570
The roots of this quadratic
function, I guess

131
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,570
we could call it.

132
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,300
x is going to be equal
to negative b.

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,920
b is 6, so negative 6
plus or minus the

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,350
square root of b squared.

135
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:29,270
b is 6, so we get 6 squared
minus 4 times a, which is 3

136
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,630
times c, which is 10.

137
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,050
Let's stretch out the radical
little bit, all of that over 2

138
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,190
times a, 2 times 3.

139
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:46,380
So we get x is equal to negative
6 plus or minus the

140
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:57,320
square root of 36 minus-- this
is interesting --minus 4 times

141
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,090
3 times 10.

142
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:05,690
So this is minus-- 4
times 3 times 10.

143
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,500
So this is minus 120.

144
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,010
All of that over 6.

145
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,750
So this is interesting, you
might already realize why it's

146
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,220
interesting.

147
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,970
What is this going
to simplify to?

148
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,610
36 minus 120 is what?

149
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:30,630
That's 84.

150
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,860
We make this into a 10,
this will become an

151
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,159
11, this is a 4.

152
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,590
It is 84, so this is going to be
equal to negative 6 plus or

153
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,799
minus the square root of-- But
not positive 84, that's if

154
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
it's 120 minus 36.

155
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,920
We have 36 minus 120.

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,630
It's going to be negative
84 all of that 6.

157
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,140
So you might say, gee,
this is crazy.

158
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,930
What a this silly quadratic
formula you're

159
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,000
introducing me to, Sal?

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,790
It's worthless.

161
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,020
It just gives me a square root
of a negative number.

162
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,380
It's not giving me an answer.

163
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,750
And the reason why it's not
giving you an answer, at least

164
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,450
an answer that you might want,
is because this will have no

165
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,700
real solutions.

166
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,910
   

167
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,260
In the future, we're going to
introduce something called an

168
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,310
imaginary number, which is a
square root of a negative

169
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,720
number, and then we can actually
express this in terms

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,810
of those numbers.

171
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,540
So this actually does have
solutions, but they involve

172
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,660
imaginary numbers.

173
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,690
So this actually has no real
solutions, we're taking the

174
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,760
square root of a negative
number.

175
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,280
So the b squared with the b
squared minus 4ac, if this

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,330
term right here is negative,
then you're not going to have

177
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,290
any real solutions.

178
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,610
And let's verify that
for ourselves.

179
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,240
Let's get our graphic calculator
out and let's graph

180
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,600
this equation right here.

181
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,710
So, let's get the graphs that y
is equal to-- that's what I

182
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:10,510
had there before --3x squared
plus 6x plus 10.

183
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,920
So that's the equation and we're
going to see where it

184
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,210
intersects the x-axis.

185
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,370
Where does it equal 0?

186
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,150
So let me graph it.

187
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,510
   

188
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,700
Notice, this thing just comes
down and then goes back up.

189
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,880
Its vertex is sitting here
above the x-axis and it's

190
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,710
upward-opening.

191
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,290
It never intersects
the x-axis.

192
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,262
So at no point will this
expression, will this

193
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:34,650
function, equal 0.

194
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,530
At no point will y equal
0 on this graph.

195
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,700
So once again, the quadratic
formula seems to be working.

196
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,710
Let's do one more example,
you can ever see

197
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,730
enough examples here.

198
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,300
And I want to do ones that are,
you know, maybe not so

199
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,160
obvious to factor.

200
00:10:52,160 --> 00:11:01,930
So let's say we get negative 3x
squared plus 12x plus 1 is

201
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,770
equal to 0.

202
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,450
Now let's try to do it just
having the quadratic formula

203
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,740
in our brain.

204
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,290
So the x's that satisfy this
equation are going to be

205
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,690
negative b.

206
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,580
This is b So negative b is
negative 12 plus or minus the

207
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:27,300
square root of b squared, of
144, that's b squared minus 4

208
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,870
times a, which is negative 3
times c, which is 1, all of

209
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,540
that over 2 times a, over
2 times negative 3.

210
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,970
So all of that over negative 6,
this is going to be equal

211
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,630
to negative 12 plus or
minus the square root

212
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,030
of-- What is this?

213
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,710
It's a negative times a negative
so they cancel out.

214
00:11:51,710 --> 00:12:01,220
So I have 144 plus 12, so
that is 156, right?

215
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,910
144 plus 12, all of that
over negative 6.

216
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,350
Now, I suspect we can
simplify this 156.

217
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,270
We could maybe bring
some things out

218
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,850
of the radical sign.

219
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,170
So let's attempt to do that.

220
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,020
So let's do a prime
factorization of 156.

221
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,600
Sometimes, this is the hardest
part, simplifying the radical.

222
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,080
So 156 is the same thing
as 2 times 78.

223
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,950
78 is the same thing
as 2 times what?

224
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,800
That's 2 times 39.

225
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,960
So the square root of 156 is
equal to the square root of 2

226
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,800
times 2 times 39 or we could say
that's the square root of

227
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,110
2 times 2 times the
square root of 39.

228
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,810
And this, obviously, is just
going to be the square root of

229
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,830
4 or this is the square root
of 2 times 2 is just 2.

230
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,310
2 square roots of 39, if I
did that properly, let's

231
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,710
see, 4 times 39.

232
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,150
Yeah, it looks like
it's right.

233
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:17,590
So this up here will simplify to
negative 12 plus or minus 2

234
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:23,220
times the square root of 39, all
of that over negative 6.

235
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,650
Now we can divide the numerator
and the denominator

236
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,590
maybe by 2.

237
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:32,060
So this will be equal to
negative 6 plus or minus the

238
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,020
square root of 39
over negative 3.

239
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,540
Or we could separate these
two terms out.

240
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,800
We could say this is equal to
negative 6 over negative 3

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,310
plus or minus the square root
of 39 over negative 3.

242
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,400
Now, this is just a 2
right here, right?

243
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,190
These cancel out, 6 divided
by 3 is 2, so we get 2.

244
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,810
And now notice, if this is plus
and we use this minus

245
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,780
sign, the plus will become
negative and the negative will

246
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,160
become positive.

247
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,390
But it still doesn't
matter, right?

248
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,260
We could say minus or plus,
that's the same thing as plus

249
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,010
or minus the square root
of 39 nine over 3.

250
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,940
I think that's about as simple
as we can get this answered.

251
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,620
I want to make a very clear
point of what I

252
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,420
did that last step.

253
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,530
I did not forget about
this negative sign.

254
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,430
I just said it doesn't matter.

255
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,190
It's going to turn the positive
into the negative;

256
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,800
it's going to turn the negative
into the positive.

257
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,140
Let me rewrite this.

258
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,660
So this right here can be
rewritten as 2 plus the square

259
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:36,210
root of 39 over negative 3 or 2
minus the square root of 39

260
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,080
over negative 3, right?

261
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,610
That's what the plus or minus
means, it could be this or

262
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,600
that or both of them, really.

263
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,430
Now in this situation, this
negative 3 will turn into 2

264
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,290
minus the square root
of 39 over 3, right?

265
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,150
I'm just taking this
negative out.

266
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,130
Here the negative and the
negative will become a

267
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,090
positive, and you get 2
plus the square root

268
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,210
of 39 over 3, right?

269
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,130
A negative times a negative
is a positive.

270
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,400
So once again, you have
2 plus or minus the

271
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,190
square of 39 over 3.

272
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,550
2 plus or minus the square
root of 39 over 3 are

273
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,795
solutions to this equation
right there.

274
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:17,300
Let verify.

275
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm just curious what the
graph looks like.

276
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,360
So let's just look at it.

277
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,860
Let me clear this.

278
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,670
Where is the clear button?

279
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:37,280
So we have negative 3 three
squared plus 12x plus 1 and

280
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,721
let's graph it.

281
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,280
Let's see where it intersects
the x-axis.

282
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,180
It goes up there and then
back down again.

283
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,840
So 2 plus or minus the square,
you see-- The square root of

284
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,330
39 is going to be a little
bit more than 6, right?

285
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,090
Because 36 is 6 squared.

286
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,910
So it's going be a little bit
more than 6, so this is going

287
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,110
to be a little bit
more than 2.

288
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,890
A little bit more than 6 divided
by 2 is a little bit

289
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,615
more than 2.

290
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,580
So you're going to get one value
that's a little bit more

291
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,100
than 4 and then another value
that should be a little bit

292
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,690
less than 1.

293
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,590
And that looks like the case,
you have 1, 2, 3, 4.

294
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:18,460
You have a value that's pretty
close to 4, and then you have

295
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:25,020
another value that is a little
bit-- It looks close to 0 but

296
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,540
maybe a little bit
less than that.

297
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,090
So anyway, hopefully you found
this application of the

298
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,260
quadratic formula helpful.

299
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,733
