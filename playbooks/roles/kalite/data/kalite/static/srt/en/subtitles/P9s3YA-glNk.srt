2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,057
Dr. Steven Zucker: Giotto is not a Renaissance painter

3
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:08,057
but his laying that foundation

4
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:11,003
--20 perhaps 30 years after Cimabue painted

5
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:14,237
the large altar piece for Santa Trinita

6
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:18,588
Giotto--his student--paints the Madonna and child enthroned as well

7
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:21,606
that we think came from the Church of Ognissanti in Florence

8
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:25,591
Dr. Beth Harris: And this is a Mary like none we have seen before

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:30,424
she occupies space--she has a monumentality

10
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:32,674
and presence--and physicality

11
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:35,021
Dr. Zucker: It's totally different from anything

12
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,470
that we saw at the end of the 1200s

13
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,543
--if you think about Cimabue or even if you think about Duccio in Siena

14
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:43,126
--there's kind of delicacy--a kind of elegance

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,985
that those are figures that are almost paper thin

16
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:50,483
--and here Giotto's Madonna is solid--she weighs a lot

17
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,669
--there's no knocking her over

18
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:56,023
Dr. Harris: No--and it's not just the size of her body

19
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,634
it's also that use of modeling that we see

20
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,226
Dr. Zucker: Light and shadow

21
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,976
--the turn of a body that created by the transition

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,275
from highlights to shade

23
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,988
Dr. Harris: Exactly--which we can see in her neck

24
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:11,571
--around her breasts--pulling the drapery

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,172
across toward the Christ child

26
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,869
Dr. Zucker: We see that in the Christ child as well

27
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,470
and even in the angels around her

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,788
this is so different from that real sense of flatness

29
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,499
or the sense of drawing

30
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:21,933
this seems much more sculptural

31
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,968
Dr. Harris: With Giotta--we have a really sense of Mary

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,085
sitting inside her throne

33
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,669
--her knees are clearly foreshortened

34
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:30,497
--if you look back at the Duccio

35
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,467
--she turns her body so that he thighs

36
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,766
are parallel to the picture plane

37
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:37,249
--but the knees in Giotto's Madonna

38
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,982
come forward toward us creating an illusion of space

39
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,828
Dr. Zucker: Ya--it's true and then of course

40
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:45,215
there's a little bit more of a rational space

41
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,967
for her to exist in

42
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,851
--this is not a painting that uses linear perspective

43
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,754
but it is a painting that functions as a precursor in some ways

44
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:54,285
--I mean look for example at the specificness

45
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,712
with which the artist places us--the viewer

46
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:00,423
in relationship to the architecture that he is portraying

47
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:02,518
--now if you look at it carefully

48
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,901
clearly we are looking down from the step in the foreground

49
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,142
--but we are looking up at the ceiling of the throne

50
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:10,975
--and there's a left-right axis as well

51
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:13,663
--we can see a little bit more of the window

52
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:16,678
on the right side--so we know that we're actually favored

53
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,249
on the left a little bit--and so it makes sense

54
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,949
that we are just below Christ

55
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,577
and we are just to his left

56
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,629
-so Giotto is placing us in a very particular

57
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,974
point in relation to these divine figures

58
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:29,698
--and it is making room for us

59
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,934
Dr. Harris: As individuals--as viewers

60
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,392
Dr. Zucker: Giving us a kind of dignity in relationship to the divine

61
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:37,700
--and that is an inherently Renaissance idea

62
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,215
--and what I think is really remarkable

63
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:43,664
is that the Old Testament prophets that we saw in the Cimabue

64
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,850
are now brought out of the basement

65
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,960
and they flank the Virgin Mary

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,344
--and we can actually see their faces--at least two of them

67
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:53,329
framed in the wings of the throne itself

68
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,412
--so it's as if Giotto was actually suggesting to us

69
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:58,522
that a painting can be a kind of window

70
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,801
that we can look into--that we can look through

71
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:03,259
--and that a painting is a kind of frame

72
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,737
in which we can enter with our eyes

73
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:08,122
Dr. Harris: That's the reason that Giotto's painting

74
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,393
has a kind of emotional power

75
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:13,343
--even within this very traditional composition

76
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:16,076
all of that use of gold--all of these things

77
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:17,818
that are still Medieval

78
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,221
Giotto is--literally--making room

79
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,811
Dr. Zucker: In a sense--making a space for us in this room

80
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,044
because this a world that we can inhabit

81
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:27,286
this is place that we know where there are solids

82
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:28,944
--where there is gravity

83
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,643
--where there is in a sense all

84
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,460
the physical forces that our bodies contend with

85
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,740
--and we're able to inhabit this space

86
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,502
in a much more direct way

87
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:38,388
than in the previous paintings

88
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,537
Dr. Harris: So she's in heaven but she's still here with us

89
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:44,011
Dr. Zucker: That basic conflict will power

90
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:46,565
the Renaissance for the next several hundred years

91
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:49,478
--how to we bring together our physical experience

92
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,334
and our understanding--our emotional attachment

93
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:54,244
to the divine

94
00:03:54,244 --> 00:04:09,652
