1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,372
In this video,we are going to take the definition of bronsted-lowry acids and bases that we define

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:07,926
in the last video,and we're gonna use it to explore concepts of

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:11,833
Keq,Ka and also pKa,and see how

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,177
they are important when you're talking about acid-base chemistry

5
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:19,935
so here we have a generic acid-base reaction that uses the bronsted-lowry

6
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,103
definition.So,HA is our generic acid

7
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:26,768
it's going to donate a proton to H2O

8
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:31,103
H2O IS A bronsted-lowry base,if H2O accepts a proton

9
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:35,452
h2o becomes h3o+,and if HA

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,901
donates a proton,so it's left with,uh,if it loses

11
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,170
proton it's left with A- the conjugate base,like that

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,910
so when the reaction reaches equilibrium,the rate of the forward reaction is

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,593
equal to the rate of the reverse reaction,and from general

14
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:54,192
chemistry,the position of the equilibrium is described by what's called a

15
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:58,848
Ka/Keq expression,which is defined as the concentration

16
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:02,600
of the products over the concentration of the reactants

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,236
so if I were to write a Keq expression for this generic

18
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:10,633
acid-base reaction,I would take the concentration of the products

19
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,797
so I go ahead and put H3O+ times A-

20
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:18,307
and I put that over the concentration of my reactants,so it should be

21
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:22,636
HA AND H2O.Now the concentration

22
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:26,172
of water is constant,and so you can

23
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:29,902
think about it just being removed from the Keq expression,or you can think about

24
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:33,636
combining the concentration of water with the Keq to give you what's called

25
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:38,047
a Ka expression.So a Ka expression would have

26
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:42,173
the concentration of H3O+times the concentration

27
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:45,840
of A- over the concentration of

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,125
HA,since we've taken out water from our expression.

29
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,572
Now the useful what of Ka expression

30
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:57,127
I think it's much more obvious when you apply it to an actual

31
00:01:57,127 --> 00:02:00,970
reaction,so the one we talked about in the last video,right,

32
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,505
had H2O and HCl

33
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:09,048
where HCl donated a proton to

34
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:12,718
H2O.This reaction is technically at equilibrium,but the

35
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:15,236
equilibrium lies to the right here,so H2O

36
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:20,179
will become H3O+,so gained a proton

37
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:23,905
and if hcl loses its proton,it will be cl-

38
00:02:23,905 --> 00:02:28,634
so we talk about the equilibrium line to the right,which will mean

39
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:32,439
that we'll get ,uh, way more products than reactants

40
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,165
and so if we go ahead and write the Ka expression for this

41
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:39,626
acid-base reaction,let's go ahead and do it,the Ka

42
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:44,383
expression is equal to the concentration of my products over my concentration of the reactants

43
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,798
so for this reaction,the Ka will be equal to H3O+

44
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:51,902
times the concentration of Cl-

45
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:57,241
right,all over the concentration of HCl

46
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,051
and since HCl is a strong

47
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:04,102
acid,the equilibrium lies

48
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,970
to the right,which means we're going to get a extremely high concentration

49
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,637
of our products,compared to our reactants

50
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:15,842
and so the actual number turns out to be approximately

51
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:19,905
ten to the seventh for the concentration of my product

52
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:23,837
using my Ka expression over one,so

53
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:27,637
ten to the seventh over 1,so ten to the seventh is a extremely large number

54
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:31,385
which again makes sense because HCl is so strong

55
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:35,241
what what a very high concentration of products to reactants

56
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:43,129
that's what the Ka expression does,it tells you a relative idea about the strength of the acid

57
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,466
and in this case HCl is very strong,so HCl is strong

58
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:50,434
we know this just by looking at the Ka expression getting a value

59
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:53,717
of 10^7/1

60
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:58,377
that is a very large number ,and usually when you are doing Ka values,you get extremely

61
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:02,637
large numbers or extremely small numbers,which can be kind of annoying,when you're

62
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:06,239
doing math or when you are just talking about the acidity of a compound

63
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,719
so since that's annoying,chemistry takes what's called

64
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,962
the pKa value instead of the Ka value,especially organic chemistry

65
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,884
will tend to favor pKa values over Ka values

66
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,794
the way to calculate a pKa value it's like finding the pH of

67
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:26,649
something,so if you remember from what the pH is equal to the negative

68
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,830
log of the concentration of the hydronium ion,right?That's a way

69
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,646
of giving you numbers that are easier to work with,that's the exact same concept

70
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:37,573
here.So if I were to find the pKa,right,the pKa

71
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:41,227
would be equal to the negative log of the Ka.

72
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,393
the negative log of the Ka,so for HCl

73
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:50,046
we will plug in our number here,so we will plug in 10^7

74
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,730
so let's go ahead and do that calculation,so if we

75
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,141
plugged in 10^7, the pKa would be equal

76
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:01,645
to the negative log of 10^7

77
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:04,698
,which is equal to -7

78
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:08,482
so you could say that the pKa of HCl

79
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:12,650
is equal to -7,which is again the number is easier

80
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,482
to work with than 10^7

81
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,236
and so using the pKa way of doing

82
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:26,902
it,you are gonna get a range of pKa's approximately -10 to approximately 50,and so

83
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,645
of the compounds that you discuss,you are usually gonna be in this range

84
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:33,310
so once again it's just much easier to work with

85
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,528
now mathematically the higher this number is,right,so this number

86
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,111
right here 10^7 the lower the value

87
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:46,502
you're gonna get for your pKa,and so that allows

88
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:49,527
you to realize that mathematically the

89
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:54,112
stronger the acid is ,the lower the pKa value that you

90
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:58,107
are going to get,and so conversely the weaker the acid

91
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,108
, the higher the pKa value that you will get.So when you are trying

92
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:05,707
to compare two molecules in terms of acidity

93
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:09,970
if you look at their pKa values the molecules with the lower

94
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,639
pKa values is going to be the stronger acid,so let's go

95
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,306
ahead and do an example

96
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:18,633
you are gonna see how to apply this

97
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,437
skill.If we took the ethane molecule,so ethane

98
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:24,925
would be c2h6 ,so go ahead and put in

99
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:28,042
these hydrogens here like that

100
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:32,634
we were comparing ethane to ethanol,let's go ahead and draw

101
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:36,035
an ethanol now.So ethanol is a very similar molecule

102
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:40,003
the only difference is there is gonna be an oxygen and

103
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:44,175
there is going to be an hydrogen on that oxygen here.

104
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:47,773
Here are two dot structures and if you are thinking about the acidity

105
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:51,676
of these two molecules if you look at the molecule on the left for ethane

106
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:55,568
all these hydrogens are equivalent,so in terms of donating a proton I could

107
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:59,835
say that thid could be the proton that is donated.When you look at ethanol

108
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,773
all the hydrogens are not equivalent.

109
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,977
In the acid-base chemistry,this is going to be the acidic proton.

110
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:11,302
And the measured pKa values for this molecules,ethane turns out to have a

111
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:14,508
pKa of approximately 50 and ethanol

112
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:20,390
has a pKa value of approximately 16.

113
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,769
So thinking about the math,remember the lower the

114
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:26,236
pKa value,the stronger the acid ,and so

115
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:30,240
ethanol is a stronger acid

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,108
than ethane.In terms of how much more acidic is ethanol than ethane,it might be

117
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:42,158
tempting just using subtract those numbers.So 50

118
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:47,025
-16 gives you 34,so you might be tempted to say that ethanol 34

119
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:54,759
times acidic than ethane.It's 34 orders of magnitude more acidic than ethane

120
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,257
is.So in reality ethanol is ten

121
00:07:57,257 --> 00:08:01,554
to the 34th times more acidic,which

122
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:05,357
is an extremely large number,and so for all practical

123
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:08,155
purposes,ethanol is

124
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:15,392
acidic but ethane is not acidic at all.That gives you these relative values,so ethanol

125
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:20,222
is much more acidic than ethane,but ethanol is not

126
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:24,223
anywhere near as acidic as HCl is,so HCl is considered

127
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:28,157
to be a strong acid,ethanol is not considered to be a strong acid.

128
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:32,027
and ethane is not considered to be an acid at all.But remember these values are

129
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:35,299
all relative,but these pKa values are extremely

130
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,637
improtant and you'll see them come up several times in organic chemistry course.

131
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:43,021
The next video we will talk about the difference,uh,why

132
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:46,394
there's large difference in acidity between ethanol and

133
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,000
ethane.
