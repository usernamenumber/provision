1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,060
Let's say I go to the fruit store today and they

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,710
have a sale on guavas.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,720
Everything is thirty percent off.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,550
This is for guavas.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,350
And it's only today.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,740
Only today.

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,550
So I say, you know what, let me go buy a bunch of guavas.

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,850
So I go and I buy six guavas.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,370
So I buy six guavas.

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,350
And it ends up, when I go to the register, and we're

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,460
assuming no tax, it's a grocery and I live in a state where

12
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,890
they don't tax groceries.

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,670
So for the six guavas, they charge me, I get the thirty percent off.

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,490
They charge me $12.60.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,640
$12.60.

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,260
So this is the thirty percent off sale price on six guavas.

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,290
I go home, and then my wife tells me, you know, Sal, can

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,040
you go get two more guavas tomorrow?

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,700
I say, sure.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,770
So the next day I go and I want to buy two more guavas.

21
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,020
So, two guavas.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,750
But now the sale is off.

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,050
There's no more thirty percent.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,570
That was only that first day that I bought the six.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,630
So how much are those two guavas going to cost me?

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,650
How much are those two guavas going to cost at full price?

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,790
At full price?

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,520
So, a good place to start is, to think about how much

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,230
would those six guavas have cost us at full price?

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,600
This is the sale price, right here?

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,170
This is the sale price.

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,490
How much would those have cost me at full price?

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,340
So let's do a little bit of algebra here.

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,570
Pick a suitable color for the algebra.

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,780
Maybe this grey color.

36
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,160
So, let's say that x is equal to the cost of six guarvas.

37
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:53,620
six guavas, at full price.

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,080
So, essentially, if we take thirty percent off of this,

39
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,940
we should get $12.60.

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,040
So let's do that.

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,220
So if we have the full price of six guavas, we're going

42
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,180
to take thirty percent off of that.

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,280
So that's the same thing as 0.30.

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,680
Or I could just write 0.3.

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,740
I could ignore that zero if I like.

46
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,630
Actually, let me write it like this.

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,460
My wife is always bugging me to write zeroes before decimals.

48
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,650
So that's the full price of 6 guavas minus 0.30 times

49
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,950
the full price of guavas.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,340
Some I'm just taking thirty percent off of the full price,

51
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,510
off of the full price.

52
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,890
This is how we figure out the sale price.

53
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,470
This is going to be equal to that $12.60 right there.

54
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,530
That's going to be equal to $12.60.

55
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,890
I just took thirty percent off of the full price.

56
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,190
And now we just do algebra.

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,120
We could imagine there's a one in front -- you know, x

58
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,010
is the same thing as onex.

59
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,280
So 1x minus 0.3x is going to be equal to 0.7x.

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,230
So we get 0.7x, or we could say 0.70 if you like.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Same number.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,060
Point, or 0.7x, is equal to 12.60.

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,120
And once you get used to these problems, you might just skip

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,770
straight to this step right here.

65
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,660
Where you say, seventy percent of the full price is equal to

66
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,540
my sale price, right?

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,990
I took thirty percent off.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,150
This is seventy percent of the full price.

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,360
You might just skip to this step once you get used to these

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,260
problems in a little bit.

71
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,770
And now we just have to solve for x.

72
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,030
Divide both sides by 0.7, so you get x is equal to

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,360
12.60 divided by 0.7.

74
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,960
We could use a calculator, but it's always good to get a

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,050
little bit of practice dividing decimals.

76
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,860
So let's do that.

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,580
So we get 0.7 goes into 12.60.

78
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,870
Let's multiply both of these numbers by ten, which is what we

79
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,260
do when we move both of their decimals one to the right.

80
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,580
So the 0.7 becomes a 7.

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,030
Ignore that right there.

82
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,960
The 12.60 becomes 126, put the decimal right there.

83
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,330
Decimal right there.

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,680
And we're ready to just do straight up long division.

85
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,110
So this is now a seven, not a .seven.

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,210
So seven goes into twelve one time.

87
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,920
one times seven is seven.

88
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,620
twelve minus seven is five.

89
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,860
Bring down the six.

90
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,330
seven goes into fifty-six eight times.

91
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,370
eight times seven is fifty-six.

92
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,400
And then we have no remainder.

93
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,810
So it's eighteen, and there's nothing behind the decimal point.

94
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,870
So it;s eighteen, in our case, $eighteen.

95
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,790
So x is equal to $eighteen.

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,740
Remember what x was? x was the full price of six guavas.

97
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,920
x was the full price of six.

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,060
x is the full price of six guavas.

99
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,660
Now, the question is, how much will two guavas cost

100
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,220
me at the full price?

101
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:52,700
Well, this is full price of six.

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,320
So you immediately could figure out what's the

103
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,510
full price of one guava.

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,630
You divide eighteen by six.

105
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,750
So eighteen divided by six is $three.

106
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,460
That's $three per guava at full price.

107
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,860
And they're asking us, we want two guavas.

108
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,270
So two guavas is going to be two times $three, so this

109
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,730
is going to be $six.

110
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,550
$six.

111
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,050
Another way you could have done it, you could have just said,

112
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,990
hey, six at full price are going to cost me $eighteen.

113
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,630
two is one / three of six.

114
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,430
So one / three of $eighteen is $six.

115
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,110
So, just to give a quick review what we did.

116
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,740
We said the sale price on six guavas, $12.60.

117
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,350
That's thirty percent off the full price.

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,290
Or you could say this is seventy percent of the full price.

119
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,750
seventy percent of the full price.

120
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,500
And so you could say, thirty percent -- so if you say x is the full price

121
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,560
of six guavas, you could say the full price of six guavas minus

122
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,780
30% of the full price of 6 guavas is equal to 12.60, and

123
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,130
that's equivalent to saying, 70% of the full price is 12.60.

124
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,320
You divided -- then we just solved this algebraically.

125
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,140
Divide both sides by 0.7, and then we got x, the full price

126
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,810
of six guavas, is $eighteen, or that's $three per guava or $six for two.

127
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,360
Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.
