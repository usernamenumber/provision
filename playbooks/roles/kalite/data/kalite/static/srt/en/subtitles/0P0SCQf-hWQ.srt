1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Use elimination to solve for x and y,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they give us two equations here.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x + 2y is equal to 6

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
4x - 2y is equal to 14

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so to solve, to solve by elimination

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what we do is we are going to add these two equations together

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that one of the two variable essintially gets

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
eliminated, gets cancelled out.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what we can do right here

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see we have a +2y here we see we have a -2y

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here. So clearly if we added these two

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
together the y's would cancel out.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's exactly what were going to do.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were going to add the left side of this equation

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the left side of this equation,

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the right-hand side of that equation

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the right hand side of the bottom equation.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So to make it clear that this should make sense is

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were just using both of these constraints.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Whenever you learn about any type of equation
