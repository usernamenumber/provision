1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We already know that 2 to the 4th power can be view as starting with number 1 and then multiplying by 2, 4 times

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, let me do that. so, time 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. and that will give us...16

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now i will ask you a more interesting question. What do you think 2 to the negative 4th power will be?

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I encourage you to pause the video and think about that

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You may be tempted to say maybe is negative sixteen or something like that, but remember

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what the exponent operation is trying to do. This is one way of viewing this. This is telling us is how many time are we going to

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiply 2 times negative 1, but here we are going to multiply negative 4 times? What negative traditionally mean?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Negative traditionally means the opposite. So here is how many times you are going to multiply.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe when we make it negative this says how many time, are we going to starting with the 1, are we going to divide

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by 2, so let think about that a little bit. So this can be view as one times

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are going to divide by 2, 4 times. We are dividing by 2 is the same thing as multiplying by 1/2

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we can say that this 1 times 1/2 times... so 1 time 1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2 times 1/2

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
notice, multiplying by one half 4 time is the exactly the same thing as dividing by 2, 4 times

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in this situation, this will get you

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 time 1/2 is 1/2, time 1/2 is 1/4, times 1/2 is 1/8, times 1/2 is 1/16

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so you probably see the relationship here

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is essentially...you starting with the 1 and you divide by 2, 4 times

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you could also say...that 2 to the - 4 is the same thing as 1/(2^4)

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me color code nicely so you realize what is negative doing

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this negative right over here

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me do it in a better color...magenta, something that jumps out

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
