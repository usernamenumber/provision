1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,198
Let's look at how to prepare sulfides from thiols.

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:05,718
So, over here on the left I have my Thiol

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:09,785
And to that thiol I'm going to add sodium hydroxide.

4
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:12,827
And the sodium hydroxide is going to deprotonate the thiol

5
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:17,255
Which is then going to react with this alkyl halide in the second step of the reaction

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:20,754
to produce this sulfide as my product

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,754
Here is my sulfide right here.

8
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,089
This reaction is the analogue of the Williamson ether synthesis

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:27,831
which we've seen in an earlier video

10
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:31,466
So, in that video we started out with an alcohol

11
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:38,063
and we reacted our alcohol with as strong base in the first step and an alkyl halide in the second step.

12
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:41,464
And we formed an ether as our product.

13
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:44,575
We can go ahead and draw our ether in like that.

14
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:48,902
So, the thiol is the sulfur analogue to an alcohol

15
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:52,043
and a sulfide is the sulfur analogue to an ether.

16
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:55,564
Let's look at the mechanism to make sulfides...

17
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:59,315
So, if I start with my thiol right here.

18
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:03,049
I have carbon bonded to sulfur bonded to hydrogen

19
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:05,958
and two lone pairs of electrons on that sulfur.

20
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:10,456
And if I think about the difference in electro-negativity between carbon and sulfur

21
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:14,838
there's actually not much of a difference in terms of numbers.

22
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:18,085
So, this is not a very polar bond actually.

23
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:20,108
That's different with what we see from an alcohol.

24
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:24,614
So, up here if we look at the alcohol, I know that oxygen is a lot more electro-negative than carbon

25
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:27,194
This oxygen here would get a partial negative

26
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:30,311
and this carbon on the left (R-) would get a partial positive.

27
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:33,602
There is much more of an electro-negativity difference in alcohols.

28
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:37,325
In thiols there's not really that much of a difference

29
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:40,444
But thiols can still function as nucleophiles

30
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:47,001
Because these lone pairs of electrons are located further away from the nucleus than the lone pair on the oxygen

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,461
because sulfur is a larger atom.

32
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:55,556
Those electrons (on sulfur) are more polarizable, and so thiols are actually excellent nucleophiles.

33
00:01:55,556 --> 00:02:02,699
If we go back here to our mechanism, we are going to add sodium hydroxide which is a base.

34
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:05,981
So, we can go ahead and put OH- over here

35
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:08,656
The hydroxide anion is going to function as a base

36
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:15,343
and a lone pair of electrons are going to take this proton and leave these protons behind on the sulfur.

37
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,290
Let's go ahead and draw the conjugate base to the thiol.

38
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:25,695
We now have Carbon bonded to sulfur, and sulfur now has 3 lone pairs of electrons.

39
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,679
Giving it a negative one (-1) formal charge.

40
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:33,008
This is called a "Thiolate anion". Let me go ahead and write that.

41
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:37,704
A thiolate anion.

42
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:39,665
And thiolate anions are very stable.

43
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:44,679
That negative charge of the sulfur, since sulfur is a large atom

44
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,163
You can spread out that negative charge over a very large area.

45
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:55,007
So the thiolate anion is relatively stable and that makes thiols more acidic than alcohols.

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,568
Alcohols don't have the same type of stabilization, since alcohols are smaller.

47
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:04,275
So, thiols are actually very acidic and that's why we can use sodium hydroxide here

48
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,529
to deprotonate our thiol to form the thiolate anion.

49
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,990
In the second step we add our alkyl halide

50
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:13,089
Here's my alkyl halide.

51
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:16,497
And the alkyl halide does have a polarized bond.

52
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:21,604
The difference in electronegativity between a halogen and a carbon atom is fairly large.

53
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,967
This halogen is going to get a partial negative charge and this carbon is going to get a partial positive charge.

54
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:31,227
So, thiols are good nucleophiles.

55
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:34,145
Thiolate anions are even better nucleophiles.

56
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,567
So, the thiolate anion is going to function as a nucleophile.

57
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,914
The partially positive carbon is going to function as the electrophile

58
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:43,488
and we're going to get an SN2 type mechanism.

59
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,885
Where our strong nucleophile attacks our electrophile

60
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,862
and kicks these electrons off here, on to the halogen.

61
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,962
And we can go ahead here and form our product. Right?

62
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:58,444
This is an SN2 type mechanism.

63
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:04,427
And we end up with the sulfur now bonded to two R groups.

64
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:07,920
They could obviously be the same R groups or they could be different R groups.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,664
And so, we've formed our sulfide like that.

66
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:14,744
Let's do an example of the preparation of sulfides.

67
00:04:14,744 --> 00:04:19,398
We're going to start with this one right here.

68
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:30,706
We start with this molecule and to that thiol we're going to add sodium hydroxide in the first step.

69
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:35,055
Let's go ahead and write "sodium hydroxide"

70
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:39,721
Na+ Then OH- like that

71
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:44,788
And in the second step we're going to add an alkyl halide.

72
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:48,700
Let's add this as our alkyl halide: Ethyl Bromide.

73
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,059
When I think about the mechanism, I know the first step is an acid/base reaction.

74
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:59,436
The electrons on the hydroxide anion... so one of these electron pairs here...

75
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,337
Are going to take this proton, that's the acidic proton on my thiol.

76
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,513
Leaving these electrons behind on the sulfur

77
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,523
I can go ahead and draw the resulting thiolate anion.

78
00:05:10,523 --> 00:05:15,154
I can go ahead and draw that. Let me see what we have here.

79
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:20,754
We have our ring, and then we have our sulfur, and our sulfur now has three lone pairs of electrons around it

80
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,622
Like that.

81
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:27,075
Thiolate anions are excellent nucleophiles and when I look at my alkyl halide

82
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:32,233
once again I know the electronegativity difference between bromine and this carbon

83
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:37,050
is going to give bromine a partial negative charge and this carbon's going to be partially positive.

84
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,144
So, the thiolate anion is going to act as a nucleophile in an SN2 type mechanism

85
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:46,410
and a lone pair of electrons here are going to attack my electrophile

86
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,678
and we can go ahead and form our product.

87
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:54,630
Now we have our ring here, which is connected to our sulfur.

88
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,807
And our sulfur now just picked up two more carbons right?

89
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:02,092
Because these electrons here are going to kick off on to the bromine

90
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:05,135
and we end up putting an ethyl group on to that sulfur.

91
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:08,559
so there are two carbons, now, on the sulfur like that.

92
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:11,110
and the sulfur has two lone pairs of electrons

93
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,210
And so, we've formed our sulfide!

94
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,130
Now, if I were to name this sulfide, it is a lot like naming ethers.

95
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,082
I could use the common way of naming this and treat those as alkyl groups.

96
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:27,515
If I look on the right this would be an ethyl group

97
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,322
I could go ahead and start naming it.

98
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:35,516
I could say it's "ethyl". And if I look at the alkyl group on the left side, this is a phenyl group.

99
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:41,053
So it's ethyl and then phenyl since I'm following the alphabet rule.

100
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,935
E before P.

101
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,839
And then finally, I know it's a sulfide.

102
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,011
So I can just go ahead and finish the nomenclature here by saying, "sulfide" here.

103
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:55,011
So, "ethyl phenyl sulfide" is the sulfide produced in this analogue of the Williamson ether synthesis.
