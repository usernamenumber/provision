1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,950
Where I left off in the last
video, we talked about how the

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,440
hemoglobin in red blood cells
is what sops up all of the

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,440
oxygen so that it increases the
diffusion gradient-- or it

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,800
increases the incentive, we
could say, for the oxygen to

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,760
go across the membrane.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,390
We know that the oxygen
molecules don't know that

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,185
there's less oxygen here, but
if you watch the video on

9
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,170
diffusion you know how
that process happens.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,840
If there's less concentration
here than there, the oxygen

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,070
will diffuse across the membrane
and there's less

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,010
inside the plasma because the
hemoglobin is sucking it all

13
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,510
up like a sponge.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,060
Now, one interesting question
is, why does the hemoglobin

15
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,570
even have to reside within
the red blood cells?

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,680
Why aren't hemoglobin proteins
just freely floating in the

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,650
blood plasma?

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,060
That seems more efficient.

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,020
You don't have to have things
crossing through, in and out

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,220
of, these red blood
cell membranes.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,380
You wouldn't have to make
red blood cells.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,570
What's the use of having these
containers of hemoglobin?

23
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,920
It's actually a very
interesting idea.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,519
If you had all of the hemoglobin
sitting in your

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,960
blood plasma, it would
actually hurt

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,450
the flow of the blood.

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,500
The blood would become more
viscous or more thick.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,430
I don't want to say like syrup,
but it would become

29
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,520
thicker than blood is right
now-- and by packaging the

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,700
hemoglobin inside these
containers, inside the red

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,270
blood cells, what it allows
the blood to do

32
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,800
is flow a lot better.

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,610
Imagine if you wanted to
put syrup in water.

34
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,890
If you just put syrup
straight into water,

35
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,650
what's going to happen?

36
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,100
The water's going to become a
little syrupy, a little bit

37
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,510
more viscous and not
flow as well.

38
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,930
So what's the solution
if you wanted to

39
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,370
transport syrup in water?

40
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,940
Well, you could put the syrup
inside little containers or

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,140
inside little beads and then
let the beads flow in the

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,540
water and then the water
wouldn't be all gooey-- and

43
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,520
that's exactly what's happening
inside of our blood.

44
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,980
Instead of having the hemoglobin
sit in the plasma

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,440
and make it gooey, it sits
inside these beads that we

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,640
call red blood cells that allows
the flow to still be

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,420
non-viscous.

48
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,800
So I've been all zoomed in here
on the alveolus and these

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
capillaries, these pulmonary
capillaries-- let's zoom out a

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
little bit-- or zoom out a lot--
just to understand, how

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,130
is the blood flowing?

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,790
And get a better understanding
of pulmonary arteries and

53
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,920
veins relative to the other
arteries and veins

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,140
that are in the body.

55
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,740
So here-- I copied this from
Wikipedia, this diagram of the

56
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,810
human circulatory system--
and here in the back

57
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,310
you can see the lungs.

58
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,220
Let me do it in a
nice dark color.

59
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,880
So we have our lungs here.

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,600
   

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,890
You can see the heart is sitting
right in the middle.

62
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,110
And what we learned in the last
few videos is that we

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,260
have our little alveoli
and our lungs.

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,780
Remember, we get to them from
our bronchioles, which are

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,190
branching off of the bronchi,
which branch off of the

66
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,590
trachea, which connects to our
larynx, which connects to our

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,900
pharynx, which connects
to our mouth and nose.

68
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,350
But anyway, we have our little
alveoli right there and then

69
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,880
we have the capillaries.

70
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,450
So when we go away from the
heart-- and we're going to

71
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,910
delve a little bit into the
heart in this video as well--

72
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,140
so when blood travels away
from the heart, it's

73
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,130
de-oxygenated.

74
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,230
It's this blue color.

75
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,960
So this right here is blood.

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,050
This right here is blood
traveling away from the heart.

77
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,310
It's going behind these
two tubes right there.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,230
So this is the blood going
away from the heart.

79
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,250
So this blue that I've been
highlighting just now, these

80
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,620
are the pulmonary arteries and
then they keep splitting into

81
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
arterials and all of that
and eventually we're in

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,600
capillaries-- super,
super small tubes.

83
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,690
They run right past the alveoli
and then they become

84
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,270
oxygenated and now we're going
back to the heart.

85
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,730
So we're talking about
pulmonary veins.

86
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,080
So we go back to the heart.

87
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,590
So these capillaries-- in the
capillaries we get oxygen.

88
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,600
Now we're going to go
back to the heart.

89
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,090
Hope you can see
what I'm doing.

90
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,450
And we're going to enter
the heart on this side.

91
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,709
You actually can't even
see where we're

92
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,290
entering the heart.

93
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,050
We're going to enter the heart
right over here-- and I'm

94
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,709
going to go into more
detail on that.

95
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,040
Now we have oxygenated blood.

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,850
It's red.

97
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,650
And then that gets pumped out
to the rest of the body.

98
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,480
Now this is the interesting
thing.

99
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,060
When we're talking about
pulmonary arteries and veins--

100
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,170
remember, the pulmonary
artery was blue.

101
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,240
As we go away from the heart,
we have de-oxygenated blood,

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,610
but it's still an artery.

103
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,070
Then as we go towards the heart
from the lungs, we have

104
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,400
a vein, but it's oxygenated.

105
00:04:45,400 --> 00:05:12,160
   

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,990
So that's this little loop here
that we start and I'm

107
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,760
going to keep going over the
circulation pattern because

108
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,560
the heart can get a little
confusing, especially because

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,270
of its three-dimensional
nature.

110
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,010
But what we have is, the heart
pumps de-oxygenated blood from

111
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,090
the right ventricle.

112
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,500
You're saying, hey, why is
it the right ventricle?

113
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,600
That looks like the left side of
the drawing, but it's this

114
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,590
dude's right-hand side, right?

115
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,680
This is this guy's right hand.

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,100
And this is this dude's
left hand.

117
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,570
He's looking at us, right?

118
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,790
We don't care about
our right or left.

119
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,650
We care about this guy's
right and left.

120
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,530
And he's looking at us.

121
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,210
He's got some eyeballs and
he's looking at us.

122
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,790
So this is his right
ventricle.

123
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,060
Actually, let me just start
off with the whole cycle.

124
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,110
So we have de-oxygenated blood
coming from the rest of the

125
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,360
body, right?

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,060
   

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,220
The name for this big pipe is
called the inferior vena

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,310
cava-- inferior because
it's coming up below.

129
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,680
Actually, you have blood coming
up from the arms and

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
the head up here.

131
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,620
They're both meeting right here,
in the right atrium.

132
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,950
Let me label that.

133
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm going to do a big diagram
of the heart in a second.

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,110
   

135
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,610
And why are they
de-oxygenated?

136
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,100
Because this is blood returning
from our legs if

137
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,330
we're running, or returning from
our brain, that had to

138
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,450
use respiration-- or maybe we're
working out and it's

139
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,370
returning from our biceps, but
it's de-oxygenated blood.

140
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,400
It shows up right here
in the right atrium.

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
It's on our left, but this
guy's right-hand side.

142
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,400
From the right atrium,
it gets pumped

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,630
into the right ventricle.

144
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,860
It actually passively flows
into the right ventricle.

145
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,530
The ventricles do all the
pumping, then the ventricle

146
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:00,260
contracts and pumps this blood
right here-- and you don't see

147
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,980
it, but it's going behind
this part right here.

148
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,740
It goes from here through
this pipe.

149
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,580
So you don't see it.

150
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,970
I'm going to do a detailed
diagram in a second-- into the

151
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,400
pulmonary artery.

152
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,930
We're going away
from the heart.

153
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,790
This was a vein, right?

154
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,640
This is a vein going
to the heart.

155
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,130
This is a vein, inferior
vena cava vein.

156
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,560
This is superior vena cava.

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,990
These are veins.

158
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,140
They're de-oxygenated.

159
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,510
Then I'm pumping this
de-oxygenated blood away from

160
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,340
the heart to the lungs.

161
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,620
Now this de-oxygenated blood,
this is in an artery, right?

162
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,670
This is in the pulmonary
artery.

163
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,230
It gets oxygenated and now
it's a pulmonary vein.

164
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,570
And once it's oxygenated, it
shows up here in the left--

165
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,060
let me do a better color than
that-- it shows up right here

166
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,590
in the left atrium.

167
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,830
Atrium, you can imagine-- it's
kind of a room with a skylight

168
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,650
or that's open to the outside
and in both of these cases,

169
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,900
things are entering from above--
not sunlight, but

170
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,320
blood is entering from above.

171
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,320
On the right atrium, the blood
is entering from above.

172
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,110
And in the left atrium, the
blood is entering-- and

173
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,950
remember, the left atrium is
on the right-hand side from

174
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,580
our point of view-- on the
left atrium, the blood is

175
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,320
entering from above from
the lungs, from

176
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,120
the pulmonary veins.

177
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,110
Veins go to the heart.

178
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,500
Then it goes into-- and I'll go
into more detail-- into the

179
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,810
left ventricle and then the
left ventricle pumps that

180
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,020
oxygenated blood to the rest
of the body via the

181
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,610
non-pulmonary arteries.

182
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,539
So everything pumps out.

183
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,520
Let me make it a nice dark,
non-blue color.

184
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,179
So it pumps it out
through there.

185
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,169
You don't see it right here,
the way it's drawn.

186
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,060
It's a little bit of
a strange drawing.

187
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,610
It's hard to visualize, but I'll
show it in more detail

188
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,420
and then it goes to the
rest of the body.

189
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,130
Let me show you that
detail right now.

190
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,670
   

191
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,750
So we said, we have
de-oxygenated blood.

192
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,350
Let's label it right here.

193
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,590
This is the superior
vena cava.

194
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,960
This is a vein from the upper
part of our body from

195
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,980
our arms and heads.

196
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,540
This is the inferior
vena vaca.

197
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,910
This is veins from our abdomen
and from our legs and the rest

198
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,810
of our body.

199
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,560
So it it first enters
the right atrium.

200
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,460
Remember, we call the right
atrium because this is

201
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,650
someone's heart facing us, even
though this is on the

202
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,710
left-hand side.

203
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,880
It enters through here.

204
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,790
It's de-oxygenated blood.

205
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,240
It's coming from veins.

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,260
the body used the oxygen.

207
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,100
Then it shows up in the right
ventricle, right?

208
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,670
These are valves in our heart.

209
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,440
And it passively, once the right
ventricle pumps and then

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,350
releases, it has a vacuum and
it pulls more blood from the

211
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:40,770
right atrium.

212
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,550
It pumps again and then it
pushes it through here.

213
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,110
Now this blood right here--
remember, this one still is

214
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,140
de-oxygenated blood.

215
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,910
De-oxygenated blood goes
to the lungs to become

216
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,190
oxygenated.

217
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,350
So this right here is the
pulmonary-- I'm using the word

218
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,370
pulmonary because it's going
to or from the lungs.

219
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,970
It's dealing with the lungs.

220
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,850
And it's going away
from the heart.

221
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:13,590
It's the pulmonary artery
and it is de-oxygenated.

222
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,750
   

223
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:25,190
Then it goes to the heart, rubs
up against some alveoli

224
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:31,060
and then gets oxygenated and
then it comes right back.

225
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,990
Now this right here, we're
going to the heart.

226
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,240
So that's a vein.

227
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,380
   

228
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,650
It's in the loop with the lungs
so it's a pulmonary vein

229
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,000
and it rubbed up against the
alveoli and got the oxygen

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,625
diffused into it so
it is oxygenated.

231
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,930
   

232
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,740
And then it flows into
your left atrium.

233
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,520
Now, the left atrium, once
again, from our point of view,

234
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,530
is on the right-hand side, but
from the dude looking at it,

235
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,230
it's his left-hand side.

236
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,050
So it goes into the
left atrium.

237
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,650
Now in the left ventricle, after
it's done pumping, it

238
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,110
expands and that oxygenated
blood flows

239
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,380
into the left ventricle.

240
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,880
Then the left ventricle-- the
ventricles are what do all the

241
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,870
pumping-- it squeezes and
then it pumps the

242
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,650
blood into the aorta.

243
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,180
   

244
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,125
This is an artery.

245
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,270
   

246
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,200
Why is it an artery?

247
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,390
Because we're going away
from the heart.

248
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,950
Is it a pulmonary artery?

249
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,370
No, we're not dealing with
the lungs anymore.

250
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,020
We dealt with the lungs when
we went from the right

251
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,920
ventricle, went to the
lungs in a loop,

252
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,560
back to the left atrium.

253
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,770
Now we're in the
left ventricle.

254
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,900
We pump into the aorta.

255
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,550
Now this is to go to the
rest of the body.

256
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,020
This is an artery, a
non-pulmonary artery-- and it

257
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,270
is oxygenated.

258
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,940
   

259
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,490
So when we're dealing with
non-pulmonary arteries, we're

260
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,040
oxygenated, but a pulmonary
artery has no oxygen.

261
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,500
It's going away from the heart
to get the oxygen.

262
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,250
Pulmonary vein comes from the
lungs to the heart with

263
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,950
oxygen, but the rest of the
veins go to the heart without

264
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,740
oxygen because they want to
go into that loop on the

265
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,880
pulmonary loop right there.

266
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,700
So I'll leave you there.

267
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,480
Hopefully that gives-- actually,
let's go back to

268
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,200
that first diagram.

269
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,780
I think you have a sense of how
the heart is dealing, but

270
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,750
let's go look at the rest
of the body and just

271
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,340
get a sense of things.

272
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,170
You can look this up on
Wikipedia if you like.

273
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,220
All of these different
branching points have

274
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,200
different names to them, but
you can see right here you

275
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,450
have kind of a branching off, a
little bit below the heart.

276
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,080
This is actually the
celiac trunk.

277
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,370
   

278
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,040
Celiac, if I remember correctly,
kind of refers to

279
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,080
an abdomen.

280
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,510
So this blood that-- your
hepatic artery.

281
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,940
Hepatic deals with the liver.

282
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,800
Your hepatic artery branches off
of this to get blood flow

283
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,970
to the liver.

284
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,120
It also gives blood flow to
your stomach so it's very

285
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,780
important in digestion
and all that.

286
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,240
And then let's say this
is the hepatic trunk.

287
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,010
Your liver is sitting
like that.

288
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,070
Hepatic trunk-- it delivers
oxygen to the liver.

289
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,120
The liver is doing
respiration.

290
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,910
It takes up the oxygen
and then it

291
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,550
gives up carbon dioxide.

292
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,790
So it becomes de-oxygenated and
then it flows back in and

293
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,710
to the inferior vena cava,
into the vein.

294
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,200
I want to make it clear--
it's a loop.

295
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,480
It's a big loop.

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,620
The blood doesn't just flow out
someplace and then come

297
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,290
back someplace else.

298
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,200
This is just one big loop.

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,420
And if you want to know at any
given point in time, depending

300
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,010
on your size, there's about
five liters of blood.

301
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,240
And I looked it up-- it takes
the average red blood cell to

302
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,390
go from one point in the
circulatory system and go

303
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,630
through the whole system and
come back, 20 seconds.

304
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,330
That's an average because you
can imagine there might be

305
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,480
some red blood cells that get
stuck someplace and take a

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,930
little bit more time and some
go through the completely

307
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,900
perfect route.

308
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,790
Actually, the 20 seconds
might be closer

309
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,740
to the perfect route.

310
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,190
I've never timed it myself.

311
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,230
But it's an interesting thing to
look at and to think about

312
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,690
what's connected to what.

313
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,150
You have these these arteries up
here that they first branch

314
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,170
off the arteries up here from
the aorta into the head and

315
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,650
the neck and the arm arteries
and then later they go down

316
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,560
and they flow blood to
the rest of the body.

317
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,950
So anyway, this is a pretty
interesting idea.

318
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,250
In the next video, what I want
to do is talk about, how does

319
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,110
the hemoglobin know when
to dump the oxygen?

320
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,310
Or even better, where to dump
the oxygen-- because maybe I'm

321
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,830
running so I need a lot of
oxygen in the capillaries

322
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,340
around my thigh muscles.

323
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,410
I don't need them necessarily
in my hands.

324
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,700
How does the body optimize where
the oxygen is actually

325
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:53,915
delivering?

326
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,670
It's actually fascinating.

327
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,028
