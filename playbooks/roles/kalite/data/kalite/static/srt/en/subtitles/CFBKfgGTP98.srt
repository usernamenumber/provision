1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,340
In the last video, we tried
to draw a 2-Propylheptane.

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:09,900
   

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,350
And we did our best attempt at
drawing it, but it was pointed

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,420
out that this wouldn't even be
called a 2-Propylheptane to

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:16,900
begin with.

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,140
So you actually should never
see something called

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,500
2-Propylheptane.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,130
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,930
So when do you see something
like this, you might

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,310
immediately say-- and the way
we drew it was actually

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,570
correct, it just wouldn't be
called 2-Propylheptane.

13
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,950
So you say heptane.

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,600
So that is a seven
carbon alkane.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,050
No double bond, so one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,490
And then on the second carbon,
so you have one, two, three,

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:50,420
four, five, six, seven, we
have a propyl group.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,140
Propyl, that is three carbons.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,400
So on the second carbon we
have a propyl group.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,700
That's three carbons.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,090
So that is one, two, three.

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,100
And so the way we drew it
was just like this.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,950
And so if someone gave you
2-Propylheptane, this would be

24
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,010
what you would draw.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,380
But you wouldn't call this
2-Propylheptane.

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,750
Because remember, if you're
given the molecule you look

27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,020
for the longest chain and the
longest chain here is not the

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,730
heptane chain.

29
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,880
It is not one, two, three, it is
not this thing in magenta--

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,930
in this kind of mauve color.

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,550
It's this chain where
you start over here.

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,870
If you start over here, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,490
seven, eight, nine, you actually
get a longer chain.

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,870
So this would actually be the
backbone of this molecule

35
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,850
right over there.

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,860
That right over there would be
the backbone, and so you

37
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,830
would number it.

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,590
You start numbering closest to
the group that's attached, so

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,460
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

40
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,500
So you have nine carbons in
your backbone, so we're

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,560
dealing with nonane.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,450
We're dealing with nonane.

43
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,410
And you have a methyl group:
one carbon attached to the

44
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,880
fourth carbon of our
main backbone.

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,780
So this is going to be four
methyl, this is our methyl

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,340
group right here,
4-Methylnonane.

47
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,710
   

48
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,030
So it was brought up, I think
the user name is Minoctu, and

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,200
they correctly corrected me,
that there would never be such

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,490
a thing as 2-Propylheptane.

51
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,560
I just made that up.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,010
If someone were to, kind of,
label this molecule they would

53
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,665
call it 4-Methylnonane
and ask you draw it.

54
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:38,815
But either way, both of
these would point you

55
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:40,390
in the right direction.

56
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,140
This would just be the incorrect
name for it, because

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,370
you'd be looking at-- if someone
gave you this molecule

58
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,590
and you named it this way,
that would be incorrect.

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,750
So I apologize for this.

60
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,360
This is 4-Methylnonane.

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,850
If you do heptane you're not
finding the longest chain.

62
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,133
