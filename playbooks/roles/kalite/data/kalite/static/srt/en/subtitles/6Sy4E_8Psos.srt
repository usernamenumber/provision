1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,070
Problem 28.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,010
Which equation best represents the part of

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,400
the graph shown below?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,770
So we have a bunch of equations here. Let's see.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,910
This one is just a linear equation,

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,080
so this is just some number times x.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,020
So that graph in general would be a straight line.

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,830
This one and this one are straight lines.

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,060
This one would be a straight line with a positive slope,

10
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,120
maybe look something like that.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,370
This choice C right here would be a straight line

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,610
with a negative slope, like that.

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,610
They would both go through the origin,

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,380
because they don't have any y-intercept right there.

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,020
So neither of these are the answer.

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,450
So let's look at these two--

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,050
I guess we could call them quadratics.

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,080
So here we have 1.75x squared.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,880
So the graph of x squared-- let me do it in a better color--

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,650
the graph of x squared looks like this.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a parabola.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,030
You've seen that before.

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,750
And they're drawing it in the first quadrant right there,

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,980
and that looks about right.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,250
And you're like, hey, but what about the 1.75?

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,920
Well, that's just a scaling factor.

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
If you throw a larger number there,

28
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,440
it'll curve up a little bit faster.

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,990
If you throw a smaller number there,

30
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,020
it'll curve up a little bit slower.

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,620
But the general idea is that

32
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,020
they all have the general shape of a parabola.

33
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,530
So this one looks pretty good.

34
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,990
It's an upward opening parabola.

35
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,040
It's kind of an upright U.

36
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,310
So this looks like a pretty good solution.

37
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,940
If we were to draw the whole graph,

38
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,070
it would continue on this side like that.

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,410
Then choice D, it's just like choice B,

40
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,060
except they have a minus here.

41
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,740
And the reason why I know that's not going to work is

42
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,430
that the graph of minus x squared,

43
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,090
or minus anything times x squared is going to look like this

44
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,370
It's going to be downward opening.

45
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,550
So this is the graph of minus x squared,

46
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,820
the graph of minus 1.75x squared,

47
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,000
might open up or go down a little bit faster.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,890
So it's going to have the same general shape.

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,020
So we know that this is also not the right answer.

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,010
So our choice is B.

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,080
Next question.

52
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,010
29.

53
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,870
Lisa typed a 1,000-word essay at the average rate of

54
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,940
20 words per minute.

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,670
If she started typing at 6:20 PM and did not take any breaks

56
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,050
at what time did Lisa finish typing the essay?

57
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,510
So she had a 1,000-word essay

58
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,670
and she was typing at 20 words per minute.

59
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,000
So let me write that down.

60
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,190
So she had 1,000 words

61
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,000
and she's typing at 20 words per minute.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,350
So if you're writing 1,000 words

63
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,500
and you're doing 20 per minute,

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
how many minutes is it going to take?

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,030
Well, what's 1,000 divided by 20?

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,300
You could do this in your head.

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,530
You say 100 divided by 20 is 5.

68
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,040
1,000 is 10 hundreds.

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,000
So it's going to be 50.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,190
But if you don't want to do it in your head,

71
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,930
you can just say 20 goes into 1,000--

72
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,090
20 goes into 10 zero times.

73
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,010
20 goes into 100 five times.

74
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,570
5 times 20 is 100, and then you bring down the 0.

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,870
20 goes into 0 zero times, and then 0 times 20 is 0,

76
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,020
and then you are done.

77
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,580
20 goes into 1,000 fifty times.

78
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,650
Or you could say 2 goes into 100 five times.

79
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,650
All the same thing.

80
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,050
Just 20-- and then-- sorry, 50.

81
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,070
Want to be careful.

82
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,410
So it'll take her 50 minutes,

83
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,580
and actually the units work out.

84
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,550
You have words divided by words per minute,

85
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:39,470
or that's the same thing as words times minutes per word.

86
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,980
They cancel out, and you end up with 50 minutes.

87
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,710
If that confuses you, don't worry about it too much.

88
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,510
The intuition is what's important.

89
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,810
You had a 1,000-word essay, you did 20 words per minute.

90
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,040
So it was going to take you 50 minutes.

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,030
50 minutes times 20 words per minute is equal to 1,000 words

92
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,080
So you're going to have 50 minutes.

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,050
So she starts at 6:20 PM.

94
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:12,090
So at 7:00 PM, she's worked for 40 minutes.

95
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,020
Because there's 60 minutes in an hour.

96
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,380
But she works for 50 minutes,

97
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,080
so she does another 10 minutes.

98
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,000
So that gets her to 7:10.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,080
So the choice is D.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Problem 30.

101
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,050
What does-- let me do it in red.

102
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,000
What does x to the fifth equal when x is equal to minus 2?

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,540
So it's minus 2 times minus 2 times

104
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,040
minus 2 times minus 2 times minus 2.

105
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,010
Now we can just multiply it all out.

106
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,790
Let's just do that, just for fun.

107
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,050
Minus 2 times minus 2 is positive 4.

108
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,070
Then positive 4 times minus 2 is minus 8.

109
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,090
Minus 8 times minus 2 is positive 16.

110
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,520
Positive 16 times minus 2 is minus 32.

111
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,050
So our answer is A.

112
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,290
Now, if you wanted to do that really fast,

113
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,030
you might recognize, well, 2 to the fifth is 32.

114
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,010
So it's either going to be that choice or that choice.

115
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,050
And then we have a odd exponent.

116
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,580
So we're going to be multiplying a negative times

117
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,590
itself an even time, and then one more negative.

118
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,800
So you're going to get a negative number.

119
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,130
When you have an odd exponent,

120
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,440
you're going to end up with a negative.

121
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,010
You have an even exponent, you'll end up with a positive.

122
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,660
So that would have been the fast way to do it,

123
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,090
but even if you didn't do that,

124
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,220
you could have just multiplied it straight out

125
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,240
like we just did.

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
And just remember a negative times a negative is a positive,

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
and then a positive times the negative is a negative.

128
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,270
It's minus 32.

129
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,030
31.

130
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,020
The graph below compares the weight of an object on Earth

131
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,030
to its weight on the Moon.

132
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,020
Interesting.

133
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,880
An object's weight on the Moon, OK,

134
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,010
so this is the Moon weight, this is the Earth weight.

135
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,590
So something that-- let's say--

136
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,000
well, I actually do weigh 150 pounds.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,060
So I weigh 150 pounds on Earth, and according to this chart,

138
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,000
I would weigh 25 pounds on the Moon.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,010
Or I would weigh essentially 1/6 my weight

140
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,080
that I am on Earth.

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,010
What is it asking me?

142
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,540
What is the approximate weight on the Moon of an astronaut

143
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,040
who weighs 120 pounds on Earth?

144
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,060
Well, I just said,essentially this thing is just taking 1/6.

145
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,620
You can look at any point.

146
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,870
When you weigh 10 pounds on the Moon,

147
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:33,010
you're weighing roughly 60 pounds on Earth, or vice versa.

148
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,330
So you just take 1/6,

149
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,440
or we could actually just look at the chart.

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,030
120 pounds-- so if we go halfway, that's about 125,

151
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,440
between 100 and 150.

152
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,050
120 pounds would be right there.

153
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,080
You go up the graph, just like that.

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,560
And you go there, and it looks like 18 or 19 pounds.

155
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,250
And they say, what is the approximate weight?

156
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,100
So the closest thing we are here,

157
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,020
let's see, the choice of 15 and 20.

158
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,690
We're definitely closer to 20 than we are to 15.

159
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:04,620
So I will go with 20 right here.

160
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,770
And you know, if we really wanted to look at it,

161
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,510
this is actually the point that we should have looked at,

162
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,010
this point right here would have been 120 pounds.

163
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,130
But you just approximate where 120 is,

164
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,510
you read the graph, you say, oh,

165
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,990
it's closer to 20 than any of these other choices.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,060
So that'll be our answer.
