1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:05,623
The fair value of a futures contract is the price of the contract

2
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:10,523
at which a buyer of the stock would be neutral between

3
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:14,814
buying it on an actual stock exchange, and actually buying the stock.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:18,762
And agreeing to buy the futures contract, or the seller of the stock

5
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:22,523
would be neutral between selling it right now in the actual exchange

6
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:27,446
versus agreeing to go short. Or agreeing to be on the selling side for a futures contract.

7
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:31,133
And the fair value tends to be quoted for the front month.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:38,933
Or the next expiring future's contract. And to see how this works,

9
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:44,933
why someone would be neutral between, say, buying something now for a hundred dollars

10
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:49,180
and, agreeing to buying it, maybe, next month at a hundred and two dollars,

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,867
think of it this way: If they want to just hold that stock a month or two or three from now.

12
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:59,400
they could pay a hundred dollars right now, or they could take their hundred dollars,

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,412
so they could either just buy right now, or they could stick it maybe in a money market account.

14
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:10,264
They could get some interest for the next few weeks, and then they could buy the futures contract.

15
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:16,533
So they got interest of two dollars if they kept that hundred dollars in let's say,

16
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:21,600
a money market account for the next, until the actual contract date for that future's contract,

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,474
they'd be neutral. I could spend a hundred dollars today,

18
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,518
or I could put a hundred dollars in a money market account

19
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:30,867
and get two dollars in interest, and I'm not going to worry about the dividends right now,

20
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:34,200
if the dividends happened then, obviously, you would want to pay less for this thing

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,133
where didn't get the dividend. But assuming no dividends, you'd say,

22
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,614
"Well, I'd be willing to pay a hundred and two dollars for that."

23
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:43,840
If this was only a hundred and one dollars, if the price of the futures contract was

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,760
a hundred and one dollars, then you'd say,

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,267
"Wait, if the price of the future's contract was a hundred and one dollars,

26
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:53,778
I would rather put my money in a money market account and get two dollars of interest and buy it in a

27
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:58,200
month for a hundred and one dollars. I'll essentially get an extra dollar if I do that."

28
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,248
If the price is at a hundred and three dollars, you'd say,

29
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:10,267
"Well gee, if I want to hold that stock a month or two from now, I'm way better buying it right now."

30
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:14,467
Or, another way to think about it if the price is at a hundred and three dollars,

31
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,927
and I'm a seller of the stock. Instead of selling it today for a hundred dollars,

32
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm better off, let's say I need a hundred dollars right now,

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,200
I'm better off borrowing a hundred dollars right now, paying maybe two dollars in interest,

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,444
and then selling it a month later for a hundred and three dollars.

35
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:34,133
So the fair value is the price at which a buyer or seller is neutral between

36
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,533
buying and selling the stock or entering into a future's contract.

37
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:42,133
I'll go into it a little more into detail in the next video, but its main use is an

38
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,867
indicator of what is likely to happen once a market opens.

39
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:52,467
And that is because futures markets trade have much longer trading hours, sometimes twenty four hours, than

40
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:56,936
traditional stock markets. So if you can imagine,

41
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,583
If the price of a futures contract is trading below its fair value,

42
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,333
the only reason why that would happen is if a lot of

43
00:03:02,333 --> 99:59:59,000
people are actually expecting once the stock, the stock market opens, that the stock price is going to go down.
