1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,175
Let's do some data sufficiency
problems.

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:03,349
So the first problem, problem
number one on page 278.

3
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:04,415
It says, how much is 20%
of a certain number?

4
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,697
So we want to know
20% of a number.

5
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:08,480
Let me just call that x.

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,224
So what is that?

7
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:10,415
So the first data point they
give us is that 10% of the

8
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:11,381
number is 5.

9
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:12,959
So we could say that 10%
times x is equal to 5.

10
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:14,023
Or another way we can just
write that is 0.1

11
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:14,842
x is equal to 5.

12
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:15,679
And then the second data point,
I guess you could call

13
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,578
it, is 40% of twice the
number is equal to 40.

14
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:17,259
So 40%, 0.4 times twice the
number, so times 2x, right?

15
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:18,194
We chose x as our number--
is equal to 40.

16
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:18,975
So what we have to figure out
is do either of these data

17
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:19,620
points allow us to
figure out x?

18
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,442
Or maybe we need both of them.

19
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:21,213
Or maybe we can't figure it
out even with all of this

20
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:21,973
information.

21
00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:22,976
Well, this is a simple
linear equation.

22
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:23,834
A very easy way to think about
it is you could multiply both

23
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:24,780
sides of this by 2, both
sides of the equation.

24
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,745
And you end up with 0.2 times
x is equal to 10.

25
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,560
Well, that's the same thing
is saying that 20% of

26
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,294
x is equal to 10.

27
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:28,130
So statement one alone is all
we need to figure out this.

28
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,964
Let's see what statement
two gets us.

29
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:29,915
So if we simplify this
expression just a little bit,

30
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:30,923
we get 0.4 times 2.

31
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:31,945
We have 0.8 times x
is equal to 40.

32
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:32,892
And here, instead of multiplying
both sides of this

33
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:33,843
equation by 2, we could divide
both sides by 4, right?

34
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:34,712
Because we want to
get 20% of x.

35
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:35,559
This is 80% of x.

36
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:36,573
So if we divide both sides of
this by 4, we get what?

37
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:37,463
We got 0.2 x is equal to 10.

38
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,441
There you go.

39
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,478
20% of x is equal to 10.

40
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:40,546
So either of these alone are
enough to solve that problem.

41
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:41,733
And I always forget what the
letters are, but I think that

42
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:42,866
is statement d.

43
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:43,581
Each statement alone
is sufficient.

44
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,316
All right.

45
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:44,946
Problem number two.

46
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:45,596
I don't want to waste too
much time on that.

47
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:46,215
And I'm trying to do this in
real time without looking at

48
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:46,841
the answers, because I really
want you to get a sense of how

49
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:47,480
someone thinks about this
if they've never

50
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,176
seen the problem before.

51
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:48,725
And so I'll ask you to bear with
me a little bit because

52
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:49,318
maybe I'll get a
problem wrong.

53
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,015
And maybe that'll be instructive
if I do.

54
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:50,591
OK, They say a thoroughly
blended biscuit mix includes

55
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:51,129
only flour and baking powder.

56
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:52,624
What is the ratio of the number
of grams of baking

57
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:53,196
powder to the number
of grams of flour?

58
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:53,831
So we want to know the ratio
of baking powder to flour.

59
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,465
That's what we need
to figure out.

60
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:55,146
Now statement number one, they
tell us exactly 9.9 grams of

61
00:00:55,146 --> 00:00:55,912
flour is contained in 10
grams of this mix.

62
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:56,674
soon.

63
00:00:56,674 --> 00:00:57,426
So if there are 9.9 of flour,
and there's exactly 10, how

64
00:00:57,426 --> 00:00:58,215
much baking powder is there?

65
00:00:58,215 --> 00:00:58,809
Well, baking powder is going
to be equal to 10 minus the

66
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,523
amount of flour.

67
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:00,294
So it's going to be what?

68
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:00,944
0.1 grams. 9.9, we could say
that that is equal to flour.

69
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:01,715
So we could easily, just using
this statement, figure out the

70
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:02,348
ratio, right?

71
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:02,931
The ratio of baking powder to
flour is 0.1, because we just

72
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,564
took 10 minus the amount
of flour, to 9.9.

73
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,202
Or you could say, it's 1:99,
whatever, however you need it.

74
00:01:04,202 --> 00:01:04,929
But that's what's fun about
these problems. You don't have

75
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:05,847
to figure it out.

76
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:06,794
We just have to say we
could figure it out.

77
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:07,445
So one is enough by itself.

78
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:07,995
Let's see what statement
two tells us.

79
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,059
I'll do it in a slightly
different color.

80
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:10,296
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

81
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:10,862
Statement two says,
exactly 0.3 gram.

82
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,429
I think that's an error
in the book.

83
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:12,031
It should be grams. Exactly 0.3
gram of baking powder is

84
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:12,625
contained in 30 grams
of the mix.

85
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,229
So if we have 0.3 baking powder,
that's grams, and it

86
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:13,879
tells us there's 30
grams of the mix.

87
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,472
So how much flour do we have?

88
00:01:14,472 --> 00:01:15,058
What's 30 minus 0.3
is equal to what?

89
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:15,699
It's equal to 29.7 flour.

90
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:16,333
And so, once again, we can
easily figure out the ratio of

91
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:16,943
baking powder to flour is
0.3:29.7, which is, once

92
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:17,482
again, 1:99.

93
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:18,263
But we didn't have to
figure that out.

94
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:18,828
We just know that
this is enough.

95
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,609
So once again, we know that
d, each statement alone is

96
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:20,193
sufficient, unless I
missed something.

97
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:20,812
All right.

98
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:21,447
Problem number three.

99
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:22,814
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

100
00:01:22,814 --> 00:01:23,564
What is the value of the
absolute value of x?

101
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:24,364
So they want to know the
absolute value of

102
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:25,131
x is equal to what?

103
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:25,781
And the first statement, they
tell us is that x is equal to

104
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,417
the minus absolute value of x.

105
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:27,083
So what numbers is this true
for, that the number is equal

106
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:27,732
to the minus absolute value?

107
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:28,387
It's definitely not true for
positive numbers, right?

108
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:28,997
Put a positive 1 there.

109
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:29,730
1 is not equal to-- the absolute
value of 1 is 1, so 1

110
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,361
is not equal to negative 1.

111
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,081
This works for 0, right?

112
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,697
0 is equal to negative
0 is equal to 0.

113
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:32,347
And this works for
negative numbers.

114
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:32,941
Try it out.

115
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,676
Negative 1 is equal to the
negative absolute value of

116
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,382
negative 1.

117
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:35,098
Well, the absolute value of
negative 1 is 1, so you get

118
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:35,940
negative 1 is equal
to negative 1.

119
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,564
So it works for 0 and
negative numbers.

120
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,298
So all this tells us-- and maybe
this will help us in

121
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:37,929
conjunction with the second
part, who knows?

122
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:38,644
This tells us that x is less
than or equal to 0.

123
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:39,265
It's just a convoluted
way of saying this.

124
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,025
Let's see where that gets us.

125
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:40,696
Now the second statement.

126
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,097
Let's see, they say that x
squared is equal to 4.

127
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:43,527
Well, this tells us that x is
equal to plus or minus 2.

128
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:44,326
Now, if we were trying to figure
out what x is equal to,

129
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,041
we would actually need both of
these statements because this

130
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,771
statement says that x is
positive you 2 or negative 2.

131
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,470
And then this statement
says that, oh, x

132
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,427
is definitely negative.

133
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,212
So if we were trying to figure
out what the value of x was,

134
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:49,107
we would need both of
these statements.

135
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:49,898
But notice, they're asking us
what's the value of the

136
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:50,632
absolute value of x, right?

137
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,448
So regardless of whether x is
positive or negative 2, the

138
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:52,108
absolute value of either
positive or negative 2 is

139
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:52,794
always going to be equal to 2.

140
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:53,510
So really, this is
all you need.

141
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,065
You only need statement two to
figure out this problem.

142
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:54,912
And so that is b.

143
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:55,760
You only need statement two.

144
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,422
All right.

145
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:57,148
I think I got that one right.

146
00:01:57,148 --> 00:01:57,828
Let's see.

147
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:58,645
Problem number four.

148
00:01:58,645 --> 00:01:59,396
I'll do it in this
brownish color.

149
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,046
Problem number four.

150
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:00,762
Is r greater than 0.27?

151
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:01,497
Very simple question.

152
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,249
Is r greater than
0.27, they ask?

153
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:02,879
OK, statement one tells us that
r is greater than 1/4.

154
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,723
OK, well, that doesn't really--
r could still be--

155
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,624
this is 0.25, so r could still
be equal to 0.251, right?

156
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,524
It could be 0.251, or
it could be 0.3.

157
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,277
So this really doesn't give
us any information.

158
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,094
We don't know whether r
is greater than 0.27.

159
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:07,745
Let's see what the second
statement tells us.

160
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:08,440
The second statement says
r is equal to 3/10.

161
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,362
Well, that is equal to 0.3,
and that's definitely

162
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,113
greater than 0.27.

163
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:10,782
So this is all we need.

164
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:11,414
We just need statement two.

165
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:12,044
Statement one was a
little useless.

166
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:12,673
So that is-- I always forget
what letters-- that's b.

167
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:13,216
We only need statement two.

168
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:13,722
All right.

169
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,225
How am I doing on time?

170
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:14,767
Oh, I have time.

171
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,446
I think I can do a couple more
problems. These go fast,

172
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:17,077
because you don't have to
actually do the math.

173
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:17,828
Problem number five.

174
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:18,476
What is the value of the sum of
a list of n odd integers?

175
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,096
OK., and they didn't say
consecutive, and they didn't

176
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:20,789
say where it starts.

177
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:21,394
It's just n odd integers.

178
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:22,044
Fair enough.

179
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:22,629
OK, one, they tell us
n is equal to 8.

180
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,447
So if I knew that I was going to
sum eight odd integers, can

181
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:24,060
I know the sum?

182
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,680
Well, no.

183
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,314
I mean, it could be-- all of
these could be numbers in the

184
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:25,925
millions, or they could be
negative, or they could be

185
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:26,491
really small numbers.

186
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,114
So that doesn't help me much.

187
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:27,709
Point number two, they say the
square of the integers on the

188
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:28,248
list is 64.

189
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:28,815
So they're essentially saying
that n squared is equal to 64.

190
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,381
And since we're talking about
numbers in a list, it can't be

191
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:29,981
negative, so n is equal to 8.

192
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:30,595
So these are really telling me
the same thing, just this is a

193
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,346
little bit more convoluted.

194
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:31,896
But really, they
don't help out.

195
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:32,611
I could have eight numbers in
the billions, or I could have

196
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,139
eight numbers in the hundreds,
and so obviously, you're going

197
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:33,660
to get a different sum.

198
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,225
I don't think I can figure
this out anyway.

199
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:34,814
So that's what?

200
00:02:34,814 --> 00:02:35,442
That is statement e, that
together they're not

201
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:36,096
sufficient.

202
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:36,763
So both of these are useless.

203
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:37,429
I still don't know the
answer, which is e.

204
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,125
All right.

205
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:38,794
Well, I think I'm out of time.

206
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:39,444
I just passed the
10-minute mark.

207
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:40,114
I will continue in
the next video.

208
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:40,810
