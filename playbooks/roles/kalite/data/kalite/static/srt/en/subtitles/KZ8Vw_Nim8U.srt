1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,720
We're on problem 21.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,190
Stan's solution to an equation
is shown below.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,440
All right, and I haven't looked
at it yet, but let's

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,540
just see what they ask us.

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,440
Which statement about Stan's
solution is true?

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,550
So let's just work through it
and see if he got it right or

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,920
if he made a mistake.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,220
So let's see.

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,490
Let's think about it
how we would do it.

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:25,980
So if we had n plus 8 times
n plus 20 is equal to 110.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,380
So the first thing you want to
do is you'd want to distribute

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,330
this 8 times n plus 20.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,730
You don't want to multiply
this whole n plus 8.

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,680
Remember, you're doing order
of operations, so it's

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,480
multiplication first.
Let's do that.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,330
So you get the n plus and
you distribute this 8.

18
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:47,520
So it's 8n plus 160
is equal to 110.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,080
8 times n plus 8 times
20 is 160.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,660
And already I see a discrepancy

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,670
between ours and his.

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,560
We have n there.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,580
We have plus 8n there.

24
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,410
But where he has a
20, we have 160.

25
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,400
He didn't distribute the 8.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,810
8 times n plus 20
is 8n plus 160.

27
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,470
So that's wrong.

28
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,220
So he made a mistake
in step 1.

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,560
Unfortunately, he got all that
other work that he had to do

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,935
just because of his-- it's all
going to be wrong because of

31
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:16,300
his mistake.

32
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,060
Problem 22.

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,380
When is the statement true?

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,085
The opposite of a number is less
then the original number.

35
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,280
   

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,910
Well, I mean, if I have a
negative number, the opposite

37
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,670
of a negative is positive.

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,720
So it's not going to be less.

39
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,580
But if l positive number, then
the opposite of it is

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,520
negative, which is
less than it.

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,390
Because a negative is less
than a positive.

42
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:52,280
Or if we say that x is greater
than 0, then minus x is going

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,760
to be less than x.

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,580
If we say x is positive,
then definitely.

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,170
You know, minus 3 is less
than positive 3.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,130
So the statement is true
for positive numbers.

47
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,380
So that's C.

48
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,700
   

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,930
It's definitely not
never true.

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,960
I mean we showed a case
where it's true.

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,210
If I have positive 3, negative
3 is less than that.

52
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,830
Statement B.

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,550
The statement is always true.

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,650
Well no, if we start with
negative 3, the opposite is

55
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,620
going to be larger.

56
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,840
The opposite's going
to be positive 3.

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,290
And D.

58
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,710
The statement is true for
negative numbers.

59
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,910
No, it's not.

60
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,550
Negative 3, the opposite is 3.

61
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,730
And that's larger
than negative 3.

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,570
Problem 23.

63
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,230
What is the y-intercept
of the graph?

64
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,520
OK, let me see.

65
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,060
So 23.

66
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,330
They say 4x plus 2y
is equal to 12.

67
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,960
So if you were to graph this
line, not that I'm going to--

68
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,210
the y-intercept is when it
intersects the y-axis.

69
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,120
So it's that point there.

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,350
It's what's this y-coordinate.

71
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,660
Well the x-coordinate, it's
when x is equal to 0.

72
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,940
So it's going to be 0 comma
some y-intercept.

73
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,690
So the easiest thing to do
is say when x is equal

74
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,550
to 0, what is y?

75
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,990
So when x is equal to 0, this
4 times 0 is equal to 0.

76
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,030
So that just becomes 0.

77
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,950
So you get 2y is equal to 12.

78
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,000
y is equal to 6, and
that's choice C.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,020
All they want to know is, of
this line, when x is equal to

80
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,790
0, what's y?

81
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,110
That's what the y-intercept
is.

82
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,120
Next problem.

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,090
OK, they've drawn us a graph.

84
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,750
They say-- let me copy
and paste this one.

85
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,740
   

86
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,990
OK.

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,980
   

88
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,230
Copied it.

89
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,490
   

90
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,460
OK, which inequality is shown
on the graph below?

91
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,160
So first of all, let's figure
out the equation of

92
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,690
this line right now.

93
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,250
So what's its y-intercept,
first of all?

94
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:57,300
So when x is equal to 0,
y is equal to minus 1.

95
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,320
If we put it in slope y
intercept form, the equation

96
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,300
of really, any line is y
is equal to mx plus b.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,970
Where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept.

98
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,560
Here, when x is 0,
y is negative 1.

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,740
So the y-intercept is minus 1.

100
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,920
So b is minus 1.

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,630
So we know that y is equal
to mx minus 1.

102
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,470
And now we just have to
figure out the slope.

103
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,720
And the slope is just change in
y for a given change in x.

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,920
So if we say change in y for a
given change in x is equal

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,420
to-- let's see.

106
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,930
When I increase x by 2,
I increase y by 1.

107
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,280
So change in y is 1 when
the change in x is 2.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,030
And you could say when you
increase x by 4-- I'm going

109
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,290
four spots-- I increase
y by 2.

110
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,110
So you could have done that.

111
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,490
You could have said change in
y over change in x is 2/4,

112
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,030
which is also equal to 1/2.

113
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,000
But either way, we now
know the slope.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,320
The slope is change in
y over change in x.

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,570
So the equation of the line is
y is equal to 1/2 x minus 1.

116
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,930
That's the equation
of this line.

117
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,820
Now they want to know what the
equation of the inequality is.

118
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,520
So first of all, they're
including-- they have this

119
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,720
grey area and they put
this line in bold.

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
So that means that we're
including the line.

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,940
If they had drawn a dotted line
here that means we're not

122
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,540
including the line.

123
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,130
But since they're including
the line, it's going to be

124
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,600
either greater than or less
than or equal to.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,560
That equal to is because we're
including the line.

126
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,310
But just think about it.

127
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,830
So our choices are y is greater
than or equal to 1/2 x

128
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,900
minus 1 or y is less than or
equal to 1/2 x minus 1.

129
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,230
Now think about for
any given x.

130
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,550
Let's say when x
is equal to 2.

131
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,600
When x is equal to 2, if you put
it into this equation you

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,440
get y is equal to 0 and that's
this point on the line.

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,890
Now is the grey area all y
values greater than 0 or all y

134
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,140
values less than 0?

135
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,440
Well clearly, it's all y
values greater than 0.

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,760
It's all the y values
above the y value

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,010
dictated by this equation.

138
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,650
   

139
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,810
The equation of this inequality
or this area is y

140
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,040
is greater than 1/2 x minus 1.

141
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,390
And just a very easy way to
eyeball it is OK, they're

142
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,280
including the line, so I'm
going to have this equal

143
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,900
then-- it's going to either be
greater than or equal to or

144
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,930
less than or equal to, and since
it's the area above the

145
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,020
line it's going to be greater
than or equal to.

146
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,280
And that is choice D.

147
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,870
   

148
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,220
Next problem, problem 25.

149
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,720
This is another one where I
think it makes sense to copy

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,970
and paste it.

151
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,800
   

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,630
It's a big one.

153
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,880
OK.

154
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,950
   

155
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,560
Which best represents
the graph of y id

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,180
equal to 2x minus 2.

157
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,870
So the slope is 2.

158
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,940
Its positive 2 and its
y-intercept is minus 2.

159
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,290
So the y-intercept is
easy to eyeball.

160
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,280
Here the y-intercept
is minus 2.

161
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,130
That's right.

162
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,150
Here it's minus 2 as well.

163
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,260
In both of these, the
y-intercept is plus 2.

164
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,850
So neither of these are
going to, right?

165
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,430
It intersects the y-axis
at positive 2.

166
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,180
But we know that the y-intercept
is minus 2.

167
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,540
So we know-- whoops.

168
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,580
Where'd I go?

169
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,620
There we go.

170
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,010
So we know our choices are
one of the top two.

171
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,170
It's either A or C.

172
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,790
And which of these has
a positive slope,

173
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,980
positive slope of 2?

174
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:48,680
Well in choice A when I go to
the right by 2, I go up by 4.

175
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,590
So change in y over
change in x.

176
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,420
I go up by 4, when I
go up in x by 2.

177
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,760
I go up in y by 4 when I go up
in x by 2, so the slope is 2.

178
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,020
So this has a positive slope
of 2, so that's choice A.

179
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,000
But just for seeing why choice C
doesn't work or figuring out

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,940
the slope, think about
it this way.

181
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,380
Let me start at a random
point here.

182
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,450
   

183
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,220
If I increase x value
by 2, what's

184
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,540
happening to my y value?

185
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,040
Is it increasing by 2 or
is it decreasing by 2?

186
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,330
Well it's decreasing.

187
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,420
Well it's decreasing by 4.

188
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,740
It's decreasing at
twice the rate.

189
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,000
It's decreasing by 4.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,299
So in this case, change
in y over change in x.

191
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,400
Whenever x is positive 2,
we increased by 2 here.

192
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,559
What happened to y.

193
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,480
It went down 4.

194
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,669
So here the slope is minus 2.

195
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,600
And you can look at that.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,270
You can kind of eyeball it
because it's going from the

197
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,750
top left to the bottom right,
so it's going to

198
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,680
be a negative number.

199
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,790
But the easiest way I always do
is to draw these arrows and

200
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,390
say, OK, when I increase
x, y is decreasing.

201
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,700
So that's going to be
a negative slope.

202
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,240
Let's do it.

203
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,560
So the answer was A.

204
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,810
Next problem.

205
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,740
   

206
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,150
OK, so they're giving us another
one of these where

207
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,520
they shaded a graph.

208
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,350
These are good.

209
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,110
Thank God I have the cut
and paste feature.

210
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:18,980
   

211
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,860
So they ask us, which inequality
does the shaded

212
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,160
region of the graph represent?

213
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,550
So once again, it'll be good
just to figure out what the

214
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,780
equation of this line is.

215
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,230
We could immediately say, OK,
the y-intercept is 2.

216
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,910
And what's its slope?

217
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,930
When x increases by 1,
what happens to y?

218
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,685
y is going down by 3.

219
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:45,400
   

220
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,830
So the y-intercept
is equal to 2.

221
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,850
We figured that out.
b is equal to 2.

222
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,710
The slope is equal to change
in y over change in x.

223
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,500
When x increases by 1,
the slope-- sorry.

224
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,330
The change in y is minus 3.

225
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,960
It goes down by 3.

226
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,490
So the slope is equal
to minus 3.

227
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,820
So the equation of this
line is y is equal to

228
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,300
minus 3x plus 2.

229
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,540
mx plus b.

230
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,050
And if I look at the choices,
already it looks a little bit

231
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,400
different than that, but
we'll get to that.

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,410
But let's see what the
inequality is.

233
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,700
So first of all, it's going to
be either greater than or

234
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,430
equal or less than or equal.

235
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,900
And we say the or equal
because they

236
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,610
filled in the line.

237
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,540
So let's think about it.

238
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,870
If we pick any x, say when x is
equal to 2, then according

239
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,060
to this equation, according
to this line, y would be

240
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,880
equal to minus 4.

241
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,610
Now, are we including the y's
that are greater than that

242
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,110
value as well or are we
including the y's that are

243
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,165
less than that value?

244
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,980
Well, we're including the ones
that are less than that point

245
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,230
for a given x.

246
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,460
So the shaded region is y
is less than or equal to

247
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,770
minus 3x plus 2.

248
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,710
And you can eyeball this.

249
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,060
You can kind of say, oh, this
is below the graph, so it's

250
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,260
less than or equal.

251
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,720
And that equal was because
they shaded in the line.

252
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,350
If it was a dotted line it
would just be less than.

253
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,820
Once again, this isn't
the exact format

254
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,610
that they have here.

255
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,040
They put all the x's and the y's
on the same side, and we

256
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,110
can do that.

257
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,200
Let's just add 3x to both sides
of this equation and you

258
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,800
get 3x plus y is less
than or equal to.

259
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,245
When you add 3x on the
right-hand side that

260
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,690
just becomes 0.

261
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,690
So less than or equal to 2.

262
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,800
And that is 3x plus y is less
than or equal to positive 2.

263
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,760
And that is choice A.

264
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,700
And I'm all out of time, see
you in the next video.

265
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,950
