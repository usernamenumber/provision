1
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:02,577
You've probably heard of

2
00:00:02,577 --> 00:00:04,481
people having a stroke,

3
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:07,750
and you're probably familiar with the notion

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,049
that it has something to do

5
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,985
with the brain, and you'd be right.

6
00:00:10,985 --> 00:00:14,453
In particular, it's a rapid loss of

7
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:15,922
brain function because of

8
00:00:15,922 --> 00:00:17,903
something strange happening

9
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:20,938
with the blood flow to the brain.

10
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:21,960
And let me show you that

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,446
in a little bit more detail.

12
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:24,359
And to do that,

13
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,859
let's think about

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,604
the 2 major types of strokes.

15
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:32,708
There's the ischemic strokes,

16
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:35,377
and the other type of stroke

17
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:36,605
is hemorrhagic,

18
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,933
and these can kind of be sub-categorized,

19
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:44,159
but I won't go into all of the details there.

20
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,046
And if I really just define

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,399
ischemia and hemorrhaging to you,

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,390
I think you'll have an idea

23
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,921
of how these strokes are different

24
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,197
and how they interrupt the blood flow

25
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:55,751
to different parts of the brain.

26
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,192
You know from the videos on

27
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:59,141
stenosis and ischemia

28
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,613
and the videos on heart attacks

29
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,743
that ischemia is

30
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:03,087
a lack of blood flow

31
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,968
to certain body tissues.

32
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:07,918
So an ischemic stroke is actually

33
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,637
very, very similar to what we saw

34
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:10,844
in a heart attack,

35
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:11,502
except it's not occurring

36
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:12,858
in a coronary blood vessel,

37
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,792
it's occurring in a blood vessel

38
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,140
in the brain.

39
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,399
So let me draw that right over here.

40
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:19,482
Let's say that this is

41
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:24,123
a blood vessel in the brain.

42
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,562
And let's say that blood is flowing

43
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,689
in that direction (this is an artery).

44
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,510
And so you could imagine

45
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,835
that maybe there is a big blood clot

46
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:35,598
that forms in some part of the brain.

47
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:37,270
Let me do the blood clot in magenta.

48
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,755
This blood clot might form because --

49
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,566
no, that's not magenta --

50
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:41,867
the blood clot might form

51
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,621
because maybe there's a plaque there,

52
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:45,581
maybe the plaque got ruptured,

53
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,460
either way, this clot is restricting

54
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,314
the flow of blood.

55
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:50,706
And we know that this blood clot --

56
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:54,284
we can call this a thrombus,

57
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,363
or we could say that thrombosis

58
00:01:57,363 --> 00:01:58,667
has occurred over here--

59
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,667
either way, the blood flow is restricted,

60
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:05,491
and the brain tissue that's further downstream

61
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,269
is not going to get its oxygen,

62
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:11,135
and it might die; it might experience infarction.

63
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:13,250
And that's why ischemic strokes are also

64
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,471
sometimes called cerebral infarctions.

65
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,898
These are all very fancy words,

66
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,595
but I think, hopefully, they're becoming

67
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,561
a little bit more common in our vocabulary,

68
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,378
they keep showing up over and over again.

69
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:29,015
And I also want to be clear:

70
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,933
most strokes are actually

71
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,801
ischemic strokes.

72
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,318
The numbers I looked up, they say,

73
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,887
87% of strokes are ischemic.

74
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,558
Now, the other type of way

75
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:42,982
that you could have ischemia

76
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:44,004
in one of these blood vessels,

77
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,159
and this is completely analogous

78
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,578
to what we saw in the heart,

79
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,400
when we had heart attacks, is:

80
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,737
you could have thrombosis,

81
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,919
or you could also have an embolism.

82
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,891
Whenever someone says thrombosis,

83
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,609
or a thrombus, or thrombi,

84
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,205
they're talking about blood clots.

85
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,257
Whenever someone talks about

86
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:03,540
an embolus, or emboli, or embolism,

87
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,575
they're talking about something

88
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:05,933
moving through the blood

89
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:08,569
that eventually blocks a blood vessel.

90
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,298
So you can actually have

91
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,647
a thromboembolism,

92
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:14,096
you can actually have a blood clot

93
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:15,442
that gets broken off --

94
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,933
so let me ignore this for now--

95
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,116
let me paint over it a little bit

96
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,547
so that this isn't the main cause of blockage--

97
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:26,421
but you could actually have a blood clot

98
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:33,530
that breaks off, becomes an embolus,

99
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,753
and since it's an embolus due to a blood clot,

100
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,921
you call it a thrombembolus --

101
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,823
I always have trouble saying all of these words--

102
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:46,498
and eventually it blocks an artery over here.

103
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:51,713
So this right here is an embolism,

104
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,933
but either way, you're blocking the blood flow

105
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,600
further down the brain,

106
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,559
[which] could cause infarction,

107
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:57,937
that brain tissue will die,

108
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,118
and whatever that brain tissue did

109
00:04:00,118 --> 00:04:03,183
for mental function, or whatever,

110
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,529
is going to make it very hard

111
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:06,248
for this person who is experiencing this stroke

112
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,245
to do those things.

113
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:08,895
Now, it's not always noticeable,

114
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:11,913
that's called a silent stroke,

115
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,771
but damage is occurring.

116
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,072
The person experiencing the stroke--

117
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:16,110
and I'm not a doctor,

118
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,720
so take all of this with a grain of salt--

119
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,272
the person experiencing the stroke

120
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,358
could be anywhere from -

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,751
well, one, they may not even notice

122
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,391
that damage is occurring,

123
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:25,784
they might have a headache,

124
00:04:25,784 --> 00:04:26,838
or it might be more severe,

125
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:28,074
they might actually

126
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,667
not be able to properly move

127
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:30,954
a side of their body,

128
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:32,116
or a side of their face,

129
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:33,294
or properly be able to speak,

130
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:34,471
so it really depends on what

131
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,100
part of the brain is being damaged.

132
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,000
But in either of these situations,

133
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,723
an ischemic stroke is caused by

134
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,400
some type of restriction or blockage

135
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,667
that causes things downstream to not

136
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,364
get proper oxygen, and then,

137
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,170
so you can imagine,

138
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,365
cells over here aren't going

139
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,313
to get their oxygen,

140
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:53,045
and then they might actually die.

141
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,330
A hemorrhagic stroke -

142
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,063
to hemorrhage means to bleed,

143
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,267
it's literally just a fancy word for bleeding-

144
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:00,197
and so in a hemorrhagic stroke

145
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,441
you have a situation where a blood vessel

146
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:06,369
can actually break, where you have a blood vessel-

147
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,271
I'm actually trying to draw

148
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:09,917
the same blood vessel- where it actually breaks.

149
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:10,894
We'll talk more in the future

150
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,610
of why a blood vessel might break -

151
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,236
strongly related to high blood pressure

152
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:15,369
and other risk factors,

153
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:17,053
but I don't want to get into that right now -

154
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,738
but you could imagine if a blood vessel breaks,

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,667
you have all this blood spewing into the brain

156
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,593
in, kind of, an uncontrolled way.

157
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:26,281
So let's say this little diagram

158
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,610
[that] I drew right here,

159
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:29,129
that part of the brain,

160
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,152
if you have a hemorrhagic stroke,

161
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:31,296
you have all of this blood

162
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,733
that's flowing into the brain,

163
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,147
and all of that uncontrolled blood

164
00:05:35,147 --> 00:05:37,667
will mess up that part of the brain,

165
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,625
that causes those neurons

166
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,972
and brain tissue to malfunction

167
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,000
and maybe causes some of them to die,

168
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,189
and it would also cause

169
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,343
the blood flow further dowstream

170
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:47,905
to be impaired, so the stuff

171
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,901
downstream aren't going to get

172
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,911
the blood they need

173
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:51,715
because all the blood

174
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,795
is being released everywhere else.

175
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:57,718
And since 87% of strokes are ischemic strokes,

176
00:05:57,718 --> 00:05:59,594
the remainder are hemorrhagic,

177
00:05:59,594 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is the remaining 13% of strokes.
