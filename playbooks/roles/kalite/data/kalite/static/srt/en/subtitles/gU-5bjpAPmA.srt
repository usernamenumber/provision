1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,008
Where we left off in the last video,

2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:07,758
Toussaint L'Ouverture had just been betrayed by,

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:10,665
on some level, first by some of his right-hand men,

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:14,033
because they joined the side of Leclerc

5
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:17,035
or essentially they gave up rebelling against Leclerc,

6
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:18,750
convinced that Leclerc wasn't that bad,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,250
that he had no intention of reinstating slavery

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,638
or taking away the civil rights

9
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,515
of the freemen of African descent.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,960
This is another picture of Leclerc, right here.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,143
This is Leclerc.

12
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:34,995
So he had to essentially give up his arms.

13
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,021
He went to negotiate with Leclerc,

14
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,424
Leclerc imprisoned him,

15
00:00:38,424 --> 00:00:39,279
put him on a boat,

16
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:40,535
and sent him to France

17
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,366
and he died the next year in 1803.

18
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:47,292
So he was betrayed.

19
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:50,562
And died in prison in 1803.

20
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:53,170
And he really was, on a lot of levels,

21
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,369
one of the most important leaders

22
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,546
not just in Haitian history, but in general.

23
00:00:57,546 --> 00:00:59,667
When he took power, as I said before,

24
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,390
he didn't take revenge on the white population.

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,594
He helped the economy of Haiti

26
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:08,043
get back up and running.

27
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:11,630
He actually helped defend what is now Haiti,

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,550
but Saint-Domingue against the British Royal Navy.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,400
I forgot to mention that in the...

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,392
Defended against the British Navy,

31
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:27,865
which at the time was the...

32
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:31,074
by far the dominant navy in the world.

33
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,675
So this is what really earned his reputation

34
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:34,817
as a great general

35
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:37,005
on top of being a great leader

36
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,797
in terms of not exacting revenge,

37
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:41,374
in terms of not having slash and burn tactics,

38
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:44,430
in terms of not just ravaging his enemies.

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,318
So he was betrayed,

40
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:49,200
and then just to make it clear that

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,620
Leclerc really does deserve devil horns of a sort

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,155
although we're about to meet someone

43
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:58,788
who deserves much bigger devil horns,

44
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,532
or maybe that he was actually the henchman

45
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,889
for someone who deserves devil horns

46
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,969
In May of 1802

47
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,101
Napoleon signs a law that says...

48
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:17,012
that reinstates slavery where it has not disappeared.

49
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:25,535
Slavery where not gone

50
00:02:25,535 --> 00:02:27,720
And so it was a little bit ambiguous.

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,214
There were some areas where

52
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:32,040
slavery had still not disappeared.

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,430
Those include the French colonies at Martinique,

54
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,620
at Saint Lucia, at Tobago.

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,136
But in Haiti, things were ...

56
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,962
-- or Saint-Domingue, at that time--

57
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,680
things were a little ambiguous.

58
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,415
Had slavery truly disappeared,

59
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:52,812
or had it not disappeared yet?

60
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,440
Apparently, slaves were free in Haiti.

61
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,229
So it wasn't clear exactly what this meant for Haiti,

62
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,657
but at the same time,

63
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,020
the Haitians didn't even know this was happening.

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,750
This was May of 1802.

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,577
But just to make things clear,

66
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:11,565
Napoleon actually sent Leclerc a secret memo

67
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,630
to essentially reinstate slavery

68
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,308
when the time was right.

69
00:03:15,308 --> 00:03:26,724
reinstate slavery when right

70
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,540
So these guys, they were no jokers.

71
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,020
They knew the situation.

72
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,968
They knew that they needed the help

73
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:37,555
of some of Toussaint L'Ouverture's former generals,

74
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,623
former right-hand men,

75
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:41,860
in order to keep control of Haiti.

76
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,701
But the intention the entire time was,

77
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,705
when they have the upper hand,

78
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:49,097
to actually clamp down, reinstate slavery,

79
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:53,350
and take away the civil rights of the freemen of color.

80
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,000
Now these guys weren't stupid either.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,450
So you might remember Dessalines.

82
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,560
This was one picture of him.

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,452
He was also a former slave,

84
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,868
one of Toussaint L'Ouverture's right-hand men,

85
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,560
very effective general.

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,625
And, as you remember,

87
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,514
near the end of the fight against Leclerc,

88
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,296
he gave up the fight against Leclerc

89
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,438
and to some degree you could say

90
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:18,410
he turned on Toussaint L'Ouverture.

91
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,955
But he and some of the other

92
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:23,155
former followers of L'Ouverture

93
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:24,170
saw the writing on the wall.

94
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,320
They didn't even have to intercept that secret memo.

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,350
They got word from Martinique and Tobago and Saint Lucia

96
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,120
they got word that slavery was being reinstated.

97
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,768
The French at this time

98
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,133
were not people that you wanted to deal with or trust

99
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,360
when it came to issues of slavery.

100
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,720
So Dessalines and his comrades re-took up arms.

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,272
And Dessalines was a very different character

102
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,265
than Toussaint L'Ouverture.

103
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,406
The one similarity is that

104
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:01,220
they were both very effective military men.

105
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,698
The big difference between the two was that

106
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:12,515
Dessalines was not one to hold back.

107
00:05:12,515 --> 00:05:14,496
He wasn't afraid to

108
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:18,660
essentially take an eye for an eye, so to speak.

109
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,670
So here you had Dessalines in charge of what was,

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,200
I guess you could call, the slave rebel army.

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,923
And then on the other side of it,

112
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:30,555
you have Leclerc with the 40,000 troops

113
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:33,731
that he showed up, with Napoleon.

114
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,753
But lucky for Dessalines,

115
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,660
yellow fever-- and it's not lucky.

116
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,910
I mean, people died across the board.

117
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,177
But this did really turn the tide of war

118
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:49,370
in favor of the people of African descent on the island.

119
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:58,595
Yellow fever struck the island, it killed Leclerc,

120
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:02,000
and it also took out twenty something thousand--

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,870
or the number I read was 24,000--

122
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,750
of the actual French soldiers,

123
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,430
and another 8,000 were hospitalized.

124
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,270
So that's 32,000 out of commission,

125
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,485
so you're essentially only left with 8,000 soldiers.

126
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,910
So all of a sudden, it completely turned the tide,

127
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,038
completely changed the numbers in terms of

128
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:27,370
what types of forces the rebel army had to fight against.

129
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,030
But it wasn't all, I guess, good at this point because Leclerc-

130
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,018
I mentioned, I gave him little devil horns--

131
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,655
he was replaced by someone

132
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:44,725
who deserves very big devil horns named Rochambeau.

133
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,062
Not to be confused with his father,

134
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:49,272
who goes by the same name

135
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:52,718
who was a hero of the American Revolution.

136
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:55,379
He fought for France on the side of the Americans.

137
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,825
But his son...

138
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,102
And he, as far as I can tell,

139
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,451
seemed like a decent guy.

140
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,570
But his son was really evil.

141
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,382
And there are very few people in history

142
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,990
that you can say are unambiguously evil.

143
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,700
He is one of them.

144
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,736
Now that he was kind of desperate,

145
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:16,812
his forces were ravaged by yellow fever,

146
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:21,205
he's going against a fairly aggressive enemy,

147
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:25,011
he did things like, he would bury ---

148
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,284
let me write these down because they are evil.

149
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:33,035
He would bury African--

150
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,070
or I guess I should say African Americans.

151
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,605
He would bury former slaves, or people of African descent--

152
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:48,170
bury in, bury alive in pits of insects.

153
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:58,825
He would boil people alive in molasses.

154
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,650
I read one account that says that at one point he held a ball

155
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:08,178
where he invited all of the prominent mixed-race people

156
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:11,199
to a party essentially at his place

157
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,920
and at the stroke of midnight he announced that

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,097
all of the men are to be murdered.

159
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:19,322
So this guy, I mean, you know, cruelty... he definitely..

160
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:20,264
The only bounds on his cruelty

161
00:08:20,264 --> 00:08:24,355
was the people that he could get his hands on,

162
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:26,000
especially the people of African descent.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,618
The one positive of his cruelty is that

164
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:33,657
he for the first time really unified

165
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:37,419
the population of African descent on the island.

166
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:47,834
So he unified both the slaves, the former slaves,

167
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:56,545
and the mixed-race.

168
00:08:56,545 --> 00:09:03,160
And at the same time, we're now in 1803.

169
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,090
And, I've said it before,

170
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:11,140
we're still at war with Britain.

171
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,269
And Britain is-- and I've mentioned it before--

172
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,308
they had the most dominant navy in the world.

173
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:25,777
Dominant navy

174
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:29,538
This guy, despite how evil and how cruel he was,

175
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,348
he needed reinforcements from Napoleon

176
00:09:31,348 --> 00:09:34,360
if he had to take on Dessalines.

177
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,390
And let me be very clear about this.

178
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,369
Dessalines, as I mentioned,

179
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,150
he was not hesitant to take an eye for an eye.

180
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,132
In one incident,

181
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:48,144
Rochambeau buried 500 rebel prisoners alive,

182
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:52,898
then Dessalines went and hung 500 French prisoners.

183
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,446
So he wasn't someone

184
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:58,540
to kind of shy away from, I guess, blood.

185
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,610
And this is very different to Toussaint L'Ouverture.

186
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,470
It's kind of a lesson.

187
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,703
If you are fighting an enemy,

188
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:11,835
if you get rid of the more reasonable leaders of your enemy,

189
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:16,558
you might end up getting maybe a leader

190
00:10:16,558 --> 00:10:19,089
more similar to yourself and your cruelty,

191
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,620
if you betrayed the more reasonable ones.

192
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,330
But anyway, enough of my commentary.

193
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,470
So the stage is set.

194
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,340
War with Britain.

195
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,940
Britain owns the seas, especially the Caribbean.

196
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,515
This guy needs reinforcements going against

197
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:42,160
a very strong leader of the former slave rebels.

198
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,890
But Napoleon, he's known to be one to cut his losses.

199
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,380
He did it with his troops in Egypt.

200
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,247
He's really not someone who really cares,

201
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:50,833
I think, about the individual.

202
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,280
He cares much more about his ego and his power.

203
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:02,818
So Napoleon leaves them hanging.

204
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:03,800
Napoleon saw the writing on the wall.

205
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,655
He wouldn't be able to get through the British fleet.

206
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:07,706
And at the same time,

207
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,550
Napoleon's fighting all of these wars in Europe.

208
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,720
As you remember, the whole French Revolution

209
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,090
was precipitated by France being broke.

210
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,748
So Napoleon, not only does he give up on this guy--

211
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:18,431
and he essentially got what he deserved--

212
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:22,402
Napoleon gives up on maintaining all of their colonies

213
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:25,150
or any major presence in the Western Hemisphere.

214
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,166
So essentially to raise funds,

215
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,346
Napoleon also sells Louisiana to the Americans.

216
00:11:31,346 --> 00:11:33,746
Now when I say Louisiana, I'm not talking about

217
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:36,930
just the state of Louisiana in its present state,

218
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,900
which is about that big.

219
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,800
That's actually where I was born.

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,342
We're talking about the whole--

221
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:44,180
this is like 1/3 of the United States today.

222
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,118
Sold all of this.

223
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,472
And he was clearly desperate.

224
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:56,330
He sold it for $15 million,

225
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:03,350
or that's the equivalent of F60 million

226
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,405
And I've been told, in today's money,

227
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:08,803
that would be on the order of $10 billion.

228
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:10,377
So, this is still a very...

229
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,582
You know, if someone said for $10 billion,

230
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:14,793
you could own 1/3 of the land of the United States,

231
00:12:14,793 --> 00:12:16,850
you would say that's a pretty good deal.

232
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,100
$10 billion in today's money.

233
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,874
So $15 million 1803, $10 billion today,

234
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,730
that's still not a lot of money, but he was desperate.

235
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,383
He realized that he couldn't maintain control of

236
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,935
something halfway around the world

237
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,485
when Britain owned the seas

238
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:34,463
and he was busy having his own troubles in Europe

239
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,410
So the Americans got a good deal.

240
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,580
And frankly, if he didn't sell it to the Americans,

241
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,860
either the British or the Americans could have probably

242
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,890
just taken it anyway.

243
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,572
So being left to hang to dry by Napoleon,

244
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:53,107
Dessalines is able to destroy Rochambeau

245
00:12:53,107 --> 00:13:00,410
and essentially declare independence for Saint-Domingue.

246
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:09,250
And in 1804, January 1,

247
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,922
Dessalines declares independence for,

248
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,760
and he names the new country Haiti,

249
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,640
which is the indigenous peoples' name for the island.

250
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,010
It means land of the mountains.

251
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,349
Now I want to just leave with one note,

252
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:27,100
because you may or may not be aware.

253
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,261
Haiti is still a very, very, very, very poor country.

254
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:35,230
And besides, after Dessalines, they had many, many, many--

255
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,158
and eventually, I'll do videos on it--

256
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,280
rounds of one dictator after another.

257
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,120
And the people have really been through a lot.

258
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,834
But I just want to make it clear that

259
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:45,330
they really got started off on a horrible foot.

260
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,645
Because even though Dessalines

261
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,507
declared independence in 1804,

262
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:58,899
the French did not recognize Haiti until 1805-- sorry- 1825.

263
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,224
French recognize

264
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,933
And the only reason that not recognize...

265
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,982
And you might say, well, who cares about recognition?

266
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:10,995
Who cares what the former colonial masters think?

267
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:12,890
But until they recognized them,

268
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,050
they were essentially embargoing Haiti.

269
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,000
They weren't allowing any trade

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,740
to actually go on with Haiti.

271
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,130
So it was really on the front of a barrel gun.

272
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,230
And in order to be recognized,

273
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:39,402
Haiti had to agree to F90 million of debt to France.

274
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:41,911
And just to be clear how much money this is,

275
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:47,702
here's a small island-- or half of an island--

276
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,870
of newly freed slaves

277
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,392
and they were forced to owe France--

278
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:58,527
and this actually was further reinforced by

279
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:00,140
the United States and Great Britain.

280
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,291
So it goes to show you,

281
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,518
even former enemies can kind of agree

282
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:08,100
when it comes to a oppressing small impoverished islands.

283
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,582
But they had to owe France

284
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:13,950
the equivalent of one and a half times

285
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,240
what the United States paid for the Louisiana Purchase.

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,530
This was F60 million.

287
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,720
They got all of Louisiana.

288
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,830
Now France is telling Haiti, you owe us F90 million.

289
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,332
Or that's roughly the equivalent of

290
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:31,233
$14 or $15 billion in today's terms.

291
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,580
And this is for a population of

292
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,230
essentially half a million freed slaves.

293
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,970
So it's kind of a horrendous amount of debt.

294
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,982
And just to be clear, this isn't something...

295
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:45,458
this wasn't like the crazy colonials in the early 19th century,

296
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:46,173
forcing to do this.

297
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:58,720
This debt was not paid off with the interest until 1947.

298
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
They were continuing to pay the debt.

299
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,272
And just to add insult to injury,

300
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:09,740
the reason for the debt, they claim, was for lost property.

301
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,820
So that's why France claimed that

302
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,713
Haiti owed them the money, for lost property.

303
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,840
Where, included in the list of lost property

304
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,300
was land and slaves.

305
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,014
Essentially, now that you've got your freedom,

306
00:16:26,014 --> 00:16:28,942
you owe us a ton of money for,

307
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,277
essentially us losing the rights to own you.

308
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:32,890
So it's just insult to injury.

309
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,687
And actually, I was shocked

310
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,248
the first time I learned this number,

311
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:38,189
that they were forced to continue to pay debts from

312
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:43,360
one poor country, one small poor country, right over here,

313
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,061
they had to continue to pay debts

314
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:50,207
to a Western developed nation until 1947,

315
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,246
essentially to buy their freedom.
