1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:06,233
In the video on electronegativity, we learned how to determine whether a covalent bond is polar or nonpolar.

2
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:10,724
In this video we're going to see how we can figure out whether molecules are polar or non polar,

3
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:16,053
and also how to apply that polarity to what we call "inter-molecular forces.

4
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:20,572
Intermolecular forces are the forces that are between molecules.

5
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:26,300
And so thats different than an intra-molecular force, which is the force within a molecule.

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,584
So the force within a molecule would be something like a covalent bond.

7
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:34,260
An intermolecular force would be the force that is between molecules.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,107
So lets look at the first intermolecular force.

9
00:00:37,107 --> 00:00:39,367
Its called a dipole-dipole interaction

10
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:42,253
and lets analyze why it has that name.

11
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:44,840
If i look at one of these molecules of acetone here,

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,601
and I focus in on the carbon thats double bonded to the oxygen,

13
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,658
I know that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon,

14
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:57,091
and so we have 4 electrons in this double bond between the carbon and the oxygen.

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,912
I'll try to highlight them right here.

16
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:04,433
Since oxygen is more electronegative, oxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it

17
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:07,644
therefore giving oxygen a partial negative charge.

18
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,753
Those electrons in yellow are moving away from this carbon,

19
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:13,313
so this carbon is losing a little bit of electron density

20
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:17,033
and this carbon is becoming partially positive, like that.

21
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:22,033
For this molecule, we're going to get a separation of charge.

22
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:23,736
A positive and a negative charge.

23
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:28,046
We have a polarized double bond situation here, we also have a polarized molecule.

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,095
And so there's two different poles, a negative and a positive pole.

25
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:38,967
We say that this is a "polar molecule". So acetone is a relatively polar molecule.

26
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:43,633
The same thing happens to this acetone molecule down here, so we get a partial negative

27
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:47,769
And we get a partial positive. So this is a polar molecule as well,

28
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:51,300
and it has two poles. We call this a dipole.

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,773
Each molecule has a dipole moment. And because each molecule is polar and has a separation of positive

30
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:02,711
and negative charge, in organic chemistry we know that opposite charges attract.

31
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:08,510
So this negatively charged oxygen is going to be attracted to this positively charged carbon.

32
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:13,369
There's going to be an electrostatic attraction between those two molecules.

33
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:18,593
And thats what's going to hold these two molecules together, and you would therefore need energy

34
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:24,915
if you were to try to pull them apart. The boiling point of acetone turns out to be

35
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:32,433
approximately 56 degrees celsius. Room temperature is between 20 and 25, at room temperature

36
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,606
we have not reached the boiling point of acetone.

37
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:37,114
And therefore acetone is still a liquid.

38
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:43,367
At room temperature and pressure, acetone is a liquid. And it has to do with the intermolecular force

39
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:47,354
of dipole-dipole interaction holding those two molecules together.

40
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:52,696
And the intermolecular force, in turn, depends on the electronegativity.

41
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:57,071
Lets look at another intermolecular force, and this one's called hydrogen bonding.

42
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:04,433
Here we have two water molecules and once again, if I think about these electrons here

43
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:10,274
which are between the oxygen and the hydrogen, I know oxygen is more electronegative

44
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,033
than hydrogen, so oxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it, giving the oxygen

45
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,376
a partial negative charge, like that.

46
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:21,100
The hydrogen is losing a little bit of electron density, therefore becoming partially positive.

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,153
The same situation exists in the water molecule down here.

48
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,556
So we have a partial negative and we have a partial positive.

49
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:34,100
Like the last example, we can see there's going to be some sort of electrostatic attraction between those opposite charges.

50
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,767
Between the negatively partially charged oxygen and the partially positive hydrogen, like that.

51
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:42,655
This is a polar molecule, of course water is a polar molecule.

52
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:48,507
You would think that this would be an example of dipole-dipole interaction, and it is,

53
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:54,967
except that in this case its an even stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction that we call "hydrogen bonding".

54
00:03:54,967 --> 00:04:01,176
At one time it was thought that it was possible for hydrogen to form an extra bond

55
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:05,173
and thats where the term originally comes from.

56
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:14,185
But of course its not an actual intra-molecular force, its an inter-molecular force, but it is the strongest intermolecular

57
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:21,433
force. The way to recognize when hydrogen bonding is present as opposed to just dipole-dipole is to see what

58
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:31,300
the hydrogen is bonded to. In this case, we have a very electronegative atom, oxygen, bonded to hydrogen.

59
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,180
That hydrogen is interacting with another electronegative atom like that.

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,587
We have a partial negative, and a partial positive, and we have another partial negative over here.

61
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,591
This is the situation that you need to have when you have

62
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,745
hydrogen bonding. Here's your hydrogen showing intermolecular force here,

63
00:04:48,745 --> 00:04:53,233
and what some students forget, is that this hydrogen actually has to be bonded to

64
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:59,063
another electronegative atom in order for there to be a big enough difference in electronegativity for

65
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:05,367
there to be a little bit extra attraction. And so the three electronegative elements that you should remember

66
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:10,583
for hydrogen bonding are: Fluorine, Oxygen, and Nitrogen.

67
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:14,920
The mnemonic that students use is "FON". So if you remember "FON" as the

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,700
electronegative atoms that could participate in hydrogen bonding, you should be able to remember

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,833
this intermolecular force. The boiling point of water is of course about 100 degrees celsius.

70
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,391
Higher than what we saw for acetone.

71
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:37,333
This is due to the fact that hydrogen bonding is a stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction, and therefore

72
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:42,975
takes more energy or more heat to pull these water molecules apart in order to turn them into a gas.

73
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,319
So, of course, water is a liquid at room temperature.

74
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,980
Alright, lets look at another intermolecular force. This one is called "london dispersion forces".

75
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:00,373
These are the weakest intermolecular forces, and they have to do with the electrons that are always moving around

76
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:07,635
in orbitals. Even though the methane molecule here, if we look at it, and we have a carbon surrounded by

77
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:13,042
hydrogens for methane. And its hard to tell from how i've drawn the structure here, but if you go back and

78
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:19,433
see the video for the tetrahedral bond angle proof, you can see that in three dimensions, these hydrogens are

79
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:22,498
coming off the carbon and they're equivalent in all directions.

80
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:27,227
There's a very small difference in electronegativity between the carbon and the hydrogen.

81
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:31,876
That small difference is cancelled out in three dimensions, and so the methane molecule becomes

82
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:36,970
non-polar as a result of that. So this one is non polar and this one is non polar.

83
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,732
There's no dipole-dipole interaction, there's no hydrogen bonding.

84
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:46,567
The only intermolecular force thats holding two methane molecules together would be london dispersion forces.

85
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:52,382
Once again you can think about the electrons that are in these bonds moving in those orbitals.

86
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:58,833
Lets say for the molecule on the left, for a brief transient moment in time,

87
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,910
you get a little bit of negative charge on this side of the molecule, so it might turn out to be

88
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,578
those electrons have a net negative charge on this side, and then for this molecule

89
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:13,646
the electrons could be moving the opposite direction giving this a partial positive.

90
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:18,833
There could be a very small bit of attraction between these two methane molecules.

91
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:23,416
Its very weak, which is why london dispersion forces are the weakest intermolecular force, but

92
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:27,967
it is there. And thats the only thing thats holding together these methane molecules.

93
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:34,300
Since its weak, we would expect the boiling point for methane to be extremely low, and of course

94
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,604
it is. So the boiling point for methane is somewhere around negative 164 degrees celsius.

95
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:48,033
Since room temperature is somewhere around 20-25, obviously methane has already boiled, if you will,

96
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:52,673
and turned into a gas. Methane is obviously a gas at room temperature and pressure.

97
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,102
Methane is a gas .

98
00:07:55,102 --> 00:08:01,920
If you increase the number of carbons, you're going to increase the number of attractive forces

99
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,339
that are possible, and if you do that, you can actually increase the boiling point of other hydrocarbons

100
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:15,167
dramatically. Even though london dispersion forces are the weakest, if you have larger molecules and you

101
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:20,500
sum up all those extra forces, it can actually turn out to be rather significant when you're working with

102
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,033
larger molecules. This is just a quick summary of some of the intermolecular forces to show you

103
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:32,849
the application of electronegativity, and how important it is.
