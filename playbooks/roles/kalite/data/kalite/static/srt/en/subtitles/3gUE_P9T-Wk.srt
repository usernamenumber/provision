1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:02,376
In the video on the Cambrian explosion

2
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:06,103
I talked about how suprisingly, or somewhat surprisingly

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:09,373
animals were the first to colonize

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:10,657
or to move on land.

5
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:13,388
They did that before plants did.

6
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,123
And someone brought up a question which I thought was a very good question.

7
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:18,457
If they were the first, what did they eat?

8
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:20,798
I thought it was a good question

9
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:23,842
and it justified a video on clarifying

10
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:26,794
exactly who was first on the land.

11
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:30,303
So right here, this is a picture of algae on the coast

12
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,103
this is kind of algal scum right here.

13
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,123
So this is algae.

14
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,045
And just to be clear

15
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:39,969
sometimes cyanobacteria, which we talked about as the first

16
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:42,537
photosynthetic organism

17
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:45,208
Sometimes that's called blue-green algae

18
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,969
but that's really bacteria.

19
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,324
Algae is considered eukaryotic

20
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,969
it just doesn't have the structures of modern plants.

21
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,566
So this is algae right here.

22
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:56,207
And our best estimate

23
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,148
is that algae actually colonized coastal rocks

24
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,790
about 1.2 billion years ago.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,220
1,2 Ga

26
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:09,308
G for "Giga".

27
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:12,254
So if you wanted the first thing that even resembled

28
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:14,798
or was close to plants or animals

29
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:17,332
and if you consider algae close to a plant,

30
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:20,468
then this would be the winner of who got on land first.

31
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:25,740
Now in the last video where I talk about animals

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,066
colonizing the land first

33
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,748
they weren't animals that only existed on land.

34
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:34,047
They were animals that probably spent

35
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:36,867
most of their time in the ocean collecting food or whatever

36
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,507
and they would show up on land to lay eggs.

37
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:40,636
And if you think about it, back then

38
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:42,635
the land would have been a really good place to lay eggs

39
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,637
because there wouldn't have been much else on the land.

40
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,131
So you would have been protected from predators.

41
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,777
So it might have been slug-like creatures like this

42
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,571
Some people talk about spider-like creatures

43
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:56,396
but it still would have been at the coast.

44
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,887
And these would have been creatures that spent

45
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,463
a lot of time in the ocean

46
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:02,969
and some time on land.

47
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,639
So this is what I was referring to

48
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:10,195
as kind of animals colonizing the land before plants.

49
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:19,502
And this would have happened about 530 million years ago.

50
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:24,479
Now the first living organisms to fully live on the land

51
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,637
their whole life is on the land

52
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,547
those would be plants.

53
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,934
So it depends if you think about things that

54
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:33,569
live part of their lives on land, you'd get the animals

55
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,005
things that live their whole life on land, then you'd get the plants.

56
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,638
So this right here, this is what we think

57
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:42,969
the first primitive plants would have looked like.

58
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:46,119
And the evidence, we actually don't have fossils of the plants themselves

59
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:48,922
we have fossils of their spores.

60
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:53,704
But we think that these, the earliest fossils of their spores, that shows that these existed

61
00:02:53,704 --> 00:03:01,411
were about 475 million years ago.

62
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,316
So 1.2 billion years ago you have the algae

63
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,126
530 million years ago we have evidence

64
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,389
of things kind of oozing out of the ocean and maybe laying their eggs

65
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,236
475 million years ago we have evidence

66
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,473
of what we would call "really" plants

67
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:27,001
but the evidence is really the fossils of their spores.

68
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:30,722
And then the first evidence of what you could call

69
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,969
real 'animals' that have spent their entire life on the land

70
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:40,969
the oldest fossil we have was discovered in Scotland fairly recently in 2004

71
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:43,056
and it was...

72
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,648
this is the fossil over here, it was discovered by a bus driver, Mike Newman

73
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:54,438
it was a bus driver in Scotland, and they actually named the thing after him.

74
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:59,834
It is called Pneumodesmus newmani, they got the Newmani from Mike Newman

75
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:02,655
and this fossil is 428 million years old

76
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:10,636
428 million years old

77
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:14,846
and right now it is the oldest fossil we have of a true land animals

78
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,323
if we think about true land animals

79
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,902
if you think about true plant versus true land animals that spend their entire life on the land

80
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:25,837
if you think about about things that spend part of their time on the land,

81
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,870
the the animals would probably the one out

82
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,904
if you view algae as plants, then plant were the one out

83
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,091
so it depends where you want to draw the line.

84
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,929
this first fossil, this is a real myriapode

85
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:40,503
which just means "a lot of legs". Let me write it over here.

86
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:43,983
Myriapods. You probably know the word "myriad"

87
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,797
that means a bunch of thing or a huge amount,

88
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:50,586
so myriapods - a huge amount of legs.

89
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,908
And you might be familiar with the milipedes and centipedes,

90
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:55,560
those are myriopods. So those first primitive myriapods

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,459
428 million years ago, and they would have lived

92
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,208
off of plants and maybe other myriapods and other slugs

93
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,324
or whatever other animals they would have found,

94
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:07,191
might have looked something like that.

95
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,106
So hopefully, it gives a little bit of clarification.

96
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:13,380
It wasn't like, you know, you had dogs sitting on the land

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,644
and they had nothing to eat.

98
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:19,790
It is kind of argeement what you define a plant or an animal

99
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,971
and who gets the brandining rights

100
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,901
for being the first on the land and it depends on

101
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:25,892
what you consider a plant or an animal

102
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:31,848
and whether spending part of your life on the land,

103
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,008
will actually qualify.
