1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's say I have a position
vector function that looks like

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:12,202
this. r of t is equal to x of t
times the unit vector i plus y

4
00:00:12,202 --> 00:00:15,075
of t times the unit vector j.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,030
And let me actually graph this.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,580
So let's say, r of t, I want
to draw it a little bit

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,875
straighter than that.

8
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:28,630
So that's my y-axis, that is my
x-axis, and let's say r of t,

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,900
and this is for t is less
than, let me write this.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,810
So this is for t is
between a and b.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,220
So when t is equal to a, we're
at this vector right here.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,170
So if you actually substitute t
is equal to a here, you'd get

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,070
a position vector that would
point to that point over there.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,670
And then, as t increases, it
traces out a curve, or the

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,210
endpoints of our position
vectors trace a curve that

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,730
looks something like that.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,190
So when t is equal to b, we get
a position vector that points

18
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,510
to that point right there.

19
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,800
So this defines a path.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,570
And the path is going in
this upward direction,

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,950
just like that.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,770
Now let's say that we have
any another position

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,440
vector function.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:27,630
Let me call it r of t.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,220
It's a different one.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,970
It's the green r.

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,350
r of t.

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,950
Instead of being x of t times
i, it's going to be x of a plus

29
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,890
b minus t times i, and instead
of y of t, it's going to be y

30
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,470
of a plus b minus t times i.

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,640
And we've seen this in
the last two videos.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,310
This, the path defined by this
position vector function is

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,020
going look more like this.

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,640
Let me draw my axes.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,820
This is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,430
Maybe I should label
them, y and x.

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,710
This path is going to
look just like this.

38
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,390
But instead of starting here
and going there, when t is

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,780
equal to 1, let me make it
clear, this is also true for

40
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,840
a is less than or equal to
t, which is less than b.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,750
So t is going to
go from a to b.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,900
But here, when t is equal
to a, you substitute it

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,660
over here, you're going
to get this vector.

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,520
You're going to start over
there, and as you increment t,

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,600
as you make it larger and
larger and larger, you're going

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,010
to trace out that same path,
but in the opposite direction.

47
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,910
   

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,750
And so when t is equal to b,
you put that in here, you're

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,550
actually going to get x of a
and y of a there, right, the

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,300
b's cancel out, and so you're
going to point right like that.

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,480
So these are the same, you
could imagine the shape of

52
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,310
these paths are the same, but
we're going in the exact

53
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,750
opposite direction.

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,180
So what we're going to do in
this video is to see what

55
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,390
happens, how, I guess you could
say, if I have some vector

56
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:17,010
field f of xy equals p
of xy i plus q of xy j.

57
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,220
Right?

58
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,250
This is just a vector
field over the x-y plane.

59
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,800
How the line integral of this
vector field, of this vector

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,640
field over this path, compares
to the line integral the same

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,500
vector field over that path.

62
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,280
How that compares to this.

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,770
We'll call this
the minus curve.

64
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,020
So this is the positive
curve, we're going to call

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,910
this the minus curve.

66
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,400
So how does it, going over
the positive curve, compare

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,330
to going over the minus
curve? f of f dot dr.

68
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,640
So before I break into the
math, let's just think

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,310
about a little bit.

70
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,540
Let me draw this
vector field f.

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,720
So maybe it looks, I'm just
going to draw random stuff.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,540
So you know, on every point in
the x-y plane, it has a vector,

73
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,560
it defines or maps a vector, to
every point on the x-y plane.

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,800
But we really care about the
points that are on the curve.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,600
So maybe on the curve, you
know, this is the vector field

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,685
at the points on the curve.

77
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,150
And let me draw it
over here, too.

78
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,520
So all the points on the curve
where we care about, this is

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,120
our vector field, that
is our vector field.

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,030
And let's just get an intuition
of what's going to be going.

81
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,990
We're summing over the dot,
we're taking each point along

82
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,440
the line, and we're summing,
let me start over here.

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,153
We're taking each point along
the line, let me do it

84
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,450
in a different color.

85
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,035
And we're summing the dot
product of the value of the

86
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:53,910
vector field at that point, the
dot product of that, with dr,

87
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,430
or the differential of our
position vector function.

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,770
And dr, you can kind of
imagine, as an infinitesimally

89
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,620
small vector going in the
direction of our movement.

90
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,080
And we take this dot product
here, it's essentially, it's

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,340
going to be a scalar value,
but the dot product, if you

92
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,530
remember, it's the magnitude
of f in the direction of dr,

93
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,350
times the magnitude of dr.

94
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,750
So it's this, you can imagine
it's the shadow of f onto

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,040
dr. Let me zoom into that,
because I think it's useful.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,880
So this little thing that I'm
drawing right here, let's

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,070
say that this is my path.

98
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,470
This is f at that point.

99
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,260
f at that point looks
something like that.

100
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,500
And then dr at this point
looks something like that.

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,840
Let me do it in different
color. dr looks

102
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,230
something like that.

103
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,930
So that is f.

104
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,300
And so the dot product of these
two says, ok, how much of f is

105
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,670
going in the same
direction as dr?

106
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,940
And you can kind of
imagine, there's a shadow.

107
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,800
If you take the f that's going
in the same direction as dr,

108
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,410
the magnitude of that times the
magnitude of dr, that

109
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,400
is the dot product.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,170
In this case, we're going
to get a positive number.

111
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,360
Because this length is
positive, this length is

112
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,030
positive, that's going to
be a positive number.

113
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,180
Now what if our dr was going
in the opposite direction,

114
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,600
as it is in this case?

115
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,445
So let me draw maybe that
same part of the curve.

116
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,360
   

117
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,500
We have our f, our f will
look something like that.

118
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm drawing this exact
same part of the curve.

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,470
But now our dr isn't
going in that direction.

120
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,470
Our dr that at this point
is going to be going in

121
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,730
the other direction.

122
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,800
We're tracing the curve in
the opposite direction.

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,540
Our dr is now going to be
going in that direction.

124
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,110
   

125
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,430
So if you do f dot dr, you're
taking the shadow, or how much

126
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,550
of f is going in the direction
of dr, you take the shadow

127
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,550
down here, it's going in the
opposite direction of dr. So

128
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,840
you can imagine that when you
multiply the magnitudes, you

129
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,930
should get a negative number.

130
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,870
Our direction is now opposite,
they're not going in the-- the

131
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,320
shadow of f onto the same
direction is dr is going in the

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,540
opposite direction as dr.
In this case, it's going in

133
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,090
the same direction as dr.

134
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,010
So the intuition is that maybe
these two things are the

135
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,480
negative of each other.

136
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,490
And now we can do some
math and try to see if

137
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,090
that is definitely,
definitely the case.

138
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,170
So let us first figure out,
let's write an expression for

139
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:29,830
the differential dr. So in this
case, dr, dr dt is going to be

140
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:40,990
equal to x prime of t times i
plus y prime of t times j.

141
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,130
In this other example, in the
reverse case, our dr, dr

142
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,350
dt, is going to be, what's
it going to be equal to?

143
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,540
It's the derivative of
x with respect to t.

144
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,530
The derivative of this term
with respect to t, that's the

145
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,260
derivative of the inside, which
is minus 1, or minus, times

146
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,840
the derivative of the outside
with respect to the inside.

147
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,080
So that's going to be,
derivative of the inside is

148
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,350
minus 1, times the derivative
of the outside with respect to

149
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,260
the inside. x prime of a
plus b minus t times i.

150
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,640
And then same thing
for the second term.

151
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,930
Derivative of y of this term
with respect to the inside,

152
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,960
which is minus 1, times the
derivative of the outside with

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,470
respect to the inside, which is
y prime of a plus b minus t.

154
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,240
So this is going to be the
derivative of the inside,

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,650
times y prime of a
plus b minus is t j.

156
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,660
So this is dr dt in this case,
this is dr dt in that case.

157
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,620
And if we wanted to write the
differential dr in the forward

158
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,510
curve example, it's going to be
equal to x prime of t times i

159
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:58,870
plus y prime of t times
j times the scalar dt.

160
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,220
I could multiply it down into
each of these terms, but

161
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,060
it keeps it simple, just
leaving it on the outside.

162
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,150
Same logic over here.

163
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,510
dr is equal to minus x.

164
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,850
I changed my shade of green,
but at least it's still green.

165
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:21,100
a plus b minus t i minus y
prime a plus b minus t j,

166
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,320
and I'm multiplying
both sides by dt.

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,940
Now we're ready to express
this as a function of t.

168
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,870
So this curve right here, I'll
do it in pink, the pink one is

169
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,340
going to be equal to the
integral from t is equal to a

170
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:53,630
to t is equal to b of f of f of
x of f of x of t y of t dot

171
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,820
this thing over here, which is,
I'll just write out here, I

172
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,002
could simplify it later.

173
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:06,260
x prime of t i plus
y prime of t j.

174
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,930
And then all of that
times the scalar dt.

175
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,230
This'll be a scalar value, and
then we'll have another scalar

176
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,190
value of dt over there.

177
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,490
Now, what is this going
to be equal to if I take

178
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,630
this reverse integral?

179
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,275
The reverse integral is going
to be the integral from, I'm

180
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:26,880
going to need a little more
space, from a to b, of f of not

181
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,220
x of t, but x of a plus b minus
t y of a plus b minus t.

182
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,550
I'm writing it small
so I have some space.

183
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,160
Dot, this is a vector, so dot
this guy right here, dot dr.

184
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:53,800
Dot minus x prime of a plus b
minus t i, minus y prime of,

185
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,110
I'm using up too much space.

186
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,770
Let me scroll, go
back a little bit.

187
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,680
Actually, let me take it
make it even simpler.

188
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,690
Let me take this minus
sign out of it.

189
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,400
Let me put a plus, and
then I'll put the

190
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,790
minus sign out front.

191
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,260
So the minus sign is just a
scalar value, so we could put

192
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,710
that minus sign out, you know,
when you take a dot product,

193
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,180
and if you multiply a scalar
times a dot product, you could

194
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,680
just take the scalar out,
that's all I'm saying.

195
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,880
So we take that minus sign
out to this part right here.

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:30,030
And then you have x prime of a
plus b minus t i plus y prime

197
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:39,970
of a plus b minus t, scroll
over a little bit, t j dt.

198
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,130
So the this is the forward,
this is when we're following it

199
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,930
along the forward curve, this
is when we're following it

200
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,490
along the reverse curve.

201
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,230
Now like we did with the
scalar example, let's

202
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:51,990
make a substitution.

203
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,100
I want to make it very
clear what I did.

204
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,330
All I did here, is I just
took the dot product,

205
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,600
but this negative sign,
I just took it out.

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,290
I just said, this is the same
thing as negative 1 times this

207
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,200
thing, or negative 1 times this
thing is the same

208
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,230
thing as that.

209
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,610
So let's make a substitution on
this side, because I really

210
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,900
just want to show you that this
is the negative of that, right

211
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,880
there, because that's what
our intuition was going for.

212
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,220
So let me just focus
on that side.

213
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,980
So let me make a substitution.

214
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,530
u is equal to a plus b minus t.

215
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,720
Then we get du is equal
to minus dt, right?

216
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,770
Just take the derivative
of both sides.

217
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,230
Or you get dt is
equal to minus du.

218
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,890
And then you get, when t
is equal to a, u is equal

219
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,050
to a plus b minus a.

220
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,070
So then, u is equal to b.

221
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:49,140
And then when t is equal to
b, u is equal to a, right?

222
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,530
Which is equal to b, a
plus b minus b is a.

223
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,230
u is equal to a.

224
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,813
So this thing, using that
substitution simplifies to, and

225
00:12:57,813 --> 00:13:03,380
this is the whole point, that
simplifies to minus integral

226
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,010
from u is, when t is a, u is b.

227
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,570
From b, when t is b, u is a.

228
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,930
The integral from u is equal
to b to u is equal to a of

229
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:21,140
f of x of u y of u, right?

230
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,000
That is u, that is u.

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:39,330
Dot x prime of u times i,
that's u right there, plus

232
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,240
y prime of u times j.

233
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,360
And then, instead of a
dt, I need to put a du.

234
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,970
dt is equal to minus du.

235
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,190
So I could write minus du
here, or just to not make it

236
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,780
confusing, I'll put the du
here, and take the

237
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,900
minus out front.

238
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,230
I already have a minus out
there, so they cancel out.

239
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,730
They will cancel out,
just like that.

240
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,480
And so you might say, hey Sal,
these two things look pretty

241
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
similar to each other.

242
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,770
They don't like they're
negative of each other.

243
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,080
And I'd say, well, you're
almost right, except this guy's

244
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,240
limits of integration are
reversed from this guy.

245
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,810
So this thing right here, if
we reverse the limits of

246
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,730
integration, we have to
then make it negative.

247
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:29,390
So this is equal to minus the
integral from a to b of the

248
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:40,920
vector f of x of u y of u dot
x prime of u i plus

249
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,540
y prime of u j du.

250
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,900
And now this is identical.

251
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,510
This integral, this definite
integral, is identical to

252
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,620
that definite integral.

253
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,870
We just have a
different variable.

254
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,620
We're doing dt here, we have du
here, but we're going to get

255
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,220
the same exact number for any a
or b, and given this

256
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:06,050
vector f and the position
vector path r of t.

257
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,430
So just to summarize everything
up, when you're dealing with

258
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,500
line integrals over vector
fields, the direction matters.

259
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,530
If you go in the reverse
direction, you're going to get

260
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,520
the negative version of that.

261
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,610
And that's because at any point
we take the dot product, you're

262
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,060
not going in the, necessarily,
you're going in the opposite

263
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,330
direction, so it'll be the
negative of each other.

264
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,730
But when you're dealing with
the scalar field, we saw on the

265
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,430
last video, we saw that it
doesn't matter which direction

266
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,100
that you traverse the path in.

267
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,490
That the positive path
has the same value as

268
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,210
the negative path.

269
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,600
And that's just because we're
just trying to find the

270
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,590
area of that curtain.

271
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,670
Hopefully you found
that mildly amusing.

272
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,266
