1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Let's see if we can apply
what we've learned to a

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,890
particularly hairy problem
that I have constructed.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,600
So let me see how I can
construct this.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,780
So let's say in parallel, I have
this resistor up here.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,590
And I try to make it
so the numbers work

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,760
out reasonably neat.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,000
That is 4 ohms. Then I have
another resistor right here.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,340
That is 8 ohms. Then I have
another resistor right here.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,760
That is 16 ohms. And then, I
have another resistor here,

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,640
that's ohms. Actually, I'm now
making it up on the fly.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,990
I think the numbers
might work out OK.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,710
16 ohms.

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,750
And let's say that now here in
series, I have a resistor that

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:07,720
is 1 ohm, and then in parallel
to this whole thing-- now you

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,080
can see how hairy it's getting--
I have a resistor

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:22,420
that is 3 ohms. And let's say
I have a resistor here.

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,640
   

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,650
Let's just make it
simple: 1 ohm.

20
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:36,010
And just to make the numbers
reasonably easy-- I am doing

21
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,850
this on the fly now-- that's
the positive terminal,

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,140
negative terminal.

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,370
Let's say that the voltage
difference is 20 volts.

24
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,050
So what I want us to do is,
figure out what is the current

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,540
flowing through the wire
at that point?

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,010
Obviously, that's going to be
different than the current at

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,090
that point, that point, that
point, that point, all of

28
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,710
these different points, but it's
going to be the same as

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,880
the current flowing
at this point.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,370
So what is I?

31
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,920
So the easiest way to do this
is try to figure out the

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,040
equivalent resistance.

33
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
Because once we know the
equivalent resistance of this

34
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,940
big hairball, then we can just
use Ohm's law and be done.

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,460
So first of all, let's just
start at, I could argue, the

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,090
simplest part.

37
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,310
Let's see if we could figure out
the equivalent resistance

38
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,550
of these four resistors
in parallel.

39
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,160
Well, we know that that
resistance is going to be

40
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:34,800
equal to 1/4 plus 1/8
plus 1/16 plus 1/16.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,450
So that resistance-- and
now it's just adding

42
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,100
fractions-- over 16.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:48,740
1/4 is 4/16 plus 2/16 plus 1
plus 1, so 1/R is equal to 4

44
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,170
plus 2 is equal to 8/16-- the
numbers are working out-- is

45
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,260
equal to 1/2, so that equivalent
resistance is 2.

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,490
So that, quickly, we just
said, well, all of these

47
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,110
resistors combined is equal to
2 ohms. So let me erase that

48
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,620
and simplify our drawing.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,020
   

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,510
Simplify it.

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:29,310
So that whole thing could now
be simplified as 2 ohms. I

52
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,240
lost some wire here.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to make sure that
circuit can still flow.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,910
So that easily, I turned that
big, hairy mess into something

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,540
that is a lot less hairy.

56
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,950
Well, what is the equivalent
resistance of this resistor

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,330
and this resistor?

58
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,290
Well, they're in series, and
series resistors, they just

59
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,710
add up together, right?

60
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,770
So the combined resistance of
this 2-ohm resistor and this

61
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,510
1-ohm resistor is just
a 3-ohm resistor.

62
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,580
So let's erase and simplify.

63
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,280
So then we get that combined
resistor, right?

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,360
We had the 2-ohm that we
had simplified and

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,610
then we had a 1-ohm.

66
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,200
   

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,250
So we had a 2-ohm and a 1-ohm
in series, so those simplify

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,880
to 3 ohms.

69
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,300
Well, now this is getting
really simple.

70
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,670
So what do these two resistors
simplify to?

71
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,710
Well, 1 over their combined
resistance is

72
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,040
equal to 1/3 plus 1/3.

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,870
It equals what?

74
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,770
2/3.

75
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:41,560
1/R is equal to 2/3, so R is
equal to 3/2, or we could say

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,960
1.5, right?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,100
So let's erase that and
simplify our drawing.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,905
So this whole mess, the 3-ohm
resistor in parallel with the

79
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,980
other 3-ohm resistor is equal
to one resistor with a 1.5

80
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,020
resistance.

81
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,600
And actually, this is actually
a good point to give you a

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,320
little intuition, right?

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,550
Because even though these are
3-ohm resistors, we have two

84
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,880
of them, so you're kind of
increasing the pipe that the

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,790
electrons can go in by a
factor of two, right?

86
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,150
So it's actually decreasing
the resistance.

87
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,590
It's giving more avenues for the
electrons to go through.

88
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,500
Actually, they're going to be
going in that direction.

89
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,880
And that's why the combined
resistance of both of these in

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,160
parallel is actually half
of either one of these

91
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,565
resistances.

92
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,090
I encourage you to think about
that some more to give you

93
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,610
some intuition of what's
actually going on with the

94
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,100
electrons, although I'll do a
whole video on resistivity.

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,180
OK so we said those two
resistors combined-- I want to

96
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,010
delete all of that.

97
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,210
Those two resistors combined
equal to a 1.5-ohm resistor.

98
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,850
   

99
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,540
That's 1.5 ohms. And now all
we're left with is two

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,270
resistors in parallel, so the
whole circuit becomes this,

101
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,860
which is the very basic one.

102
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,270
This is a resistor: 1.5
ohms, 1 ohm in series.

103
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,300
Did I say parallel just now?

104
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,510
No, they're in series.

105
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:13,210
1.5 plus 1, that's 2.5 ohms.
The voltage is 20

106
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,710
volts across them.

107
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,920
So what is the current?

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,860
Ohm's law.

109
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,920
V is equal to IR.

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,500
Voltage is 20 is equal to
current times our equivalent

111
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,290
resistance times 2.5 ohms. Or
another way to write 2.5 five

112
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,410
is 5/2, right?

113
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,060
So 20 is equal to I times 5/2.

114
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,570
Or I is equal to 2/5 times
20, and what is that?

115
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,950
2/5 is equal to I
is equal to 8.

116
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,470
8 amperes.

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,590
That was not so bad,
I don't think.

118
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,850
Although when you saw it
initially, it probably looked

119
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,540
extremely intimidating.

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,190
Anyway, if you understood that,
you can actually solve

121
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,920
fairly complicated circuit
problems. I will see you in

122
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,510
future videos.
