1
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:07,678
For over four hundred years, the problem remained.

2
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:11,770
How could Alice design a cipher that hides her fingerprint,

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,497
thus, stopping the leak of information.

4
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:18,135
The answer is randomness.

5
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:21,210
Imagine Alice rolled a 26 sided-dice

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,525
to generate a long list of random shifts,

7
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:27,042
and share this with Bob, instead of a code word.

8
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:28,893
Now, to encrypt her message,

9
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:31,987
Alice uses the list of random shifts instead.

10
00:00:31,987 --> 00:00:35,890
It's important that this list of shift is long as the message

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,628
as to avoid any repetition.

12
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,093
Then, she sends it to Bob, who decrypts the message

13
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:45,148
using the same list of random shifts she'd given him.

14
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:48,574
Now Eve will have a problem,

15
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,875
because the resulting encrypted message

16
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,509
will have two powerful properties:

17
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:57,175
One, the shifts never fall into a repetitive pattern;

18
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:03,874
and Two, the encrypted message will have a uniform frequency distribution.

19
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:06,208
because there's no frequency differential,

20
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,172
and therefore no leak,

21
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:11,206
it's now impossible for Eve to break the encryption.

22
00:01:14,052 --> 00:01:17,668
This is the strongest possible method of encryption,

23
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:21,586
and it emerges toward the end of the 19th century,

24
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:24,198
it's now known as the one time pad.

25
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:29,229
In order to visualize the strength of the one time pad,

26
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:34,784
we must understand the combinatorial explosion which takes place.

27
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:38,917
For example, the Caesar cipher shifted every letter by the same shift,

28
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:42,960
which was some number between 1 and 26.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,008
So if Alice was to encrypt her name,

30
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,384
it would result in 1 of 26 possible encryptions,

31
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:52,251
a small number of possibilities, easy to check them all,

32
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,834
known as brute force search.

33
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,844
Compare this to the one time pad,

34
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:58,990
where each letter would be shifted

35
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,808
by a different number between 1 and 26,

36
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:03,934
Now think about the number of possible encryptions,

37
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,908
it's going to be 26 multiplied by itself 5 times,

38
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,920
which is almost 12 millions.

39
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,884
Sometimes it's hard to visualize.

40
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,949
So imagine she wrote her name on a single page,

41
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,854
and on top of it, stack every possible encryption.

42
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,505
How high do you think this would be?

43
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:28,869
With almost 12 million possible five letter sequences,

44
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:32,032
this stack of paper would be enormous,

45
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:35,241
over one kilometer high.

46
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:38,103
When Alice encrypts her name using the one time pad,

47
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:42,375
it's the same as picking one of these pages at random,

48
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,663
from the perspective of Eve, the codebreaker,

49
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,397
every five letter encrypted word she has

50
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:51,578
is equally likely to be any word in this stack.

51
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:54,645
So, this is perfect secrecy in action.
