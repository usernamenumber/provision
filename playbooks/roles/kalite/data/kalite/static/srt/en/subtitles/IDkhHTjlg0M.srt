1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,560
We're on problem 210.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,460
A television manufacturer produces 600 units of a

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:15,180
certain model each month at a cost to the manufacturer of

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,280
$90 per unit.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,890
And all of the produced units are sold each month.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,760
What is the minimum selling price per unit that will

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,600
ensure that the monthly profit--

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,790
revenue from sales minus manufacturer's cost to produce--

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,040
on the sales of these units will be at least $42,000.

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,020
OK. So, they want to know the minimum selling price.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,150
So, let's call that p.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,010
So how much are they going to make per unit?

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,520
p minus whatever their cost was. p minus $90.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,400
That's how much they make per unit.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,300
And they do that for 600 units.

16
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,700
And they say that this has to be at least $42,000.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,180
So, this has to be greater than or equal to 42,000.

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:18,420
OK. So we get 600p minus-- what's 9 times 6? It's 54.

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,070
And then we have one, two, three 0's. 54,000-- Right?

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,590
9 times 6. Yep.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,760
--is greater than or equal to 42,000.

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,870
So then you get 600p. Let's add 54,000 to both sides.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:42,030
Has to be greater than or equal to 54 plus 42 is 96,000.

24
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,050
And just to simplify things, let's divide both sides by 100.

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,430
So, you get 6p. If you get two 0's here, two 0's here.

26
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,010
6p has to be greater than 960.

27
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,610
And then p has to be greater than or equal to--

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,660
we don't have to worry about this because

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,050
it's a positive number.

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,840
6 goes into 96, 16 times, so it goes into 960, 160 times.

31
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,850
So the minimum selling price is $160 which is choice d.

32
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,620
Problem 211.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,160
If 4x plus 3y is equal to minus 2,

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:35,020
and 3x plus 6 is equal to 0, what is the value of y?

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,010
Well this is a quick one. 3x would be equal to minus 6.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,720
So x is equal to minus 2. Substitute back here.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,030
4 times minus 2, minus 8 plus 3y is equal to minus 2.

38
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,010
Add 8 to both sides. 3y is equal to minus 2 plus 8.

39
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:03,390
Or 3y is equal to 6.y is equal to 2. And so that is choice e.

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,640
Problem 212. I'll do it in a different color. 212.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
The data sets one, two, and three above are ordered from

42
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,840
greatest standard deviation to least standard deviation in

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,420
which of the following? OK.

44
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,040
So they want us to order them essentially.

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:33,670
Greatest-- So, set one was 72, 73, 74, 75, 76.

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:44,510
Set two is 74-- it says 74 a bunch of times-- 74, 74.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:55,050
And then set three has 62, and then 74, 74, 74, and then 89.

48
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,220
So, standard deviation is how much, on average,

49
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,140
do the numbers vary from the mean.

50
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:07,020
And all of these cases,the mean is 74.I'm just eyeballing it.

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,540
Let's see 89 is 15 more. Actually here the mean isn't 74.

52
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,250
So, first of all, every number here is the mean.

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,110
So, the standard deviation is actually 0.

54
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,110
So this is going to be-- they want to know from greatest

55
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,510
standard deviation to least standard deviation.

56
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,650
So, 2 is definitely the least standard deviation.

57
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,520
So that leaves us with choices either b or d.

58
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,930
And now have to figure out

59
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,070
which of these have a lower standard deviation.

60
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,780
So here we can just eyeball and say the average is 74.

61
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,580
If you average this and this you get 74,

62
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,150
that and that you get 74. So, what's the difference from 74?

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,510
Here it's 2.Here it's 1.Here it's 0.Here it's 1. Here it's 2.

64
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,830
You just want the magnitude,

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,040
how far away you are from 74 each time.

66
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,970
And if you were to average these numbers,

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,380
you get 2 plus 1, plus 1 plus 2.

68
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,010
That's 6 divided by 5. So, you get 6 over 5.

69
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,600
You know they square-- you could even do the variance if

70
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,000
you really cared about it, you could square these numbers.

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,300
But you just want to get some measure of, on average,

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
how far is each of the numbers from the mean.

73
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,860
So here's 6 over 5. Let's see 2 plus 1, 3.

74
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,420
Yep. 6-- and there's five numbers.

75
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,040
And 6 over 5 is the standard deviation there.

76
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,030
What's the mean here? This is interesting.

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,180
So, 74 to 89. Do I have those numbers right? Yeah.

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,520
to go from 74 to 89 you have to go plus--let me add these up.

79
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,420
You get 62-- actually what's the average of 62 and 89?

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,820
No, it's not 74.

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:57,360
Let's see 2 plus 11 is-- well I could just take the average--

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,690
I just want to figure out the mean as fast as possible.

83
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,790
So 89 and 62. 9 plus 2 is 11. 9 plus 6-- 151.

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,530
You divide that by 2. The mean of these two numbers are 75.5.

85
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,120
So, at least if you're trying to figure out the mean,

86
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,220
that's going to be the same thing is the mean of--

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,150
so actually let's just do this. It's 151.

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,210
Let's just take the average of everything.

89
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,460
I tried to be cute, but it's better to just be brute force.

90
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:38,050
So, 62 plus 89 is 151, plus 74 times 3, divided by 5.

91
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:48,060
Let's see. 74 times 3. 4 times 3 is 12. 7 times 3 is 21. 22.

92
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,040
And then 222 plus 151 is 3 7 3.

93
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,440
And then we're going to divide that by 5.

94
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:06,660
So, 5 goes into 373-- 7 times 5 is 35, 23, 5 goes into 23

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,180
4 times, 4 times 5 is 20.

96
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,830
3. 74.6. So the mean here is 74.6.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,130
This is going to have the largest standard deviation

98
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,770
because this is 0.6 from the means,

99
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,430
this is 0.6 from the mean, this is 0.6 from the mean.

100
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,630
This number is 12.6 from the mean.

101
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,060
And then this number is 14.4 from the mean.

102
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,370
So, if you're to average these numbers,

103
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,150
you're going to get a bigger number than 6/5,

104
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,610
but let's just confirm it. So, 12.6 plus 14.4-- oh yeah,

105
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,070
you're definitely going to get a much bigger number

106
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,390
because when you summed all these up, you got a 6.

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,190
When you just sum up the 12.6 and the 14.4 you get-- 15--

108
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,500
you get 27. And then it's going to get to 29.

109
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,620
You divide that by 5.

110
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,210
The standard deviation here is going to be 4.

111
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,180
So, 3 has the largest standard deviation.

112
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,410
2 has the least. So, the correct answer is d.

113
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,590
I should've been able to eyeball that.

114
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,470
I shouldn't have had to go through all that computation.

115
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,700
I took too much time.

116
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,610
That wouldn't have been acceptable on the GMAT.

117
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,570
Problem 213.

118
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,000
Which of the following is the lowest positive integer that

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,740
is the divisible by all of those numbers?

120
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,010
So, it's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,000
So the lowest positive integer that

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,020
is divisible by all of those.

123
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,280
So, one way to think about it is let's just try to minimize

124
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,130
our multiplication.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,560
If we're divisible bye 8,

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,850
then we don't have to worry about 2 and 4.

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,250
Being divisible by 8 is enough.

128
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,660
Likewise if we're divisible by 9,

129
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,230
we don't have to worry about being divisible by 3

130
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,760
because we're definitely going to be divisible by 3.

131
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,420
We need to be divisible by 7.

132
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,780
If we're divisible by 6-- well, if we're divisible by 8

133
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,480
and 9 then that means we're already divisible by 2 and 3.

134
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,550
And if we're divisible by 2 and 3

135
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,390
then we don't have to worry about 6.

136
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,020
So, we only have to worry about 5, 7, 8, and 9.

137
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,550
So what are those numbers when you multiply by each other?

138
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,900
So if we do 8 times 9 is 72.

139
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,630
8 times 9 is equal to 72, we got rid of those,

140
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,020
times 7 is equal to 2 times 7 is 14.

141
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,850
7 times 7 is 49, plus 1 is 50. And that times 5.

142
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,500
4 times 5 is 20. 5 times 0 is 0. Bring down the 2.

143
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,390
5 times 5 is 25. So, it's 2,520. And that is choice c.

144
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,410
And I'm out of time.

145
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,010
See you in the next video.
