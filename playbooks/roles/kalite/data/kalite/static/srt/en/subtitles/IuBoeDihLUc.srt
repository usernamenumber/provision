00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:03,620
In this video i want to clarify two ideas

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:05,743
that we talk about on a regular basis

3
00:00:05,743 --> 00:00:08,754
but they are really kind of muddled up in our popular language

4
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:14,141
And these are the ideas of mass and weight.- Mass and weight

5
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:17,392
and first I `ll tell you what they are and then we'll talk about how they are muddled up

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:22,918
So mass is literally, there's a couple of ways to view mass.

7
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:25,800
One way to view mass - this is not a technical definition

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,008
but will give you sense of it, how much stuff there is

9
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:34,123
so this is similiar to saying "matter". So if I have more molecules

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,661
of a given mass; I will have a total of more mass.

11
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,771
So if I have more atoms, I will have more mass.

12
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,125
How much stuff there is of something,

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,399
And I want to be careful with this definition right here because there are other things that arenÂ´t, what would be what we traditionally associate with matter

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,851
and I don't want to start going into more fancy physics

15
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:59,118
that still will exhibit mass, so another way to define mass is

16
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:04,900
how does something react to a specific force,

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,100
we have already learnt it in the second law.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,705
if you have a given force, and you have more mass

19
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:12,998
you'll accelerate less and if you have less mass,

20
00:01:13,044 --> 00:01:14,323
you'll accelerate more.

21
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:17,262
So, how something responds to force?

22
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:22,002
how something responds to force, to a given force?

23
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:27,253
Something with lower mass will acelerate more for a given force

24
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,371
and something with higher mass will accelerate less

25
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:49,467
Now weight is the force of gravity on a mass or on an object. So this is the force of gravity on an object,

26
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:53,383
Just let`s think about, the differences right here,

27
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:57,702
Let`s think about I guess myself sitting on Earth,

28
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:07,436
so if I am on Earth, my mass is 70 kilograms, my mass (let me use a new colour), my mass is 70 kilograms

29
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:12,543
There is 70 kilograms of stuff that constitute Sal.

30
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,895
But my weight is not 70 kilograms

31
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:18,649
you often tell, here people say " I weigh 70 kilograms",

32
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:22,672
and that's all right in just conversational usage but that is not technically correct.

33
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,916
Because weight is the force that Earth is pulling down, or I should say

34
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:29,235
the force of gravity on my mass,

35
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:41,933
and so my weight, the weight is going to be equal to the gravitational

36
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,237
field at Earth , let me just....

37
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:49,720
We did hopefully watch the video on gravity, if you haven't, feel free to watch it,

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:58,736
the gravitational attraction between two objectss, so the force of gravity between two objects is going to be a big G.

39
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,594
the universal gravitational constant

40
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:10,333
times the mass of the first object times the mass, (let me actually do it), times the mass of the first object

41
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:17,267
times the mass of the second object , divided by the distance that separates

42
00:03:17,267 --> 00:03:20,086
the two objects squared

43
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:21,898
And if you are on Earth,

44
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:25,566
if you take all of the stuff over here combined,

45
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:31,854
so if you say that this right here is the mass of Earth,

46
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:35,982
if you say this right here is the distance from the centre to surface of Earth

47
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:39,532
`cause there is where I'm sitting right now.

48
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:46,268
distance from centre to surface of Earth

49
00:03:48,717 --> 00:03:52,916
Then all of this stuff over here simplifies to what

50
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,667
is sometimes called lower case g,

51
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,633
and lower case g is,

52
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,630
and I'm just rounding it here,

53
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,974
is 9.8 meters per second squared.

54
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:07,246
So the force of gravity for something near the surface of the Earth,

55
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:11,565
is going to be this quantity right over

56
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:15,280
here times the mass, times its mass.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:25,636
So my weight on the surface of the Earth is this 9.8 meters per second squared

58
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:33,810
times my mass, times 70 kilograms

59
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,596
so this is going to be,

60
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:46,163
And I could get my calculator, why don't I just get my calculator rather than do the maths? I was going to round to 700 but let 's just actually calculate it,

61
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:51,085
so we have 9.8 times 70 kilograms,

62
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:57,215
so we have 686. so this gives me 686 and then the units

63
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:08,082
are kilograms meters per second squared, and these units kilograms meters per second squared are the same thing as a NEWTON, a NEWTON

64
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,914
So my weight, and you will never hear people say this,

65
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:19,576
my weight on the surface of the Earth is 686 Newtons, 686 Newtons

66
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:24,917
and notice i just said that is my weight on the surface of the Earth,

67
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,493
because as you can imagine weight is the force due to gravity

68
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,267
on an object, on on a mass.

69
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:34,762
So if you go some place else, if I go to the moon for example

70
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:39,081
my weight will change, but my mass will not.

71
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:42,750
This is the weight on Earth.

72
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:51,480
If I were to take my weight on the moon, the weight on the moon

73
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,753
And I've had to look this up before the video, and you can verifiy this for me if you like,

74
00:05:55,753 --> 00:06:00,583
But I have been told that the gravitational force on the moon,

75
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,555
or the gravitational attraction at the surface on the moon

76
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,759
is about 1/6 of that of the surface of the Earth,

77
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,892
so my weight on the moon will be roughly

78
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:14,002
1/6 of my weight on the Earth.

79
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:21,202
So times 686 Newtons, so that gives me a little bit over, what is that? 114? , maybe

80
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,284
I'll just get the calculator out.

81
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:27,750
my brain operates a little bit slower,

82
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,954
while I'm recording videos , I got that right.

83
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:35,552
Yes 114 approximately, 114 Newtons.

84
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:38,153
This is the thing I really want to emphasize,

85
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:41,171
weight is the force due to gravity on a object

86
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:45,490
your weight changes from planet to planet you go on.

87
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:51,234
Your weight would actually even change as you, as you, if you went to a very high altitude,

88
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:56,566
because you are getting slightly farther, you would be inmesurably small.

89
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,492
You would be slightly farther from the centre of the Earth

90
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:02,417
your weight would change an imperceptible amount,

91
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:08,222
in fact because the Earth is not a perfect sphere,because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, it's slightly, it's often referred to

92
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:11,600
an oblix spheroid.

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,731
Your weight is actually slightly different, your weight is actually slightly different on different parts of the Earth.

94
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,098
If you went to the Poles versus the Equator

95
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:23,799
you would have a slightly different,a slightly different weight.

96
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,661
Your mass does not change, it doesn`t matter where you go,

97
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:32,451
assuming you don`t have some type of nuclear reaction going on inside of you.

98
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:42,750
Your mass does not change, your mass does not change depending on where you are.

99
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,884
Now you might be saying hey, look! You know, I don't deal with kilograms and Newtons

100
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:51,732
and all of this, I operate in America and in America we talk about pounds

101
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:55,573
Is pounds aproppiate? And yes, pounds is a unit of weight

102
00:07:55,573 --> 00:08:05,088
so if I say, if I say that I weigh one hundred and sixty pounds,

103
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,368
this is indeed weight

104
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:07,647
I'm saying that the force of gravity on me

105
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:11,032
I'm saying that the force of gravity on me

106
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:15,351
is a hundred and sixty pounds but then you may say what is mass then?

107
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:20,669
if you are talking about the English system or sometimes called the Imperial System

108
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:26,147
and here I'll introduce you to a concept that very few people note

109
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:29,306
kind of a good trivial concept, the unit of the mass, the unit of mass

110
00:08:29,306 --> 00:08:36,551
Let's just speak clear in the Imperial System

111
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,313
mass is called the slug, mass, the unit of mass is called the slug

112
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,575
mass the unit of mass is called slug so if you are so many slug

113
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:47,882
so if you wanted to figure out how many slugs you are, so your weight, the force of gravity on you is one hundred and sixty pounds,

114
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:52,480
one hundred and sixty pounds, this is going to be equal to

115
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,217
if you are to take, if you are to calculate, if you are to calculate all of the stuf,f the force of gravity

116
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:59,492
on the surface on the Earth but if you are doing it,if you are doing it in Imperial units

117
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:04,168
instead of getting 9.8 meters per second squared

118
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:08,495
instead of getting 9.8 meters per second squared, you would get 32 feet per second squared

119
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:12,625
you would get 32 feet per second square which

120
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,443
also the acceleration on, near the surface of the Earth

121
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:18,951
due to gravity in feet and seconds it's supposed

122
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,412
to meters and seconds and this is times your mass,

123
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:28,424
times your mass in slugs, in slugs,

124
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,421
so to figure it out you divide both sides by thirty

125
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,346
two per second squared so let's do that,

126
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:44,202
let's divide both sides by thirty two feet per second squared, let's divide both sides by thirty two feet per second squared

127
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,767
cancels out and then let me get my calculator out so I have

128
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:54,036
one hundred and sixty pounds divided by thirty two feet per second squared

129
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:58,448
and I get exactly five, (I should be able to that in my head), so I get five, and the units here,

130
00:09:58,448 --> 00:09:59,946
the numerator I have pounds

131
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:04,439
I have pounds, I have pounds and then I'm dividing

132
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,340
by feet per second square that's the same thing as multiplying by

133
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,609
second squared per feet and these units five pounds second squared

134
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:18,612
over feet this is the same thing as a slug, so if I were one hundred

135
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:27,125
and sixty pounds my mass is going to be equal to, my mass is going to be equal to

136
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:31,443
five slugs, so if my mass

137
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:35,019
is seventy kilograms, mass is seventy kilograms, my weight

138
00:10:35,019 --> 99:59:59,999
six hundred and eighty six Newtons, so hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.
