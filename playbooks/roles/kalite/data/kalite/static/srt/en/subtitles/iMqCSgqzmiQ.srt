1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,454
Hey everybody, it's LeBron here.

2
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,696
I got a quick brain teaser for you.

3
00:00:07,696 --> 00:00:11,076
What are the odds of making 10 free throws in a row?

4
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:13,971
Here's my good friend Sal with the answer.

5
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:18,005
That's a great question, LeBron, and I think the answer might surprise you.

6
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,065
So, I looked up your career free-throw percentage

7
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:25,262
and you are right at around, 75%, which is a little bit higher

8
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:28,657
than my free-throw percentage. And one way to interpret that: if we

9
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:32,749
have a million LeBron James, and you can imagine any large number

10
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,983
of LeBron James is taking a free throw.

11
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,859
Let's say, this line represents all of the

12
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,990
LeBron James' that take that first free-throw

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,955
Let's call that free throw number 1

14
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:48,633
We would expect, on average, that 75% of them would make that first free-throw.

15
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:53,061
So, let me draw 75%, so this is about halfway. So this would be 25,

16
00:00:53,077 --> 00:00:55,753
This would get us for 75. So we would expect

17
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:59,352
75% of them would make that first

18
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:00,688
free-throw.

19
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:05,752
75%, and then the other 25% we would expect on average

20
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:07,742
would miss that first free-throw.

21
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,923
Now, what we care about are the ones that keep making the

22
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:10,805
free-throws.

23
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,479
We want ten in a row!

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,450
So, let's just focus on the 75% that made the first one.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,681
Some of these 25% might make some free-throws going forward.

26
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,996
But we don't care about them anymore.

27
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,750
They are kind of out-of-the-game!

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,681
So, let's go to free-throw number two.

29
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,038
Free throw ... number two.

30
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:30,119
What percentage of the folks who made of the Lebron James-es,

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,988
that made the first free-throw,

32
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:34,027
what percentage would we expect to make the second one?

33
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,025
And we're going to assume, whether or not you made the first one,

34
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,652
has no bearing on the probability of you on making the second,

35
00:01:39,652 --> 00:01:41,706
that this continues to be the probability

36
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:44,552
of a Lebron James making a given free throw.

37
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:49,464
So we would expect 75% of these Lebron James' to also make the second one.

38
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:53,118
We are going to take 75 percent of 75 percent.

39
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,399
So this is about half of that 75%; this would be a quarter,

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,103
this would be three fourths, which is about 75%, which is exactly 75%.

41
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:02,953
So right over here.

42
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:06,639
This represents the ones that made the first one,

43
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,462
how many also made the second one.

44
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,774
So you could say that the percentage of the Lebron James-es

45
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,366
that we would expect on average

46
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,498
to make the first two free-throws.

47
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:21,263
This is...This is the length right over here is 75 percent of 75%.

48
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:24,567
75% of this 75% right over there.

49
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:27,560
And I think you might began to see a pattern emerging,

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,606
Let's go to the 3rd free-throw: free throw number 3.

51
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,599
So what percentage of these folks are going to

52
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,606
make the third one?

53
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:36,977
Well, 75% of them are going to make the 3rd one.

54
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:41,837
So, 75% of them are going to make the 3rd one.

55
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:43,460
What is this going to be?

56
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,914
This is going to be

57
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:49,416
75 percent, 75 percent of this number,

58
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:56,964
of this length, which is 75% of 75%.

59
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,914
And it if you would go all the way to free throw #10,

60
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,568
and I think you see the pattern here,

61
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:05,710
(if we are going all the way to Free Throw #10), so I am just skipping a bunch,

62
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,194
we are going to get some very, very, very small fraction

63
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:11,335
that had made all ten,

64
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:15,624
is essentially going to be 75% times 75% times 75%...

65
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:20,865
10 times: 75% being multiplied repeatedly 10 times.

66
00:03:20,865 --> 00:03:23,541
So this is going to be what we have left off with,

67
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:27,024
this is going to be 75%, times 75%

68
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,779
(and let me copy and paste this)

69
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:32,876
(so it doesn't take forever.)

70
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:38,742
(So... copy, and then paste it. So times out)

71
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,150
(I will put the multiplication signs on later)

72
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:49,622
(that's four... that's six... that's eight..)

73
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:54,126
(...and then: that IS ten. Right over there,)

74
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,664
(let me throw the multiplication signs in there, so)

75
00:03:56,664 --> 00:04:00,567
(times, times, times, times...)

76
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:03,298
So this little fraction that made all ten of them

77
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:05,389
is going to be equaled to this value right over here.

78
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,877
75 of... let's see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:

79
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:13,940
75 percent being repeatedly multiplied 10 times.

80
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,188
Now, this would obviously be taken me forever

81
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,755
to do it by hand. And even on a calculator,

82
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,101
if I would have punched all of these in,

83
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:20,924
I might made mistake(s).

84
00:04:20,924 --> 00:04:24,004
But lucky for us: there is a mathematical operator

85
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:26,605
that is essentially repeated multiplications.

86
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,551
And that's taking an exponent.

87
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,914
So another way- another way of writing that,

88
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:33,136
(right over there), we could write that as:

89
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:37,313
75 percent to the... tenth power,

90
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:40,377
repeatedly multiplying 75% ten times-

91
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,292
these are the SAME expression(s).

92
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:47,013
And 75 percent, the word "per-cent",

93
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:50,698
literally means "per hundred."

94
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,832
You might recognize the root word, "cent,"

95
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,163
from things like "century,"

96
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:57,472
100 years in a century, 100 cents in a dollar,

97
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:59,218
so this literally means "per hundred."

98
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:03,594
So we could write this as "75 over 100 to the 10th power,"

99
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:09,801
which is the same thing as 0.75 to the tenth power.

100
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,074
And let's get out calculator out

101
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,127
and see what this evaluates to.

102
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:18,091
So, 0.75 to the... tenth power,

103
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,536
gets us to: .056,

104
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,559
and I'll just round to the nearest hundreds,

105
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,228
so if we'd round to the nearest hundreds,

106
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:29,555
that gets us to .06.

107
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:36,594
So this is roughly equaled to (if we round to the nearest hundreds): 0.06

108
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,134
which is equaled to, roughly when we round,

109
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,172
a 6 percent probability of

110
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,651
making ten free-throws in a row! :-)

111
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,855
Which even though you have quite a high free throw percentage,

112
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:48,047
this is not that high of a probability.

113
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,774
It's a little bit better than a one-in-twenty chance. :D

114
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:55,160
Now: what I want to throw out there for everyone else watching this,

115
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,299
is to think about how we can make a general statement about anybody,

116
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,122
if that anybody has some free throw percentages,

117
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,530
and wants to say: what's the probability of

118
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,230
making 10 in a row?

119
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,084
How can we say that?

120
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,324
Well, I think we saw the pattern right over here.

121
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:14,183
The probability... of making, let's call it "n,"

122
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,483
where "n" is the number of free-throws we care about,

123
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:21,108
n free-throws in a row,

124
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:24,224
for somebody, and we are not just talking about LeBron here,

125
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:28,265
is going to be their free throw percentage,

126
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:30,812
and this case, Lebron's is 75%,

127
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:34,078
to the number of free throws we want to get in a row.

128
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,917
So to the, n-th power.

129
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:38,396
For example: you might want to play around

130
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,696
with your own free throw percentages.

131
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,396
if your free-throw percentage is, let's say,

132
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:44,208
60 percent, which is the same thing as .6.

133
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,488
So let's say you have a 60% free-throw percentage,

134
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:47,788
and you want to see the probability of

135
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,980
getting five in a row,

136
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,125
you would take that to the fifth power.

137
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,625
And you'd get- what looks like,

138
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,525
if you round it to the nearest hundredth,

139
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,087
would be about 8%.

140
00:06:56,087 --> 00:06:57,879
So I encourage you to try this

141
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,687
with different free-throw percentages,

142
00:06:59,687 --> 00:07:01,387
and different numbers of free throws

143
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,085
that you are attempting to get in a row.
