00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The measures of two angles of an isosceles triangle

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,950
are 3x+5 degrees, we'll say, and 3x+16 degrees.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,650
Find all possible values of x.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,050
So, let's think about this,

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,150
let's draw ourselves an isosceles triangle or two

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,500
So, that's an isosceles triangle.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,060
Like that and like that.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,930
And actually let me draw a couple of them.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,350
It's because we wanna think about all of the different

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,070
possibilities here.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,700
All of the different possibilities.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,590
So, we know from, what we know about isosceles triangles

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,310
that base angles are gonna be congruent.

14
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,620
That angle is gonna be equal to be that angle,

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,040
that angle is gonna be equal to be that angle.

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,560
And so what could the 3x+5 degrees and the x+16,

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,950
what could they be measures of?

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,660
Well maybe this one right over here has a measure of 3x+5 degrees

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,180
and the vertex is the other one.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,300
So, maybe this one up here is the x+16, x+16 degrees.

21
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,300
The other possibility, the other possibility

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,450
is that this is describing both base angles.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,450
In which case they would be equal.

24
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,860
So, maybe this one is 3x+15

25
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,460
and maybe this one over here is x+16, x+16.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,090
And that is, in the final possibility,

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,950
actually we haven't exhausted all of them:

28
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,040
Is that if we swapped these two, if this one is x+16

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,970
and that one is 3x+15.

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,110
Let me draw ourselves another triangle.

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,180
Let me draw ourselves another triangle.

32
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,590
And obviously swapping these two aren't going to make a difference,

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,780
because they are equal to each other.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,060
And then we can make that one equal to 3x+5,

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,750
but that one isn't gonna change anything either.

36
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,040
because they are equal to each other.

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,870
So, the last situation where this angle, now here is x+16

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,540
and this angle up here is 3x+5.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,890
This is 3x+5.

40
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,550
So, let's just work through each of this.

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,220
So, in this situation, if this base angle is 3x+5,

42
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,710
so is this base angle.

43
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,590
Then we know all of three of these are gonna add up to 180 degrees.

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,760
So, we get 3x+5 plus 3x+5 plus x+16

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,710
is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,820
We have 3x, let's just add, you have 3x plus 3x

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,030
which gives you 6x plus another x gives you 7x.

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:30,010
And then you have 5 plus 5 which is 10 plus 16 is equal to 26.

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,020
Is equal to 26.

50
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,980
And that is gonna be equal to 180.

51
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,330
And then we have, let's see, 180 minus 26,

52
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,460
if we subtract 26 from both sides we get 180 minus 20

53
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,750
is 160 minus another 6 is 154.

54
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,940
154.

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,030
You have 7x is equal to 154

56
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,730
Let's see how many times this is, if we divide both sides by 7

57
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:07,360
7 will go to into 140 20x and get another 14.

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,030
So, it looks like 22 times so x is equal to 22, is that right?

59
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,010
20 times 7 is 140

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,400
140 plus 14 is 154.

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,520
So we have x is equal to 22 in this first 22 degrees,

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,880
in this first scenario.

63
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,480
Now let's think about this second scenario over here.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,260
Now we have, now we have

65
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,020
these two characters are gonna be equal to each other.

66
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,540
Because they're both the x angles.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,630
So, you have 3x+5 is equal to x+16.

68
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,300
You can subtract x from both sides.

69
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,040
So, this becomes 2x+5 is equal to 16.

70
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,100
We can subtract 5 from both sides and you get 2x is equal to 11.

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,480
And then you can divide both sides, you can divide both sides

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,010
by 2 and you get x is equal to 11, is equal to 11 halves.

73
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,670
So, that is our second scenario.

74
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,310
And now we do our third scenario right over here.

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,180
If this base angle is x+16 and then this base angle right over here

76
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,790
is gonna be also x+16, they're congruent.

77
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,800
Then we can do the first thing we did for the first scenario.

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,400
All of these angles are gonna have to add up to 180 degrees.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,900
So, we have x+16 plus x+16 plus 3x+5

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,910
when you add them all up together you're gonna get 180 degrees.

81
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,070
Now let's add up all the x terms.

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,450
x plus x is 2x plus 3x is 5x.

83
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,310
So we get 5x.

84
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,830
5x.

85
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,110
Then you have 16 plus 16 is 32

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,360
32 plus 5 is 37.

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,100
Plus 37 is equal to 180 degrees.

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:05,170
Subtract 37 from both sides and we get 5x is equal to,

89
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,530
So it's not gonna divide nicely.

90
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,530
Divide both sides by 5 you get x is equal 143 over 5.

91
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,510
Which you can just leave as an improper fraction.

92
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,890
You can write it as a mix number

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,350
or however else you might write it.

94
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,290
And we are done!

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:30,030
These are the 3, these are the 3 possible values of x

96
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,940
given the information they gave us right up there.
