1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,800
I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here,
and let's just say its entries

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,690
are a, b, c, and d.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,140
And it's composed of
two column vectors.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,430
We've done this before, let's
call this first column v1 and

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,440
let's call the second
column v2.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,860
So we can rewrite here.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:28,440
We can say v1 one is equal to
ac, and we could write that v2

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,890
is equal to bd.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,270
And these are both members of
r2, and just to have a nice

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,870
visualization in our head,
let's graph these two.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,170
Let me draw my axes.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,870
That's my vertical axis.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,870
That's my horizontal axis.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,240
And maybe v1 looks something
like this.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,860
v1 might look something
like that.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,040
So that is v1.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,222
It's horizontal component will
be a, its vertical coordinant

19
00:00:57,222 --> 00:01:00,870
-- give you this as maybe a
position vector, or just how

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,950
we're drawing it, is c.

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,190
And then v2, let's just say it
looks something like this.

22
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,380
Let's say that they're
not the same vector.

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,380
So v2 looks like that.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,230
v2, its horizontal coordinate
is going to b, and its

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,790
vertical coordinate
is going to be d.

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,830
Now, what we're going to concern
ourselves with in this

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,190
video is the parallelogram
generated by these two guys.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,770
What I mean by that is, imagine
that these two guys

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,480
are position vectors that are
specifying points on a

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,160
parallelogram, and then of
course the -- or not of course

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,990
but, the origin is also
another point in the

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,760
parallelogram, so what will
be the last point on the

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,970
parallelogram?

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,110
Well, you can imagine.

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,380
A parallelogram, we already have
two sides of it, so the

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,770
other two sides have
to be parallel.

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,130
So one side look like that,
parallel to v1 the way I've

38
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,700
drawn it, and the other side
will look like this.

39
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,030
That's our parallelogram.

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,410
The parallelogram generated
by v2 and v1.

41
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,700
What we're going to concern
ourselves with specifically is

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:14,150
the area of the parallelogram
generated by v1 and v2.

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,120
So how do we figure that out?

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,510
In general, if I have just any
parallelogram-- this is kind

45
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,056
of a tilted one, but if I just
have any parallelogram, let me

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,060
just draw any parallelogram
right there-- the area is just

47
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,060
equal to the base-- so
that could be the

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,060
base-- times the height.

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,945
So it's equal to base -- I'll
write capital B since we have

50
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:38,210
a lowercase b there--
base times height.

51
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,560
That's what the area of a
parallelogram would be.

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Now what are the base and the
height in this situation?

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,640
Let me write this down.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,850
The area of our parallelogram
is equal to the

55
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,310
base times the height.

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,250
And actually-- well, let
me just write it here.

57
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,010
So what is the base here?

58
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,380
The base here is going to be
the length of our vector v.

59
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,730
So this is our base.

60
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,020
So this right here is going to
be the length of vector v1,

61
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,470
the length of this orange
vector right here.

62
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,340
And what's the height of this
parallelogram going to be?

63
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,660
We could drop a perpendicular
here, and that, the length of

64
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,086
this line right here, is
going to be our height.

65
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,710
   

66
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,240
So how can we figure out that,
you know, we know what v1 is,

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,010
so we can figure out the
base pretty easily.

68
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,490
But how can we figure
out the height?

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,110
Well, one thing we can do is, if
we can figure out this guy

70
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,580
right here, we could use the
Pythagorean theorem.

71
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,110
Because the length of this
vector squared, plus H

72
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,130
squared, is going to be equal
to the length of v2 squared.

73
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,960
So let's see if we
can do that.

74
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
What is this guy?

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,510
What is this green
guy right here?

76
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,160
Well if you imagine a line--
let's imagine some line l.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,410
So let's say l is a line
spanned by v1.

78
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,390
   

79
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,279
Which means you take all of the
multiples of v1, and all

80
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,580
of the positions that they
specify will create a set of

81
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,345
points, and that is my line l.

82
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,530
So you take all the multiples
of v1, you're going to get

83
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,835
every point along this line.

84
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,950
Just like that.

85
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,714
Now if we have l defined that
way-- that line right there is

86
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:36,610
l, I don't know if
you can see it.

87
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,680
Let me do it a little bit better
-- and it goes through

88
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,560
v1 and it just keeps
going over there.

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,840
What is this green
line right there?

90
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,450
This green line that we're
concerned with, that's the

91
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,080
projection onto l of what?

92
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,830
Well, we have a perpendicular
here, you can imagine the

93
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,060
light source coming down-- I
don't know if that analogy

94
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,540
helps you-- but it's kind
of the shadow of

95
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,850
v2 onto that line.

96
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,490
So it's a projection of v2, of
your vector v2 onto l is this

97
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,360
green line right there.

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,010
So, if we want to figure out
H, we can just use the

99
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,550
Pythagorean theorem.

100
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,830
So we can say that the length
of H squared-- well I'm just

101
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,370
writing H as the length,
I'm not even

102
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,040
specifying it as a vector.

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,560
So we could say that H squared,
where that is the

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,550
length of this line, plus the
length of this vector

105
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,130
squared-- and the length of
that vector squared is the

106
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,010
length of the projection
onto l of v2.

107
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,130
I'll do that in a
different color.

108
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:48,720
So the length of the projection
onto l of v2

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,870
squared-- all right?

110
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,530
We're just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.

111
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,870
This squared plus this
squared is going

112
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,320
to equal that squared.

113
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,930
It's going to be equal to the
length of v2 squared.

114
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,410
That's just the Pythagorean
theorem.

115
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,670
   

116
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,550
Nothing fancy there.

117
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,740
So how can we simplify?

118
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,470
We want to solve for H.

119
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,230
And actually, let's just solve
for H squared for now because

120
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,200
it'll keep things a little
bit simpler.

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,160
So we can say that H squared is
equal to this guy, is equal

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,400
to the length of my vector v2
squared minus the length of

123
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,390
the projection squared.

124
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,740
So minus -- I'll do that in
purple -- minus the length of

125
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,410
the projection onto
l of v2 squared.

126
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,750
Remember, this thing is just
this thing right here, we're

127
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,860
just doing the Pythagorean
theorem.

128
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,680
So let's see if we can simplify
this, or write it in

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,700
terms that we understand.

130
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,620
So the length of a vector
squared, this is just equal

131
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,390
to-- let me write it this
way-- this is just

132
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,630
equal to v2 dot v2.

133
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,880
You take a vector, you dot it
with itself, and you get the

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,550
length of that vector
squared, we saw that

135
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,370
many, many videos ago.

136
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,710
And then what is this guy
going to be equal to?

137
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,410
Well, the projection--
I'll do it over here.

138
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,700
The projection onto l of v2 is
going to be equal to v2 dot

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,580
the spanning vector,
which is v1.

140
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:31,200
So it's v2 dot v1 over the
spanning vector dotted with

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,810
itself, v1 dot v1.

142
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,370
We saw this several videos
ago when we learned about

143
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,380
projections.

144
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,510
And this is just a number
right there.

145
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,860
And then it's going
to be times the

146
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,960
spanning vector itself.

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,400
So times v1.

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,390
That is what the
projection is.

149
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,000
So it's going to be this
minus the length of

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,440
the projection squared.

151
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,100
What is the length of the
projection squared?

152
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,080
Well that's this guy dotted
with himself.

153
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,970
Let me write it this way, let
me take it step by step.

154
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,240
So this is going to be minus--
I'm want to make sure I can

155
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,250
still see that up there so I
don't have to rewrite it.

156
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,110
The projection is going to be,
it looks a little complicated

157
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,020
but hopefully things will
simplify, v2 dot v1 over v1

158
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,250
dot v1 times-- switch colors--
times the vector-- this is all

159
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,370
just going to end up being a
number, remember you take dot

160
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,050
products, you get numbers--
times the vector v1.

161
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,570
And we're going to take
the length of

162
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,039
that whole thing squared.

163
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,670
And all of this is going to
be equal to H squared.

164
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,300
Once again, just the Pythagorean
Theorem.

165
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,820
This or this squared, which is
the height squared, is equal

166
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,490
to your hypotenuse squared,
this is your hypotenuse

167
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,280
squared, minus the other
side squared.

168
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,640
This is the other
side squared.

169
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,770
Looks a little complicated, but
it was just a projection

170
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,800
of this guy on to that
right there.

171
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,840
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

172
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,410
We're just going to have to
break out some algebra or let

173
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,390
s can do here.

174
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,470
Well actually, not algebra,
some linear algebra.

175
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,060
So what is this guy?

176
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,930
Well this guy is just the dot
product of this with itself.

177
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,610
So this is just equal to-- we
know, I mean any vector, if

178
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,830
you take the square of its
length, it's just that vector

179
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,660
dotted with itself.

180
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,290
So this thing, if we are taking
the square of this

181
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,550
guy's length, it's just
equal to this

182
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,570
guy dotted with himself.

183
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,950
Let me write everything
over again.

184
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:45,210
So we get H squared is equal to
v2 dot v2, and then minus

185
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,900
this guy dotted with himself.

186
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:58,790
So minus v2 dot v1 over v1 dot
v1, times the vector v1,

187
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,000
dotted with itself.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,420
Dotted with v2 dot v1--
remember, this green part is

189
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:15,000
just a number-- over
v1 dot v1 times v1.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,063
And what is this equal to?

191
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,810
Let's just simplify this.

192
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,370
These are just scalar
quantities, and we saw that

193
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,110
the dot product is associative
with respect to scalar

194
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,190
quantities, so we can just
change the order here.

195
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,640
So this is going to be
equal to the scalar

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,750
quantity times itself.

197
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:36,110
So we could say this is
equal to v2 dot v1.

198
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,260
Let me write it this way.

199
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,000
V2 dot v1, that's going to
be-- and we're going to

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,660
multiply the numerator times
itself, v2 dot v1.

201
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:53,240
And then all of that over v1
dot v1 times v1 dot v1.

202
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,690
Remember, I'm just taking
these two terms and

203
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,290
multiplying them
by each other.

204
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,460
I'm just switching the order,
and then we know that the

205
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,690
scalars can be taken out,
times these two

206
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,750
guys dot each other.

207
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,470
Times v1 dot v1.

208
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,000
That's what this
simplifies to.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,830
Now this is now a number.

210
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,000
We had vectors here, but when
you take a dot product, you

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,650
just get a number.

212
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,180
And this number is the
same as this number.

213
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,780
So we can simplify
a little bit.

214
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,270
So we can cross those two guys
out, and then we are left with

215
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,850
that our height squared
is equal to this

216
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,960
expression times itself.

217
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,930
We have it times itself twice,
so it's equal to-- let me

218
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,680
start over here.

219
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:45,630
It's equal to v2 dot v2 minus
this guy times itself.

220
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:53,790
So v2 dot v1 squared, all of
that over just one of these

221
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:59,370
guys. v1 dot v1.

222
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,650
That is what the height
squared is.

223
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,480
Now we have the height squared,
we could take the

224
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,670
square root if we just want
to solve for the height.

225
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,350
But to keep our math simple, we
know that area is equal to

226
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,080
base times height.

227
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,660
Let's just say what the area
squared is equal to.

228
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,410
Because then both of these
terms will get squared.

229
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,024
So if the area is equal to base
times height-- we saw

230
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:24,970
that at the beginning of the
video-- then the area squared

231
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,780
is going to be equal to these
two guys squared.

232
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,640
It's going to be equal to base
squared times height squared.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Now what is the base squared?

234
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,990
Let me do it like this.

235
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,900
So the base squared-- we already
saw, the base of our

236
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:49,590
parallelogram is the length
of vector v1.

237
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,830
Now what is the base squared?

238
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,580
The base squared is going
to be the length

239
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,030
of vector v1 squared.

240
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:03,730
Or another way of writing
that is v1 dot v1.

241
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,300
And we already know what the
height squared is, it's this

242
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,520
expression right there.

243
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,780
Let me write that down.

244
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,550
The height squared is the height
squared right there.

245
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,890
So what is our area squared
going to be?

246
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,290
Our area squared-- let me go
down here where I'll have more

247
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,610
space-- our area squared is
going to be equal to our base

248
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,865
squared, which is v1 dot v1
times our height squared.

249
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:33,750
   

250
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,275
Let with me write
it like this.

251
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,780
   

252
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,170
No, I was using the
wrong color.

253
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:52,900
Times this guy over here. v2 dot
v2 minus v2 dot v1 squared

254
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,830
over v1 dot v1.

255
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,230
Now what does this
simplified to?

256
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,670
Well, this is just a number,
these are all just numbers.

257
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,310
So if I multiply, if I
distribute this out, this is

258
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,590
equal to what?

259
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,340
This times this is equal to v1--
let me color code it-- v1

260
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:22,100
dot v1 times this guy
times v2 dot v2.

261
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,680
And then when I multiplied
this guy times

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,010
that guy, what happens?

263
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,660
Well I have this guy in the
numerator and that guy in the

264
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,010
denominator, so they
cancel out.

265
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:37,700
So I'm just left with minus
v2 dot v1 squared.

266
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,650
Now let's remind ourselves what
these two vectors were.

267
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,650
v1 was the vector ac and
v2 is the vector bd.

268
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,110
Let me rewrite it down here so
we have it to work with.

269
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:54,760
So v1 was equal to the vector
ac, and v2 is equal

270
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,600
to the vector bd.

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,790
So what is v1 dot v1?

272
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,320
   

273
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,750
That is equal to a dot
a, a times a, a

274
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,020
squared plus c squared.

275
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,990
That's this, right there.

276
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,800
And that's what? v2 dot v2.

277
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,740
So we're going to have
that times v2 dot v2.

278
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,030
v2 dot v2 is c squared
plus d squared.

279
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,450
And then we're going to have
minus v2 dot v1 squared.

280
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,080
So what's v2 dot v1?

281
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,590
It's b times a, plus d times c,
or a times b plus -- we're

282
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,850
just dotting these two guys.

283
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:46,600
So it's ab plus cd, and then
we're squaring it.

284
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,910
And let's see what this
simplifies to.

285
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,630
Hopefully it simplifies
to something.

286
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,050
Let me switch colors.

287
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,550
So if we just multiply this
out, let me write it here.

288
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,185
Our area squared is equal to
a squared times b squared.

289
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,930
   

290
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:08,150
a squared times d squared,
plus c squared times b

291
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:13,670
squared, plus c squared
times d squared.

292
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,350
   

293
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,220
And then minus this
guy squared.

294
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,960
What is that going
to be equal to?

295
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,620
ab squared is a squared,
b squared.

296
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,650
And then I'm going to multiply
these guys times each other

297
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,750
twice, so that's going
to be plus 2abcd.

298
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,020
And then you're going to have
a plus c squared, d squared.

299
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,260
I just foiled this out, that's
the best way you

300
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,010
could think about it.

301
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,920
And then, if I distribute this
negative sign, what do I have?

302
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,230
Let me rewrite everything.

303
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,380
It's equal to a squared b
squared, plus a squared d

304
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,100
squared, plus c squared b
squared, plus c squared d

305
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:08,060
squared, minus a squared b
squared, minus 2abcd, minus c

306
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,200
squared, d squared.

307
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,920
All I did is, I distributed
the minus sign.

308
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,960
Now it looks like some things
will simplify nicely.

309
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,550
And now remember, all this is
equal to our area squared.

310
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,180
We have a ab squared, we have
a minus ab squared.

311
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,589
They cancel out.

312
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,130
We have a minus cd squared
and a cd squared,

313
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,650
so they cancel out.

314
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,100
So all we're left with is that
the area of our parallelogram

315
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:45,490
squared is equal to a squared
d squared minus 2abcd plus c

316
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,740
squared b squared.

317
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,920
   

318
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,910
Now this might look a little bit
bizarre to you, but if you

319
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,210
made a substitution right here,
if you said that x is

320
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,540
equal to ad, and if you said y
is equal to cb, then what does

321
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,730
this become?

322
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,220
This is equal to x
squared minus 2

323
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,180
times xy plus y squared.

324
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,750
Right?

325
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,740
Hopefully you recognize this.

326
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,610
And this is just the same thing
as x minus y squared.

327
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,580
So, if this is our substitutions
we made-- I did

328
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,940
this just so you can visualize
this a little bit better.

329
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,980
So we have our area squared is
equal to x minus y squared or

330
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:39,640
ad minus cb, or let me
write it, bc squared.

331
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,960
That's what the area of our
parallelogram squared is.

332
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,540
And if you don't quite
understand what I did here, I

333
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,890
just made these substitutions
so you can

334
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,080
recognize it better.

335
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,010
But just understand that this
is the same thing as this.

336
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,100
If you want, you can just
multiply this guy out and

337
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,670
you'll get that right there.

338
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,650
But what is this?

339
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,700
What is this thing right here?

340
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,250
It's the determinant.

341
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,470
This is the determinant of
our original matrix.

342
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,380
   

343
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,710
Well, I called that matrix A
and then I used A again for

344
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,460
area, so let me write
it this way.

345
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,880
Area squared -- let me
write it like this.

346
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,870
Area squared is equal to
ad minus bc squared.

347
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,940
So this is area, these
A's are all area.

348
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:32,940
But what is this?

349
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,770
This is the determinant
of my matrix.

350
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:43,050
That is the determinant of my
matrix A, my original matrix

351
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,680
that I started the problem with,
which is equal to the

352
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,380
determinant of abcd.

353
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,870
Right?

354
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,340
The determinant of this is ad
minus bc, by definition.

355
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,190
So your area-- this
is exciting!

356
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,140
So the area of your
parallelogram squared is equal

357
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,070
to the determinant of the matrix
whose column vectors

358
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,210
construct that parallelogram.

359
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,650
Is equal to the determinant
of your matrix squared.

360
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,690
Or if you take the square root
of both sides, you get the

361
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,980
area is equal to the absolute
value of the determinant of A.

362
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,030
Which is a pretty neat
outcome, especially

363
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,732
considering how much hairy
algebra we had to go through.

364
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:28,720
Let's go back all the way over
here, go back to the drawing.

365
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,740
So if we want to figure out the
area of this parallelogram

366
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,610
right here, that is defined, or
that is created, by the two

367
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,620
column vectors of a matrix, we
literally just have to find

368
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,460
the determinant of the matrix.

369
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,620
The area of this is equal to
the absolute value of the

370
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,630
determinant of A.

371
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,060
And you have to do that because

372
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,930
this might be negative.

373
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,830
You can imagine if you swapped
these guys around, if you

374
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,150
swapped some of the rows, this
guy would be negative, but you

375
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,230
can 't have a negative area.

376
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,560
And it wouldn't really change
the definition, it really

377
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,730
wouldn't change what spanned.

378
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,960
If you switched v1 and v2,
you're still spanning the same

379
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,470
parallelogram, you just might
get the negative of the

380
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,770
determinant.

381
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,640
But that is a really
neat outcome.

382
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,240
And you know, when you first
learned determinants in

383
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,000
school-- I mean, we learned
the first motivation for a

384
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,640
determinant was this idea of
when we take the inverse of a

385
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,110
2 by 2, this thing shows up in
the denominator and we call

386
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,180
that the determinant.

387
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,470
But now there's this other
interpretation here.

388
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,590
There's actually the area of the
parallelogram created by

389
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,360
the column vectors
of this matrix.

390
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,400
