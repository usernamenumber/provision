1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,208
Now that we've done a series of videos on America's interventions during the Cold War

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:12,106
in Korea---Korea and Cuba and Vietnam, I thought it would be fun

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,939
to just think a little bit of the patterns here

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,404
and just as in all of these History videos

5
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:20,444
you have to take anything I say, or really

6
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,362
anything anyone says about History with a grain of salt

7
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,047
even when it comes to the facts

8
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,688
obviously the facts can only be written by the people

9
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:30,176
who survive, who knows what might have gone on

10
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,508
behind the scenes that never got documented by historians

11
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,590
so you have to take everything with a grain of salt. And even when

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,131
you know, in this video, I'll talk about maybe some patterns

13
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:40,939
some themes that I have seen

14
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,942
don't take that as just the truth

15
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,822
think about it for yourself. If it makes sense, it makes sense

16
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:48,111
and if doesn't, try to look into it more

17
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:52,217
and try to come up wth your own themes or your patterns or things that you can learn from

18
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:54,552
So the general pattern across all of these is that

19
00:00:54,552 --> 00:01:02,120
before the US got involved and before a kind of a-- a Communist-leaning regime got involved

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,805
these were all in some ways subjugated populations.

21
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:10,519
In Korea, it was subjugated by the Japanese

22
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,111
It was the Japanese colony.

23
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:16,648
In Cuba, it was subjugated by the Batista government.

24
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:20,689
And this was a dictatorship, a corrupt dictatorship and it was

25
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,212
heavily influenced by the United States. You could almost view it

26
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:27,113
as United States influence--a United States colony. They had so much

27
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:29,013
influence with Batista.

28
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:31,097
And in the case of Vietnam, it was a

29
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,697
French colony. So you can imagine in all

30
00:01:34,697 --> 00:01:38,150
of these situations, the existing rulers were not that popular.

31
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,001
People were looking for rulers who could

32
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,744
kind of liberate them from the messes they were inside of that.

33
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,117
On top of that, and this comes to the whole

34
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:49,032
discussion of Capitalism versus Communism

35
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:51,000
you can imagine that when you are colonized

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,116
or when you are in a corrupt regime, you do have people

37
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:58,769
accruing wealth. So there are people accruing wealth. Some

38
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,639
of whom who get it without

39
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:03,414
without being kind of that legitimate.

40
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,711
And so these circles are kind of the size of different people's wealth

41
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:11,898
So you can imagine, in Korea under Japanese rule, maybe there were a few people

42
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,389
who were successful by being legitimate entrepreneurs.

43
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:16,412
But there were probably a whole bunch of people

44
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:19,342
who were successful by just...kind of...sucking up to

45
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:22,268
the colonial powers. In the case of a corrupt regime,

46
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:26,045
doing things that were corrupt with the regime, using

47
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,831
the regime to get undue power in a certain market,

48
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,485
And it's always a combination.

49
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,169
In any of these countries, there were probably

50
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:36,494
some entrepreneurs and some other people and some others who got wealth

51
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,854
with good means and then some other people who, under these regimes

52
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:43,537
who got wealth under questionable means. Maybe because

53
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,514
they sucked up to the corrupt regime

54
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,995
or maybe they even did outright criminal activity

55
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,957
which was probably the case of the Batista regime

56
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:52,980
probably they did have people who were outright criminals

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,952
doing very well for themselves. Same thing in Vietnam,

58
00:02:55,952 --> 00:03:00,504
maybe the Vietnamese, some of the Vietnamese, who really kind of

59
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:05,597
were aligned with the French probably got extra favors, so their wealth wasn't necessarily

60
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:08,027
due to innovation or competence.

61
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,096
But really just were they fitted into the political order.

62
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:13,785
Maybe some other people did have legitimate wealth

63
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,999
So you imagine when any of these types of

64
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,894
situations start to emerge, from subjugation

65
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:22,052
So, you start having independence movements

66
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:27,717
In all of these situations. You can imagine it's a very

67
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:31,571
popular notion to run on, and depending on how true it is

68
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,033
but its a very popular notion to run on, to tell people look

69
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:37,129
"You've seen all of these people who've gotten

70
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,722
questionable wealth and maybe some of these

71
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:41,621
people who got questionable wealth got it by

72
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,474
being aligned with our subjugators

73
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,267
By being, to some degree, traitors

74
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,813
to our people. And once again,

75
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:50,411
maybe not all of the people, but you can see how it's a popular line

76
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,872
for someone coming to power when you're

77
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:54,618
emerging from independent...or when you're

78
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:57,516
emerging into independence, to say, "Why don't we redistribute wealth?"

79
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,844
"Why don't we take the wealth from this person from right here who

80
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:04,799
got it in questionable means, and redistribute it, and

81
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,028
redistribute it to the rest of the society?

82
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:11,936
Why don't we take it from this person over here, and redistribute it to the rest of society?"

83
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:16,394
"Why don't we do that with this person here, and redistribute that wealth to the rest of society?"

84
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:22,278
And, if you're looking for a political ideology that seems to

85
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:26,580
fit with this idea of trying to correct things that

86
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,495
maybe looked wrong during the

87
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:30,806
colonial or subjugated rule, Communism

88
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,927
seems to fit that. It's kind of a

89
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,760
redistributing of wealth, or maybe the state

90
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,057
takes over all wealth. Or maybe something in between where it's Socialist

91
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:41,348
where the state is redistributing wealth fairly aggressively

92
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:45,853
but you still have kind of underpinings of Capitalism

93
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,927
And so you can imagine that Communism

94
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:54,397
especially to a population that---where you have many many many poor people

95
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:57,137
wealth concentrated in a few people, many of whom are

96
00:04:57,137 --> 00:05:00,063
aligned with the older regimes, Communism at least seems

97
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:03,020
like a popular notion. And you have people

98
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,177
who ride this Nationalistic, Communistic feeling

99
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:10,050
and in the case of Cuba, you have people like

100
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,299
Fidel Castro, people like Fidel Castro.

101
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:19,518
In Vietnam, you have people like Ho Chi Minh

102
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,612
And then Korea's a little bit different because

103
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,032
you did have a Communist, Nationalist independence movement, but

104
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:29,444
Kim Il Sung wasn't necessarily the leader of that movement

105
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,905
the Soviets didn't actually want any of those people in charge

106
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:35,699
any of the kind of the Natonalist Communist the leaders of those

107
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,469
movement, they kind of marginalized them and installed Kim Il Sung

108
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:44,669
probably because he was more aligned with them, but he was Communist

109
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,961
Now the reality is, these guys

110
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:50,195
come in under these very egalitarian, you know, equality for all

111
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:53,771
let's get retribution for the wrongs that were done to us before

112
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,781
But probably all of them start to not just redistribute wealth from people who

113
00:05:57,781 --> 00:05:59,850
might have gotten it in bad ways, but they're also

114
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,812
just redistributing wealth generally

115
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,545
Maybe because it's just a popular thing to do

116
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:07,409
Or maybe because these people didn't give them proper support

117
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,443
So they're getting retribution on their political enemies, and

118
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:15,830
as opposed to just kind of doing it for social good

119
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,089
So you know they might do it from people who have

120
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,989
legitimate wealth and so those people aren't

121
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:21,412
too happy about it. And

122
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:24,902
they ride kind of this Communistic, egalitarian movement

123
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,323
to install themselves and, instead of being a purely Marxist state

124
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,350
they kind of want to be more Marxist-Leninist

125
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,896
where you have this Communist party that has

126
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,596
this continuous revolution, which

127
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:39,034
is a justification for them to never hold real elections, and always stay in power

128
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:42,440
So, by no means is this kind of a rationale why these people

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,589
are legitimate. But what happened in every one of these cases

130
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,499
is that the United States was in the middle of the Cold War

131
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,914
They feared the spread of Communism.

132
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:55,397
Communism tended to correlate with non-free state.

133
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:59,251
It doesn't have to be that way. But every time Communism was implemented, it also

134
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:03,308
was these kind of authoritarian rule, no democracy. And you can also

135
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,055
imagine there were many capitalists in the United States who

136
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,663
for their own selfish reasons, were afraid of [Communism] spreading to the United States

137
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:10,907
because maybe their wealth would be redistributed.

138
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:14,607
But regardless of what the justification, whether it was a more noble

139
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:17,394
wanting people to have freedom of expression

140
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:21,188
freedom to hold property, or whether they were selfish

141
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,221
"Hey we don't want our own wealth to be somehow taken away."

142
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:27,517
Or it just might have been a balance of power between the US

143
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:30,815
and the Soviet Union, that every time a country fell to Communism

144
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,684
that somehow, the US was losing some power in the world.

145
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,130
Regardless of the US's rationale, they always say,

146
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,372
"OK, These guys are Communist, we're gonna take the other side of the equation

147
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:46,087
So the US ends up supporting

148
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:49,669
Sig Muh Ree in South Korea

149
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,535
whom we know was not the best character in the world.

150
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:56,853
They end up supporting Diem in South Vietnam

151
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:01,358
whom we also know was not the necessary the most savory person in the world.

152
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:04,049
In the case of Cuba, the US at least

153
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,110
they did support Batista while he was in power

154
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,425
but we saw in that video

155
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:10,056
Kennedy came on later saying, you know, Batista was pretty bad

156
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,972
dude, and it was probably a big mistake for the US to

157
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,302
support him. But the US goes on

158
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:16,233
the other side and they support the exiles against Fidel Castro

159
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:23,834
And here the Cuban exiles, they're not in the category of Sig Muh Ree or Diem

160
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:26,636
they probably favor democracy and overall

161
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,121
good people but what they probably

162
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:31,093
did feed Kennedy is a story that Fidel Castro

163
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,516
wasn't as popular as he actually was

164
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:35,785
And he probably was more popular

165
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,531
especially after the Revolution

166
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:41,204
because he had this egalitarian, people were getting over the Batistas

167
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:43,416
kind of anybody but Batista they would be happy about

168
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,759
Fidel Castro was this charismatic leader who kind of

169
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,442
working for the poor, at least it looked like he was working for the poor

170
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:54,299
So at least in the get-go

171
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,450
especially the Kennedy administration might have been fed

172
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,089
an overly optimistic view that kind of got them

173
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,459
involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion and all of that

174
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,975
But this is just the general pattern that happened every time

175
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,458
And every time, it ended up in either a US defeat

176
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,466
or a stalemate, and you know

177
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,777
Take whatever lessons there are from this

178
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:14,120
but it is kind of an interesting pattern that happened multiple times

179
00:09:14,120 --> 99:59:59,999
pretty much every engagement that we had during the Cold War.
