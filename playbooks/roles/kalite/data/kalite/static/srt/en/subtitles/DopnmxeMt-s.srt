00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:04,518
Welcome to Level 2 Linear Equations! Let's do a problem.

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:14,176
2X plus 3 is equal to minus 15.

3
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:16,672
I took a minus is there to make it a little bit tougher.

4
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:20,704
So the first thing we wanna do whenever we do any linear equations ,

5
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:26,301
we want to get all of the variable terms on one hand side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side

6
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:30,484
It doesn't really matter, although, I intend to get my variables on the left hand side of the equation.

7
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:35,742
Well, the only thing that my variables are already on the left hand side of the equation,

8
00:00:35,742 --> 00:00:40,127
but have this plus three, that I somehow wanna move to the right hand side of the equation.

9
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:44,477
And the way I can "move" the 3 is,

10
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,107
I could subtract 3 from the both sides of the equation,

11
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:51,338
and look at that carefully as to why you think that works.

12
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:59,139
Because if I subtract 3 from the left side, clearly, this negative 3 that I am subtracting, the original 3 will cancel out and becomes zero.

13
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:04,388
And as long as I do whatever I do on the left hand side as long as I do on the right hand side as well, because,

14
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:08,870
whatever you do on one hand side, equal side, you have to

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,260
do to the other, then I'm making a valid operation.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:20,773
So this would simplify to 2 X, cause 3 is cancelled out, and comes zero, equals minus 15, minus 3

17
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:24,870
Well, that's minus 18.

18
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,449
And now we're just on the level 2 to level 1 problem

19
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:36,256
And you could just multiply both sides of this equation times their reciprocal on the coefficient of 2 X.

20
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,127
Some people would just say that we're dividing by 2, which is essentially, what we're doing.

21
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:46,137
I like to always go to the reciprocal, because if these 2 was a fraction, it's easier to think about that way.

22
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:51,981
But either way, you either multiply it by the reciprocal or divide by the number.

23
00:01:52,027 --> 00:02:00,245
1/2 times 2 x is just 1 x, so you get x equals minus 18 over 2

24
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:05,598
minus 18 over 2 is just equal to minus 9.

25
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:07,423
Let's do another problem.

26
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:11,945
And actually, if we wanna check it we could say that the original problem was

27
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:17,125
2x plus 3 equals minus 15.

28
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:21,989
We could say 2 times minus 9 plus 3.

29
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,797
2 times minus 9 is minus 18 plus 3.

30
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:29,556
Well, that is equal to minus 15.

31
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:31,775
which is equal to what the original equation said.

32
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,740
So we know it's right!

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,599
That the neat thing about algebra, you can always check that your work.

34
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,047
Let's do another problem.

35
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:43,624
I'm gonna put some fractions in this time just to show you that it can get a little bit hairy.

36
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:57,144
So, let's say I had minus 1/2 x plus 3/4 is equal to 5/6

37
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,727
So we will do the same thing.

38
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:02,545
First we just wanna get the 3/4 out of the left hand side of the equation.

39
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:09,525
Actually if you wanna try to work this out yourself, you could pause the video now.

40
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,045
Let's go ahead.

41
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:23,208
if we wanna get rid og the 3/4, all we do is subtarct 3/4 from both sides

42
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,217
On the left hand side the 3/4 just cancel out,

43
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:32,358
and we get minus 1/2 x equal.

44
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:38,165
On the right hand side we have do the fraction subtraction.

45
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:44,123
the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12.

46
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:53,559
that becomes 10 minus 9.

47
00:03:53,559 --> 00:04:02,162
We get minus 1/2 x is equal to 1/12.

48
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:04,448
I hope I did not make a mistake.

49
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:09,593
If that step confuse you -- I went a little fast -- you might just want to review the addition and subtraction of fraction.

50
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:12,111
Going back to where we were.

51
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:16,197
now all we have to do is the coefficient on the x term is minus 1/2,

52
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,012
and this is now a level 1 problem,

53
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:23,293
so to solve for x we just multiply x by the reciprocal of minus 1/2 x.

54
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:30,398
That is minus 2 over 1, on both sides.

55
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:40,202
The left hand side simplifies to x.

56
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:45,297
The right hand side becomes minus 2 over 12,

57
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:50,631
and we can simplify that to minus 1/6.

58
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:55,897
Let's just check that to make sure that we got it right.

59
00:04:55,897 --> 00:05:01,059
We got minus 1/6 and the original problem was

60
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:07,301
minus 1/2 x, so we substitute minus 1/6,

61
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:12,262
plus 3/4. I only wrote the left hand side of the original problem.

62
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:22,731
So minus 1/2 times minus 1/6 that is positive 1/12 and then plus 3/4.

63
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:33,528
That is the same thing as 1/12 plus 9/12. 1 plus 9 is 10 over 12.

64
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:38,535
That is equal to 5/6 which is what our orignal problem was.

65
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:41,161
This other stuff was what I wroter later

66
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,327
So the problem checks out.

67
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:47,849
Hopefully you are now ready to try some level 2 problem on your own.

68
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,129
I might add some more example problems.

69
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,917
The only extra step here relative to level 1 problems is

70
00:05:54,917 --> 00:06:00,580
that we have this constant term that you need to add or subtract from both sides of this equation,

71
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,568
and you essentially turn it into a level 1 problem.

72
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,400
Have fun!
