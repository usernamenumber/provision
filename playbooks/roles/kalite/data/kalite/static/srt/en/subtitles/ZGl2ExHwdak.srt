1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,240
Simplify 16x plus 14 minus
this entire quantity 3x

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,680
squared plus x minus 9.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,910
So let me just rewrite it and
I'll get rid of some of the

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,906
parentheses if we can.

6
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:13,360
So we have this 16x
right here.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,170
16x plus 14.

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,110
we don't have to have those
parentheses, it doesn't change

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,630
the order of operations.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,080
And then we can subtract
from that.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,150
Well, we can just distribute
this negative sign.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,020
So instead of having a positive
3x squared, if we

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,390
multiply it times
this negative 1,

14
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,240
it is minus 3x squared.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,530
That's that term right
over there.

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,860
And then you have this
x over here.

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,490
It's a positive x, but it's
being multiplied by this

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,510
negative 1 out here.

19
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,900
So it is minus x.

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,600
And then finally, you have this
negative 9 out here, but

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,290
it's being multiplied by a
negative 1 out in front of the

22
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,530
parentheses, so a
negative times a

23
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,040
negative is a positive.

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,750
So plus 9.

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,930
And so now we can just combine
terms that have the same

26
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,460
degree of x in them.

27
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,180
And I'll start with the
highest degree term.

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,580
The highest degree
term right here.

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,510
And the degree just
means x raised

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,030
to the highest exponent.

31
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,670
The highest degree term here
is negative 3x squared.

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,600
It's the second degree term.

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,930
x is being raised to
the second power.

34
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,650
So I'll just write here,
negative 3x squared.

35
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,130
It's the only when we have.

36
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,550
Then we have the x terms.
We have 16x minus x.

37
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,200
So if you have 16 of something
and you subtract 1 away from

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,180
it, you're going to have 15x.

39
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,090
So plus 15x.

40
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,000
And then finally, you have your
constant terms. 14 and

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
then you have plus 9.

42
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,870
So 14 plus 9 is 23.

43
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,480
Plus 23.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,200
And we are all done.

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,380
We've simplified
the polynomial.

46
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,066
