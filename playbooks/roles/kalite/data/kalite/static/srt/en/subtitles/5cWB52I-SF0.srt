1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,170
In this first, what I'll call
this is my first real linear

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,250
algebra video, I want to
introduce you to some concepts

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,660
that you're going to see over
and over in linear algebra,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,280
and if they're not introduced
to you properly in the

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,980
beginning, they can
be very confusing.

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,930
But hopefully over the course
of this video, you'll

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,400
understand that they're pretty
straightforward ideas.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,490
If anything, in linear algebra,
the field, or the

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,830
gods of linear algebra, are
kind of experts in to some

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,950
degree stating simple and
obvious things in convoluted

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,050
and Byzantine ways.

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,700
But it does that for a
reason; it gives it

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,620
mathematical rigor.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,330
So the first thing I want to
introduce you to is the set

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,400
notation for real numbers and
then multiple dimensions of

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,070
real numbers.

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,820
So if you ever see this, an R
with an extra backbone like

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,220
that, or sometimes it's written
as just a really

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,040
bold-faced R if it's maybe
typed in a book, a really

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:08,810
bold-faced R, this just means,
the set of all real numbers.

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,510
And I probably should make a
few videos where I classify

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:16,380
numbers by reals and complex
and irrational and rational

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,410
and whatever else, and there's
actually very formal ways of

25
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,250
defining the set of all real
numbers, but the simple thing

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,460
for me is all numbers
except complex ones.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,300
So this is the same thing as

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:35,840
everything but complex numbers.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,730
So pi is a real number, e is a
real number, square root of 2

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,250
is a real number, 3 is a real
number, minus 3 is a real

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,630
number, minus pi is a real
number, But 1 plus 2i is not a

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,560
real number.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,120
It's not in the set of reals;
that's a complex number.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,460
So everything but complex.

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,230
So pretty much all regular
numbers that you ever dealt

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,360
with before you learned
what i was.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,540
That's the set of
real numbers.

38
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,660
Now, the next thing you'll see
when you start discussing

39
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,090
linear algebra is someone will
write-- they won't just write

40
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:17,350
the set of all real numbers,
they'll write Rn.

41
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,570
And you're like, gee,
what is that?

42
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,000
Are they somehow taking
the exponent of

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,460
all of the real numbers?

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,100
And actually on some level, that
is what they're doing,

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,710
but what they're saying here is
they're taking the set of

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,900
all ordered sets of
real numbers.

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,550
So what do I mean by that?

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,190
So let me do an example where
I don't just have Rn,

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:45,310
So R2 is the set of all lists
of real numbers, and let me

50
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,440
make one of the lists.

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,020
So let's say this has
one number and then

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,810
it has another number.

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,330
So it's the set of -- let me
write it this way, so I can

54
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,460
write in the set of notations.

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,110
It's the set of all-- we could
call these tuples.

56
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:07,310
Sometimes it's called a 2-tuple,
which just means a

57
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,370
list of two numbers.

58
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,180
That's all it means.

59
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,920
It just means a list
of two numbers.

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,760
So R2 is a list of all ordered
2-tuples, so all ordered lists

61
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,340
of two numbers.

62
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,350
Let me actually write down the
word ordered because that's

63
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:25,010
important, so ordered
list of 2-tuples.

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,760
So, for example, this would
be-- well, let me

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,460
write it this way.

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,870
This would be a different-- when
I say ordered, I'm saying

67
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,690
that this is fundamentally
different than that, that

68
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,240
these aren't the same 2-tuple.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,010
Each of these is a 2-tuple,
but R2 is a set of all

70
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,730
2-tuples such that-- that line
there just means such that or

71
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:58,825
maybe for which-- each of
the numbers-- and I'll

72
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,280
write it this way.

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,250
I could just write-- well, I
could write it a couple of

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,480
ways, but I'll write it in the
harder to understand way, just

75
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,570
so you get used to it.

76
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,130
Such that xi is a member
of the reals.

77
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:20,140
So member of, that's what this
little character means.

78
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,010
So that each xi is a member
of the reals.

79
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:22,770
So what do you you mean xi?

80
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:30,530
Well, xi just means any of these
x's, and I'll write for

81
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,610
i is less than or equal to 2 and
greater than or equal to

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,550
1, and i is an integer.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,090
Now, I could have written this
a bunch of different ways.

84
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,220
This is almost silly how much
effort I'm taking to write it

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,720
this way, but I could have
written it like this, too.

86
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,290
I could have written that R2
is equal to the set of all

87
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:01,180
ordered tuples, x1 x2 such
that-- I could have just

88
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,780
written such that x1 and x2
are a member of the reals.

89
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,670
I could have written
it that way.

90
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,400
That would have been an easier
way to write it.

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,020
But either way, I think
you get the idea.

92
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,110
It's all of the combinations
of two things.

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,460
So I said in the beginning,
this kind of is a squared

94
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,720
operator. and why do
they write it as

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,470
a superscript there?

96
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,750
And my gut sense is if you think
about it, you have an

97
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,290
infinite number of
real numbers.

98
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,430
I won't go into things like
accountability and things like

99
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,820
that, but you have a very large
number of real numbers.

100
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,830
But let's say that you only
had n real numbers, right?

101
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,440
Let's say that we weren't
dealing with reals.

102
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,880
Just for sake of argument, let's
say that you had like

103
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,910
100 real numbers, right?

104
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,430
So that means that there
would've been 100

105
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,880
possibilities there, and then
there's another 100

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,260
possibilities there.

107
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,200
So now your set of all the
possibilities of 2-tuples,

108
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,390
well, you'd have 100 times 100
possibilities, so you'd almost

109
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,030
have the squared number
of possibilities.

110
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,220
So however many possibilities
you have for R, you have that

111
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,670
many squared possibilities for
R2, which doesn't make a lot

112
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,237
of sense, because you have
an infinite number of

113
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:17,170
possibilities, but you have that
many more possibilities.

114
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,470
You have an infinite number of
possibilities here and an

115
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,840
infinite number of possibilities
here.

116
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,120
So it's almost a greater
infinity of potential

117
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,290
possibilities.

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,430
Now, what's R3?

119
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,070
R3 is just the same thing.

120
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:38,940
R3 means you're going to have
three points or three numbers.

121
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,990
I want to be careful not
to just say points.

122
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,550
We can graph these things, and,
for example, R2, point in

123
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,730
R2 can normally be graphed on
graph paper just in Cartesian

124
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,510
coordinates.

125
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,930
Points in R3 can be graphed
in three dimensions.

126
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,300
Points in just R, or we could
just say R1, you could just

127
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,390
graph those on a number line.

128
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,430
I can have a number line like
that, and if I had to graph

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,900
pi, you know, that's 0.

130
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,830
I just say, hey, right
there, that's pi.

131
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,240
And if i had to graph e,
I'd say, hey, right

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,000
there, that's e.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,320
And if I had to graph 1,
I'd say, hey, that's 1.

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,330
So you could graph them, but
I want to be careful.

135
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,370
You don't have to graph them.

136
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,730
They don't have to correspond
to actual

137
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,970
physical points on a graph.

138
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,000
But anyway, when you talk about
R3, you're literally

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,640
just talking about all the
possibilities where you have

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,970
an ordered set of three numbers,
where all three

141
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,060
numbers are a member of
the real numbers.

142
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,680
That's all you're saying.

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,370
Now, I want to introduce
you to another

144
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,275
definition of a vector.

145
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:41,660
   

146
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,780
Now, a vector, you've
seen before.

147
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,740
You've seen it in physics,
where you said, oh, it's

148
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,930
something that has a magnitude
and a direction.

149
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,800
You saw it in calculus, and we
plotted them and whatever not.

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,410
But I'm going to be very formal
and very abstract and

151
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,700
very broad with the vector right
now because the beauty

152
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,230
of linear algebra is that it
doesn't just apply to things

153
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,120
like physics, and it doesn't
just apply-- well, it does

154
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,100
apply a lot to physics, but it
doesn't just apply to that.

155
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,060
In linear algebra, you can
apply it to anything.

156
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,100
It doesn't have to apply to
things that just graphs in

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,780
three dimensions.

158
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,830
And we'll talk more about that
in the future, but that's why

159
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,830
I'm trying to stay
pretty abstract.

160
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,690
So I'm going to define
a vector in Rn, a

161
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,580
vector to be in Rn.

162
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,800
Actually, let me be careful.

163
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,500
I haven't even defined
what Rn is.

164
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,740
I just defined R2 and R3,
so let me define Rn.

165
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:43,409
Rn is equal to the set of all
n-tuples, ordered n-tuples.

166
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,160
So you have x1, x2, all
the way over to xn.

167
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,380
So you're going to have n
things; so if this was 100,

168
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,180
you'd have 100 things here.

169
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,980
So this is an ordered n-tuple.

170
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,442
This is an ordered n-tuple, such
that for each xi, where

171
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,820
xi is one of these, it is a
member of the real, so each of

172
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,210
these has to be a real number.

173
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:19,470
And then I'll just say for i
is less than or equal to n,

174
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,900
greater than or equal to 1.

175
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,990
So all that's saying is that x1
is a member of the reals,

176
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,890
x2 is a member of the reals,
all the way up to xn is a

177
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,910
member of the reals.

178
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,440
Rn is the set of all of these
possible ordered n-tuples or

179
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,360
ordered sets of n numbers.

180
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,800
So what is a vector?

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,810
What is a vector in Rn?

182
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,360
Well, a vector in Rn really is
just a particular instance of

183
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,590
one of these n-tuples.

184
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:55,065
I'll just call it an ordered
list of n real numbers.

185
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:59,930
   

186
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,030
And you can represent a vector
in a bunch of different ways.

187
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,290
You could represent
it like this.

188
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,850
You could represent it like--
let me do it a bunch of

189
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,090
different ways.

190
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,190
A two-dimensional vector, you
could represent like x1, x2,

191
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,180
kind of like a coordinate.

192
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,200
You could maybe represent it
with brackets like that.

193
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,300
This is just syntax.

194
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,150
This is just different ways
of representing the same

195
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,510
information, the same idea.

196
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,440
And for most of what we talk
about in linear algebra, we're

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,690
going to represent them as
essentially these columns, and

198
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,370
in the very near future,
we'll represent

199
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,000
them as rows as well.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,280
But I'm going to define
my vector.

201
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,670
A vector as an Rn is an
ordered list of n real

202
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,390
numbers, and I define-- and
this is an example.

203
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:54,750
So it would be v1, v2, all the
way to vn, where each of these

204
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,155
is a member of the
real numbers.

205
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:01,130
   

206
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,830
And just to make sure you
understand the notation or the

207
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,950
terminology, each of
these is called a

208
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:16,360
component of our vector.

209
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,630
Actually, I want to be very
careful here, because when we

210
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,850
write vectors, you want
to make sure you

211
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,130
have a nice bold v.

212
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,480
I won't make all my v's in the
future that bold, but that's

213
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,540
how, when you're reading a math
book, they differentiate

214
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,200
between just a vector and just
a regular quantity , right?

215
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,090
These regular quantities are
just written non-bolded, while

216
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,530
the vectors are bolded.

217
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:47,850
Now, I'm going to define two
operations for vectors in Rn.

218
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,460
I'm going to define addition,
and these are definitions.

219
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,040
I could've defined them in any
arbitrary way, but these I

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,400
think you'll find to be somewhat
natural, so these are

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,650
definitions.

222
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,120
   

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,000
These are just human abstract
constructs that end up

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,210
becoming very useful.

225
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,800
So they said, hey, let's
make some definitions.

226
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,340
Let's define addition.

227
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,100
   

228
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,510
So, if I have some vector-- let
me write it as a lowercase

229
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,460
a, but it's a really bolded
lowercase a, and then that is

230
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,230
equal to a1, a2.

231
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,900
That's all of it's components
all the way to an, and I want

232
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,120
to add that.

233
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,400
And then I have vector b-- and
I'm going to make that a

234
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,440
really bolded b right there--
is equal to b1, b2, all the

235
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,690
way to bn, I'm going to define
addition of these two vectors

236
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,010
to be just the sum of each
of their components.

237
00:12:51,010 --> 00:13:04,260
Bolded a, plus bolded b is equal
to a new vector, where

238
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,740
you just add each of
their components.

239
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,620
It's going to be a1 plus
b1 is going to

240
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,420
create this new component.

241
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,200
a2 plus b2, all the way
down to an plus bn.

242
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,910
And if you found this somewhat
confusing, just think, I'm

243
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,360
almost going through pains to
write something very simple in

244
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,130
very confusing terms. If I have
two vectors in R2, let's

245
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,810
say I have the vector 2, minus
1, and I want to add that to

246
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:41,060
the vector 3, 2, I literally
just add each of the

247
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,280
corresponding components.

248
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,460
So I add the first components
to each other.

249
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,390
So 2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

250
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,030
Minus 1 plus 2 is equal to 1.

251
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,740
That's all my definition of
vector addition is for my

252
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,490
vectors in real numbers.

253
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,410
And now the next thing I'm going
to define is the idea of

254
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,660
a scalar multiple.

255
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,260
   

256
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,490
You might remember from physics
class, a scalar is

257
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,930
just a regular number, or if
your multiplying something by

258
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,920
a scalar, you're just
scaling it up.

259
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,710
Maybe I shouldn't use the same
word in the definition, but

260
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,990
I'm going to define it as--
let me say c is a scalar.

261
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,110
So notice, I didn't
bold the c.

262
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,070
So c times my vector a-- and
here I'm going to take pains

263
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:36,120
to bold it up-- is going to be
equal to all of my components

264
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,500
of vector a multiplied by
each, multiplied by c.

265
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,840
So a1, a2, all the way to an,
and they're each going to be

266
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,790
multiplied by c.

267
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,800
So that's all I define-- every
term is going to be

268
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,870
multiplied by c.

269
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,070
And just to give you an example
like that, if I wrote

270
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:04,630
minus 3 times some vector--
I'll just

271
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,390
draw the vector here.

272
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,010
Let me draw a vector in R3.

273
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:14,370
So let's say the first term is
pi, the second term is minus

274
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,200
2, and then the third term is 0,
then this is just going to

275
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:26,360
be equal to a new vector in R3
or you can kind of view it as

276
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,100
a three-dimensional vector,
minus 3pi, minus 3 times minus

277
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,360
2 is positive 6, and then minus
3 times 0 is just 0.

278
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,100
So it's that straightforward.

279
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,750
They made this fancy definition,
but it's fairly

280
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,550
easy to deal with, I think.

281
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,380
And I'll just make one last
definition, and I'll call that

282
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,630
the zero vector.

283
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,350
   

284
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,760
And depending on what dimension
we're in, it just

285
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,240
means a vector with
all zeroes.

286
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,150
So the zero vector in Rn, if
it's arbitrary, is just a

287
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,010
vector where everything
is zero.

288
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,145
And if this is Rn, you just
have n components.

289
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:13,080
   

290
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,950
So those are all
my definitions.

291
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,060
I think I've given you enough
to think about right now in

292
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,510
this video.

293
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,140
In the next video, I'm going
to show a bunch more of

294
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,050
examples, and I'll actually draw
representations of these

295
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,190
vectors, although you don't
have to, and we'll kind of

296
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,950
have a little more visual
understanding

297
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,680
of what they mean.
