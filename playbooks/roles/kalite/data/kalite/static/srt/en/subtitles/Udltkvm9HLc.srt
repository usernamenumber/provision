1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:02,995
So, we're going back to our little burger stand

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:05,000
where we had our demand curve

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,382
in terms of burgers per hour, and now I want

4
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,240
to think about something, from the persepective of

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,909
our burger stand, and think about at any given point

6
00:00:13,909 --> 00:00:16,417
on this demand curve, how much revenue would

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:19,714
we get per hour? And when I talk about revenue,

8
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:22,732
let's just think about in terms of

9
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,636
"How many total sales will I get in a given hour?"

10
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:31,231
Let me just write it over here - total revenue.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,321
Well, the total revenue is going to be how

12
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:34,992
much I get per burger times

13
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:37,732
the number of burgers I get. The amount that

14
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:41,308
I get per burger is price, so it's going to be equal to

15
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:44,373
price ; and then the total number of burgers in that

16
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:49,900
hour is going to be the quantity.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,968
Pretty straightforward.

18
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:59,373
If I sell 10 things at $5, I am going to get $50 of revenue -

19
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:02,299
$50 of sales in that hour.

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,900
Now, let's think about what the total revenue will

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,711
look like at different points along

22
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,569
this curve right over here.

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,401
Actually, let me just make a little table right over here.

24
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:17,067
So if I make one column price, one column quantity,

25
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:23,708
and then let's make one column total revenue.

26
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,401
Alright, so let's look at a couple of scenarios here.

27
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,073
We could actually look at some of these points that

28
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:33,850
we already have defined. At Point A here, price is $9

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,386
- so I'll do it in Point A's colour - price is $9,

30
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:39,962
quantity is 2. $9 x 2 burgers.

31
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:43,073
$9 per burger x 2 burgers per hour - your total

32
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,046
revenue is going to be $18. And you can see it

33
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:50,800
visually right over here: this height, this height right over here is $9,

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,730
and this width right over here is 2, and your total revenue

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,909
is going to be the area of this rectangle, because the height

36
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:02,578
is the price and the width is the quantity.

37
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:07,067
So, that total revenue is the area, right over there.

38
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,133
Now, let's go to point - let me do a couple of them,

39
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,724
just to make it really clear for us - let's try Point B.

40
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,975
So, at Point B, when our price is $8, and

41
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,040
our quantity is 4 - 4 burgers per hour - our total

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,800
revenue is going to be $8 x 4 which is $32 per hour.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,727
Once again, you can see that visually. The height

44
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,400
here is $8, and the width here - so the height

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,715
of this rectangle is $8 - and the width is 4. The total

46
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:37,733
revenue is going to be the area: it's going to be the

47
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:41,077
height times the width, just like that.

48
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,653
Now, let's go to a Point that I haven't actually graphed

49
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:47,718
here, actually - let me just, actually - I'll go through

50
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:53,569
all the Points, just for fun. So, now at Point C, we have $5.50.

51
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,399
$5.50 is the price. The quantity is 9. $5.50 x 9.

52
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:04,065
9 x 5 = $45, and then you have another $4.50, so that

53
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:09,312
is $49.50. So, once again, it's going to be the area

54
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:14,400
of this rectangle, the area of that rectangle right over there.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,133
So, you might already be noticing something interesting.

56
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,715
As we lower the price, at least in this part

57
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:22,408
of our demand curve - as we lower the price -

58
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:25,659
we are actually increasing, not just the quantity,

59
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,074
we're increasing the total revenue. Let's see if this

60
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:34,297
keeps happening. So, if we go to Point D - I'll do it

61
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,569
in that same colour - we have $4.50, and we are

62
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,749
selling 11 units. 11 x $4.50, let's see this is going

63
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:48,043
to be $44 plus $5.50. Once again, that is $49.50.

64
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,737
So, this rectangle is going to have the same

65
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:55,381
area as that pink one that we just did for scenario C.

66
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:57,563
Now, I'll actually just do one more down here,

67
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,328
just to see what happens, because this is interesting.

68
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:00,721
Now we've lowered the price, and it looks like

69
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,467
things didn't change much. And now let's go

70
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,062
and just do one more Point, actually, for

71
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,709
the sake of time - Point E. And I encourage you

72
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,656
to do other ones - try F on your own! Point E - my price

73
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:16,580
is $2 per burger, my quantity is 16 burgers per hour.

74
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,667
I sell a total of 32 burgers [Should be: My total revenue is $32 per hour].

75
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,664
Actually, let's just do the last one - F - just to feel

76
00:04:22,664 --> 00:04:27,633
a sense of completion, So, $1 per burger, I sell 18 burgers

77
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:30,333
per hour. My total revenue, when you multiply them

78
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,321
is $18 per hour. And once again, that's the area of

79
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:38,175
this rectangle. This short and fat rectangle, right over here.

80
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:43,005
And E, was the total area - the total revenue at E was

81
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,652
the area of that, right over there.

82
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,649
And you could graph these, just to get a sense

83
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:50,900
of how total revenue actually changes with respect

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,172
to price or quantity. Let's plot total revenue wih respect

85
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:58,210
to quantity. So, let's try it out.

86
00:05:02,872 --> 00:05:07,218
So this is going to be total revenue, and this axis

87
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:10,590
right over here is going to be quantity.

88
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,067
And we're once again going to be from - let's see,

89
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:21,829
this is zero, this is 5, this is 10, this is 15, and this is 20, right over here.

90
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,661
And then total revenue - let's see, it gets as high - it gets

91
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:31,508
pretty close to $50. So let's go - this is $10, $20, $30, $40, and $50.

92
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:37,364
So that's $50, $40, $30, $20, and $10.

93
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:39,987
So when our quantity is 2, and our price is $9

94
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,309
- but we don't have price right on this axis here -

95
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,652
our quantity is 2, and our total revenue is $18.

96
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:50,343
So, it's going to be something like there.

97
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:59,584
Then, when our quantity is 4, our total revenue is $32, right about there.

98
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:07,572
Then, when our quantity is 9, our total revenue is almost $50.

99
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:11,705
So, right over there. And then, when it's 11, it's also

100
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:17,510
at that same point, right over there, And then,

101
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:25,173
when our quantity is 16, our total revenue is $32.

102
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:32,867
And then finally, when our quantity is 18, our total revenue is $18.

103
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:36,365
And what you see, is that it's plotting out a curve

104
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:37,933
that looks like this, and if you remember some of

105
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:44,445
your Algebra 2, this is a concave downwards parabola, right over here!

106
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,200
And you can see, there is actually some point

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,507
at which you can maximise your total revenue, and

108
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:51,533
if you really tried all the points here, you'd see that

109
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:57,170
maximum point is if you tried this point right over here.

110
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,188
Right at price $5, and quantity 10.

111
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:03,393
At price $5 and quantity 10, in that hour you would

112
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,600
sell [gain] $50. So this is the maximum point

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,851
right over there, $50.

114
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,777
Now the whole reason why I'm talking about this

115
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:15,200
- I could have talked about this independently of any discussion of elasticity, just to see how total

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,832
revenue relates to price and quantity at different points on the demand curve -

117
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:23,176
but there is an interesting relationship. In that

118
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,845
very first video, and we actually used this exact demand curve for it,

119
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,699
when we explored elasticity, we saw that up here, at

120
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,393
this part of the curve - let me do this in a different colour -

121
00:07:33,393 --> 00:07:41,613
at this point of the curve in orange, for any change - when you do a change in your price,

122
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:45,000
since the prices are pretty high - that is a much lower

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,929
percent change in price than the impact that

124
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:50,436
you get on quantity. Because, over here, although

125
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,266
they look like they're close, the, or I should say, the absolute

126
00:07:55,266 --> 00:08:00,700
- for every 1 down we move in price, we're moving 2 up in quantity -

127
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,600
but that 1 down in price is a very small percentage of price,

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,533
because our prices are high here, and it's a very large

129
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,105
percentage of quantity right over here.

130
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:13,517
So, you get huge changes in percent quantity for very small changes in price

131
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:21,867
at this part of the curve. So, this part of the curve is elastic.

132
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:26,613
Or, you could say that its price elasticity for demand is >1.

133
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:31,954
You get larger changes in percent quantity for a given change in percent price.

134
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:40,173
Now, these parts of the curve down here, we saw the opposites happening.

135
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:44,121
You move 1 unit down in price, you move 2 units

136
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,333
to the right in quantity, but over here, price is much

137
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,667
lower, so this is a much larger change, percentage change in price,

138
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:55,777
and this is a much smaller percentage change in quantity.

139
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:58,935
So, you get large percentage changes in price for small

140
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:01,257
percentage changes in quantity. That means that here,

141
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:06,366
you are relatively inelastic.

142
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,502
And then, right over here, right at this point -

143
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:10,733
right in this region right over here, we saw that

144
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:15,607
we had unit - we were unit elasticity right over there.

145
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:18,904
So, there's an interesting relationship going on.

146
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:23,920
While we were elastic - this part right over here -

147
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,260
when we lowered price in this region - while we were elastic -

148
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,254
when we lowered price, we got increases in revenue.

149
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:34,601
So, let me write this down.

150
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:37,248
And this is generally true - there's a couple of boundary cases

151
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,106
on the math that make it a little bit - you can't

152
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:44,911
make it absolutely true, but while we are elastic,

153
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:49,090
at the elastic points of our demand curve, a decrease in price -

154
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,942
price goes down, total revenue was going up.

155
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,171
You do a price cut on this part of the demand curve,

156
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:10,685
you get more revenue. Then, when you are at unit elasticity,

157
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,333
what was happening?

158
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,536
Unit elasticity you are right at this point right over here,

159
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:20,600
and roughly, when you do a price cut, and I'm going

160
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,542
to say that this is roughly true - your total revenue stays constant.

161
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,097
But just right at the point, right when you're going through

162
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,186
that point, that unit elasticity point. And, finally,

163
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:38,502
when you are inelastic, when large percent changes

164
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:43,425
in price result in not so large percent changes in quantity demanded,

165
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:51,552
then a price change going down,

166
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:54,524
resulted in a lower total revenue - resulted in total

167
00:10:54,524 --> 00:10:58,867
revenue going down. And this should hopefully

168
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,769
make a little bit of intuitive sense, because over here,

169
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,877
at this point, if given percent change in price,

170
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,933
you were getting a larger percent change in quantity.

171
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:13,982
So, the percent in price went down, your percent in quantity grew even more,

172
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:17,698
so you made up any decrease in height with an increase

173
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:20,391
in width, so your area increased. Down here,

174
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:24,106
your decrease in percent price wasn't made up

175
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:28,379
for a decrease in percent quantity, so when you made

176
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:32,791
your rectangles a little bit shorter, you weren't able

177
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,320
to compensate by growing the width as much - so, you

178
00:11:36,320 --> 99:59:59,999
actually had a lower area, a lower total revenue.
