1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,510
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,280
We were in the midst of figuring
out the Laplace

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,210
transform of sine of at when
I was running out of time.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,980
This was the definition
of the Laplace

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,470
transform of sine of at.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,380
I said that also equals y.

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,750
This is going to be useful for
us, since we're going to be

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,120
doing integration
by parts twice.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,130
So I did integration by parts
once, then I did integration

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,160
by parts twice.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,900
I said, you know, don't worry
about the boundaries of the

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,700
integral right now.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,390
Let's just worry about the
indefinite integral.

15
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,820
And then after we solve for y--
let's just say y is the

16
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,270
indefinite version of this--
then we can evaluate the

17
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,830
boundaries.

18
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,540
And we got to this point, and we
made the realization, after

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,480
doing two integration by parts
and being very careful not to

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,560
hopefully make any careless
mistakes, we realized, wow,

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,240
this is our original y.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,410
If I put the boundaries here,
that's the same thing as the

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,100
Laplace transform of
sine of at, right?

24
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,760
That's our original y.

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,700
So now-- and I'll switch colors
just avoid monotony--

26
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,295
this is equal to, actually,
let me just-- this is y.

27
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:05,209
   

28
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:05,560
Right?

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,600
That was our original
definition.

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,420
So let's add a squared over
sine squared y to

31
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,900
both sides of this.

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,400
So this is equal to y plus--
I'm just adding this whole

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,130
term to both sides of this
equation-- plus a squared over

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,470
s squared y is equal to-- so
this term is now gone, so it's

35
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,475
equal to this stuff.

36
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,260
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

37
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,845
So let's factor out an e to the
minus st. Actually, let's

38
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:45,360
factor out a negative e to the
minus st. So it's minus e to

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:58,320
the minus st, times sine of--
well, let me just write 1 over

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:10,900
s, sine of at, minus 1 over
s squared, cosine of at.

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,650
I really hope I haven't made
any careless mistakes.

42
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,010
And so this, we can add
the coefficient.

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:22,030
So we get 1 plus a squared,
over s squared, times y.

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,440
But that's the same thing as s
squared over s squared, plus a

45
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,100
squared over s squared.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,920
So it's s squared plus a
squared, over s squared, y is

47
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,320
equal to minus e to the minus
st, times this whole thing,

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:47,510
sine of at, minus 1 over s
squared, cosine of at.

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,410
And now, this right here, since
we're doing everything

50
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,050
with respect to dt, this is
just a constant, right?

51
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,740
So we can say a constant
times the

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,290
antiderivative is equal to this.

53
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,360
This is as good a time as any
to evaluate the boundaries.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,580
Right?

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,440
If this had a t here, I would
have to somehow get them back

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,820
on the other side.

57
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,230
Because the t's are involved in
evaluating the boundaries,

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,040
since we're doing our definite
integral or improper integral.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,230
So let's evaluate the
boundaries now.

60
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,620
And we could've kept
them along with us

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,810
the whole time, right?

62
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,510
And just factored out this
term right here.

63
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,920
But anyway.

64
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,090
So let's evaluate this
from 0 to infinity.

65
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,050
And this should simplify
things.

66
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,820
So the right-hand side of this
equation, when I evaluate it

67
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,290
at infinity, what is e to
the minus infinity?

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,250
Well, that is 0.

69
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,850
We've established that
multiple times.

70
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,350
And now it approaches 0 from
the negative side, but it's

71
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,020
still going to be 0,
or it approaches 0.

72
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,010
What's sine of infinity?

73
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,130
Well, sine just keeps
oscillating, between negative

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,840
1 and plus 1, and
so does cosine.

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,470
Right?

76
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,970
So this is bounded.

77
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,180
So this thing is going
to overpower these.

78
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,030
And if you're curious,
you can graph it.

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,220
This kind of forms an envelope
around these oscillations.

80
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,110
So the limit, as this approaches
infinity, is going

81
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,360
to be equal to 0.

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,780
   

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,450
And that makes sense, right?

84
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,270
These are bounded between
0 and negative 1.

85
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,750
And this approaches
0 very quickly.

86
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,420
So it's 0 times something
bounded between 1

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,540
and negative 1.

88
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,360
Another way to view it is the
largest value this could equal

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,390
is 1 times whatever
coefficient's on it, and then

90
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,080
this is going to 0.

91
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,310
So it's like 0 times 1.

92
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,610
Anyway, I don't want to focus
too much on that.

93
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,830
You can play around with
that if you like.

94
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,880
Minus this whole thing
evaluated at 0.

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,840
So what's e to the minus 0?

96
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Well, e to the minus 0 is 1.

97
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,310
Right?

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,780
That's e to the 0.

99
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,160
We have a minus 1, so it becomes
plus 1 times-- now,

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,370
sine of 0 is 0.

101
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,190
Minus 1 over s squared,
cosine of 0.

102
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,390
   

103
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,580
Let's see.

104
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:11,190
Cosine of 0 is 1, so we have
minus 1 over s squared, minus

105
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,230
1 over s squared, times 1.

106
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:23,720
So that is equal to minus
1 over s squared.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,100
And I think I made a mistake,
because I shouldn't be having

108
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,270
a negative number here.

109
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,260
So let's backtrack.

110
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,910
Maybe this isn't a
negative number?

111
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,310
Let's see, infinity, right?

112
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,660
This whole thing is 0.

113
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,800
When when you put 0 here,
this becomes a minus 1.

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,460
Yeah.

115
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,750
So either this is a plus
or this is a plus.

116
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,480
Let's see where I
made my mistake.

117
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,130
e to the minus st-- oh, I
see where my mistake is.

118
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,650
Right up here.

119
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,650
Where I factored out a minus
e to the minus st, right?

120
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,270
Fair enough.

121
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,920
So that makes this 1
over s, sine of at.

122
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,840
But if I factor out a minus e to
the minus st, this becomes

123
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,680
a plus, right?

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,005
It was a minus here, but I'm
factoring out of a minus e to

125
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:16,980
the minus st.

126
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,420
So that's a plus.

127
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,160
This is a plus.

128
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,470
Boy, I'm glad that was not
too difficult to find.

129
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,170
So then this becomes a plus.

130
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,550
And then this becomes a plus.

131
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,165
Thank God.

132
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,420
It would have been sad if I
wasted two videos and ended up

133
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,030
with a careless, negative
number.

134
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,470
Anyway.

135
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:39,660
So now we have s squared plus
a squared, over s squared,

136
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,880
times y is equal to this.

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,480
Multiply both sides times
s squared over-- s

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,010
squared plus a squared.

139
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:49,420
Divide both sides by this, and
we get y is equal to 1 over s

140
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:56,570
squared-- And actually, let me
make sure that that is right.

141
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,870
It's 1 over s squared.

142
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,980
y is equal to 1 over s squared,
times s squared, over

143
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,760
s squared plus a squared.

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,570
And then these cancel out.

145
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,090
And let me make sure
that I haven't made

146
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,202
another careless mistake.

147
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:16,750
Because I have a

148
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,970
feeling I have. Yep.

149
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,360
There.

150
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,150
I see the careless mistake.

151
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,090
And it was all in this term.

152
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,010
And I hope you don't mind my
careless mistakes, but I want

153
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,720
you to see that I'm doing these
things in real time and

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,470
I am human, in case you haven't
realized already.

155
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,600
Anyway, so I made the same
careless mistake.

156
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,410
So I factor out an e to the
minus st here, so it's plus.

157
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,310
But it was a over s squared.

158
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,290
So this is an a.

159
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,720
That's an a.

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,640
And so this is an a.

161
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,370
And so this is an a.

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,470
And so this is an a.

163
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,740
Right?

164
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,640
This was an a.

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,730
And this is the correct
answer.

166
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,120
a over s squared
plus a squared.

167
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
So I hope those careless
mistakes didn't

168
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,910
throw you off too much.

169
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,490
These things happen when you do
integration by parts twice

170
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,840
with a bunch of variables.

171
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,430
But anyway, now we are ready
to add a significant entry

172
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,600
into our table of Laplace
transforms. And that is that

173
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,860
the Laplace transform-- I had
an extra curl, there.

174
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,520
That was unecessary.

175
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,740
Let me do it again.

176
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:40,230
The Laplace transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

177
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,159
squared, plus a squared.

178
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,210
And that's a significant
entry.

179
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,100
And maybe a good exercise for
you, just to see how fun it is

180
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,070
to do these integration by parts
problems twice, is to

181
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,390
figure out the Laplace transform
of cosine of at.

182
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,240
And I'll give you a hint.

183
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,410
It's s over s squared over
s squared plus a squared.

184
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,620
And it's nice that there's
that symmetry there.

185
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,330
Anyway, I'm almost
at my time limit.

186
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,850
And I'm very tired working
on this video.

187
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,360
So I'll leave it there and I'll
see you in the next one.

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
