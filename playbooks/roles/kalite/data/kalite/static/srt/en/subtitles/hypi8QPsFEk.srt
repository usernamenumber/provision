1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,950
I've been sent is pretty
interesting algebra problem,

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,760
and I think the question isn't
properly formed, or it might be

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,400
missing some piece
of information.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,050
But it's an interesting
question nonetheless so I

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,340
thought I'd work it out,
and we can talk about why

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,150
it's not properly formed.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,520
So they give us a
function, f of x.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,910
They say it's a third degree
polynomial of the form

10
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:28,020
ax to the third plus bx
squared plus cx plus d.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,280
And they tell us a couple of
the 0's of this polynomial.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,330
They say that we have 0's at
the point minus 1, 0 and

13
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,150
the point 2 comma 0.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,360
And they tell us we have a
y-intercept, y-intercept,

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,760
at the point 0, minus 2.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,320
And what they ask us is, what
is a plus b plus c plus d?

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,330
So let's see if we can make
some headway on this.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,830
So the first thing is to think
about, is what would a third

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,010
degree polynomial look like and
what are we even talking

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,070
about when we say 0's.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,430
So let me just draw a
little bit of a graph.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,280
And I don't know exactly what
this third degree polynomial

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,150
looks like just yet.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,840
Let me draw my axis.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,880
Now a third degree polynomial
can have as many as three 0's.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,350
And 0's are just the
points where the

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,750
function is equal to 0.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,730
So, we have a 0 at minus 1, 0.

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,320
So that's minus 1, 0,
that's right there.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,640
We have a zero 2, 0.

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,110
1, 2, 0.

32
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,530
So those are the two 0's
that they've given us.

33
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,290
They also told us the
y-intercept at 0, minus 2.

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,720
So it intersects the
y-axis right there.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,200
But this guy can have
as many as three 0's.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,270
Now some of them
might be complex.

37
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,750
But complex 0's come in
pairs of two, the two

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,980
complex conjugates.

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,710
I won't go into too
much detail here.

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,630
So this one must have a third
real 0, because if the third

41
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,060
one was complex, you'd need
another complex 0, and you

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,920
can't have four 0's for a
third degree polynomial.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,760
So that third root, it could
be sitting some place out

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,460
here, maybe over here.

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,910
Or it could even be a
repeat of one of these

46
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,850
two roots over here.

47
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,890
But let's just assume that
there's some third root, we

48
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,260
don't know what it looks like.

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,610
Let's say it looks something
like-- let's say that third

50
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,410
root is sitting out
here some place.

51
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,550
And then a potential graph, and
I could be completely wrong,

52
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,750
I'm just guessing, but just to
get a sense of what third

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,980
degree polynomials look like,
and how can a graph intersect

54
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,160
the x-axis three times, a
potential graph might look

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,880
something like this.

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,305
Curves and bam, hits the other
0, hits the y-intercept, and

57
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:40,530
then goes back up like that.

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,040
It might go like that, it might
go the other way, go like that.

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,120
Up, and then down like that.

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,920
Well, there's many ways you
could draw something that

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,580
essentially curves twice to
intersect these three points

62
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,870
and also that y-intercept,
but I'm not going to go into

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,720
all of those right now.

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,190
But let's see if we can figure
out the coefficients here.

65
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,590
So the key point is me
telling you that there

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,250
must be a third 0 here.

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,600
Let's call that third 0, it's
at the point, it's at the

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,470
point-- let's call
it --r3 comma 0.

69
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,390
And I'm using the
letter r for roots.

70
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,890
Roots are the x
values of the 0's.

71
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,950
So if we say f of minus 1 is
equal to 0, we say that x is

72
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,720
equal to minus 1 is a root.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,360
Similarly, we know that f of
2, f of 2, is equal to 0.

74
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,780
Or we could say x equals 2
is a root, these are roots.

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,160
So when someone tells you a 0
they're also essentially

76
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,360
telling you the roots, and then
we know there must be a third

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,300
root at x is equal to r3.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,340
So x is equal to r3.

79
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,980
Now, if we have a third degree
polynomial where these three x

80
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,570
values make it 0, we can
rewrite this third degree

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,270
polynomial as-- we can rewrite
it as-- I'll do it in a

82
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:07,820
slightly different color --f of
x is equal to x plus 1-- you'll

83
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,300
see why I'm doing x plus 1
instead of x minus 1 in a

84
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:20,230
second --plus 1 times x
minus 2 times x minus r3.

85
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,015
And we want to put an a out
front, and I'll tell you in

86
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,550
a second why I'm putting
this a out front.

87
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,400
Because if you were to multiply
just the x terms here, when

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,370
actually do your distributed
property and multiply out these

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,260
binomials, you'll just get x to
the third, but we had

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,390
an ax to the third.

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,360
So you just needed a constant
a there to make this

92
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,100
an ax to the third.

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,490
Now, why did I write
out like this?

94
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,520
Well, if you put a minus 1 in
here what's going to happen?

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,660
This term is going to
be minus 1 plus 1.

96
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,850
It's going to be 0.

97
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,210
Who cares what these are
or what a is, the whole

98
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,380
thing's going to be 0.

99
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,170
If we put x is equal
to 2, this term right

100
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,610
here is going to be 0.

101
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,190
Who cares what the other
terms or the a is, f

102
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,070
of 2 is going to be 0.

103
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,360
Similarly, when x is equal to
r3, this last term is 0, who

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,170
cares about anything over here.

105
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,550
So we know that this guy
up here can be rewritten

106
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,520
in this form over here.

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,490
And so if we can solve for r3
we can just multiply this thing

108
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,370
out and try to do a little bit
of pattern matching to figure

109
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,760
out what these coefficients
are going to be.

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,100
Now, the other big clue they
gave us is a y-intercept.

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,640
That point right there,
the point 0, minus 2.

112
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,160
They're telling us that f
of 0 is equal to minus 2.

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,940
Well what's f of 0?

114
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,730
f of 0-- I'll write it here --f
of 0-- If you put 0 in here,

115
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,420
this term becomes 0, this term
becomes 0, that term becomes 0,

116
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,840
you are just left with the d.

117
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,940
So f of 0 is equal to d.

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,760
Or we could say that d
must be equal to minus 2.

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,530
d is equal to minus 2, so
we solved at least one

120
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,090
of the call efficient.

121
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,450
The constant term. d
is equal to minus 2.

122
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,970
Now, if d is equal to minus 2,
that means all of these

123
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,740
constant terms, when you were
to multiply out this

124
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,340
expression, and I would include
the a, because the a is scaling

125
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,620
everything, that must
be equal to minus 2.

126
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,730
Let me be clear here.

127
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,910
So let me rewrite
this expression.

128
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,970
This is equal to, I'll just
multiply this a times

129
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,740
this last term.

130
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,400
We do it in any order you want,
so this is the same thing as x

131
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:36,450
plus 1 times x minus 2 to times
a a minus r, let me

132
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,870
write, minus ar3.

133
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,400
This is the exact same thing as
this thing up here, I'll just

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,860
write this is with f of x is
equal to, and this is the exact

135
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,460
same thing is that up there.

136
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,560
Now, to solve for an r3, or
attempt to solve for an r3, you

137
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,540
just have to realize that when
you multiply this thing out,

138
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,690
the way to get the constant
term over here, or the d over

139
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,840
here, that's going to be a
product of the constant

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,310
terms in our expressions.

141
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,920
Because if I introduced any
products with any x terms,

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,870
you're going to get one of
these other terms over here.

143
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,300
The ax cubed term is generated
from that term, that term,

144
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,320
and that term, being
multiplied together.

145
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,680
and then the constant term
is multiplied by the

146
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,790
constant terms to be
multiplied together.

147
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,080
And then the two in the middle
are multiplied by different

148
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,260
combinations of constant terms.

149
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,460
And you'll see that if
you actually want to

150
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,260
multiply this out.

151
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,000
But if you take my word for it,
that times that times that

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,340
times, actually let me
write it this way.

153
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,820
That times that times that,
have got to be equal to date we

154
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,550
can then attempt to find some
relationship between a and d,

155
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,500
which is mine is minus 2.

156
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,890
So we could say 1 times minus
2 times minus ar3, these two

157
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,050
minuses will cancel out.

158
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,170
It is going to be
equal to our d terms.

159
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:07,110
It's going to be equal to minus
2, and so if we simplify that a

160
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:14,720
little bit we get 2ar3 is equal
to minus 2, divide both sides

161
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,755
by 2a and you get r3 is
equal to minus 1/a.

162
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,320
   

163
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,010
So we haven't solved for the
third root, we've just gotten

164
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,990
it in terms of, in terms
of our coefficient a.

165
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,060
But letls see if we can still
use that in some useful way.

166
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,710
So if r3 is minus 1/a, this
term right here becomes what?

167
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,210
Let me rewrite it.

168
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,260
Let me rewrite it.

169
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,030
All right, I'll do it in blue.

170
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:50,700
f of x is going to be equal to
x plus 1 times x minus 2 times

171
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,610
ax-- now minus a times r3.

172
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,250
Let me do it over here.

173
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,780
Minus a times r3
three is minus 1/a.

174
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
So that's a minus
times a minus.

175
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,420
That's a plus.

176
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
The a's cancel out.

177
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,210
You just get a 1.

178
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,300
So this term now if we
substitute r3 with this will

179
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,140
just turn into a this will
just turn into a plus 1.

180
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,640
Minus a times minus
1/a that's plus 1.

181
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,450
Plus 1.

182
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,160
We just substituted that for
that to get this right here.

183
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,790
Now let's multiply
this thing out.

184
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,120
Let's actually do the
algebraic multiplication

185
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,130
and see what we get.

186
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,980
So first I'm going to
multiply these two terms.

187
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,580
I'm going to do it in
a different color.

188
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,050
Let me multiply those
two terms right there.

189
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,740
So this is going to be equal to
x squared, x squared plus 1x

190
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,400
minus 2x So that's
minus x, right?

191
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,235
1 times x is x, minus 2
times x is x minus 2x.

192
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:53,110
So it's minus x, and then minus
2, just multiplied these two

193
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,940
binomials out right here.

194
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,000
And then I'm going to have to
multiply that times ax plus 1,

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,880
so I'm going to write the
ax plus 1 down here

196
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,720
just to save space.

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,810
ax plus 1.

198
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,600
And now we just do a little bit
of algebraic multiplication.

199
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,140
1 times minus 2 is-- I'll do
it in magenta --minus 2.

200
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,150
1 times minus x is minus x.

201
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,690
1 times x squared is x squared.

202
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,820
Now ax times minus
2 is minus 2ax.

203
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,910
Minus 2ax.

204
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:37,680
ax times minus x is minus
ax squared, right?

205
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,160
Minus ax squared and
then ax times x squared

206
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,020
is ax to the third.

207
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,750
ax to the third.

208
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,220
Then we add everything
together, and we get our f of x

209
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,380
is going to be equal to ax to
the third-- let me scroll to

210
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,710
the left a little bit
--ax to the third.

211
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,920
x squared minus ax squared.

212
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,620
So that's plus 1 minus
a, 1 minus a x squared.

213
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,360
And then we have these two
added together so this is minus

214
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:17,660
1 minus 2a or we could call
this equal to-- so minus 1

215
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:25,890
minus 2a --or we could say
minus 1 plus 2ax and then we

216
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,090
have our minus 2, which makes
sense because that is our d.

217
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,300
That's our d.

218
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,030
So this is really the solution.

219
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,410
This is the form that are
equation is going to take and

220
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,590
the reason why I said in the
beginning of the problem that

221
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,270
the equation or the problem
wasn't well defined is that I

222
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,430
can pick any real number a
and this equation will

223
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,280
satisfy these conditions
that we were given.

224
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,270
So I suspect that I wasn't
given all of the constraints

225
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,940
on this problem.

226
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,930
Maybe there was a third
constraint that a is equal to

227
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,990
1, or b is equal to something
else, or a plus b is

228
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,860
equal to something else.

229
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,060
But just using these
constraints, just using these

230
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,050
constraints, the equation
will take this form.

231
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,690
So, if it was in this form, of
course this is a, this is b,

232
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,800
which would be 1 minus a,
that's b, that's a, and then

233
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,540
this right here is equal to c.

234
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,730
So we could pick, you know, we
could pick one particular

235
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,320
choice if we just want to get
an answer to their problem, but

236
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,210
it might not be the answer they
were looking for because they

237
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,670
might have picked
a different a.

238
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,290
But if you just pick a simple
a is equal to 1, than

239
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,690
what's b equal to?

240
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,750
Then b is equal to 1 minus
a, which is equal to 0.

241
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,730
Then b is equal to 0, and then
c is equal-- actually c would

242
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,530
include this minus sign right
there --c would be one plus 2a.

243
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,470
So 2a is 2, 1 plus 2 is 3.

244
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,790
Put a minus sign.

245
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,920
So c would be equal to minus 3.

246
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,280
And of course no matter
what we do, d is going

247
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,480
to be equal to minus 2.

248
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,230
So if we pick a is equal to 1,
the answer here to what is a

249
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,970
plus b plus c plus d, would
be equal to 1 plus minus 3.

250
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,410
1 plus minus 3 is minus 2.

251
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,530
Minus another minus
2 is minus 4.

252
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,110
That's another possibility, but
we just as easily could have

253
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,310
picked, you know a could have
been something, it could be a

254
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,630
fraction, it could be anything.

255
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,310
It could be, you know
a could be minus 1.

256
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,990
a could be equal to minus 1, if
a is equal to minus 1, then b

257
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,930
is equal to 2, then b
is equal to 2, right?

258
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,400
1 minus minus 1.

259
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,790
And then c is equal to 1 minus
2, which is minus 1, but then

260
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,400
you have a minus out front.

261
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,040
So then c is equal to 1,
and then d is always going

262
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,230
to be equal to minus 2.

263
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,930
d is equal to minus 2.

264
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,020
And then you have a plus b plus
c plus d would be equal to.,

265
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,350
well these would cancel out,
you'd get them equal to 0.

266
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,110
So, we don't know exactly what
answer the problem writer

267
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,500
was looking for, but it is a
pretty interesting problem.

268
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,530
And then you know, just out of
curiosity, it-- let's take this

269
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,750
first example that we took
--where a is equal to 1, we

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,280
could then look at what
our root must be.

271
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,470
If a is equal to 1, then our
third root is that r3 would be

272
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,790
equal-- that's just for this
situation right here --than r3

273
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,330
would be equal to negative 1
divided by 1 would be equal to

274
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,410
minus 1, which means that we
would have a repeated root, we

275
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,940
would have a repeated
root, right there.

276
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,830
We wouldn't necessarily have
a distinct root out there.

277
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,730
And if we're curious about what
that would look like, let's

278
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,130
look at the situation
where a is equal to 1.

279
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,280
Actually maybe we wil
look at both of them.

280
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,710
When a is equal to 1, our
equation is x to the third--

281
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,140
where is the x button --x to
the third, there's no x

282
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:03,040
squared term, minus 3x minus
3x, minus 3x, minus 2.

283
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,880
So let's grab both of
them simultaneously.

284
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,160
So that's this one, where
we picked this choice

285
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,210
of coefficients.

286
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,760
And then let's do this choice
of coefficients, if we have, if

287
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:23,270
we have minus x to the third,
right? a is minus 1 plus 2 x

288
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:31,350
squared, and then we have, plus
x, c is 1, plus x minus 2.

289
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,520
So those are 2 graps.

290
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,370
Let's see what they look like.

291
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,640
Let's graph them.

292
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,500
So our first one, there we
go, we hit that point,

293
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
that's our double root.

294
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,200
Notice, both of these
two graphs meet our

295
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,480
two constraints.

296
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,790
They both have a root
there at minus 1.

297
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,310
They both have a y-intercept
at y is equal to minus 2.

298
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,780
And they both have a
root at x is equal to

299
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,420
positive 2 right there.

300
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,480
Now the second one right here
had a separate distinct third

301
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,960
root, while the first one,
here, has a double root

302
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
right over there.

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,230
Anyway, I actually think this
problem was somewhat more

304
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,850
interesting by the fact we
had to actually look at the

305
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,240
different solutions to it.

306
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,030
And there's actually an
infinite number of solutions

307
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,180
to this based on what
you choose for your a.
