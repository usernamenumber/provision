1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,080
Leo has $4,522.08 in
his bank account.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,890
He deposits another
$875.50 and then

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,380
withdraws $300 in cash.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,300
How much is left
in his account?

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,280
So he's starting
with $4,522.08.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,830
Let's write that down.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,560
$4,522.08.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,680
And then he deposits, or he
adds, another $875.50.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,810
So he's going to add $875.50.

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,500
When you deposit into an
account, you're putting

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,090
something into the account, or
you're adding to the account.

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,270
So after he adds that $875.50,
what does he have?

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,030
We go back to the penny spot,
or we could view that as the

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,760
hundredths.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,790
A penny is one hundredth
of a dollar.

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,830
Let me switch colors.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,210
We have 8 plus 0 is 8.

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,120
0 plus 5 is 5.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,150
We have the decimal
right there.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,630
2 plus 5 is 7.

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,920
2 plus 7 is 9.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
5 plus 8 is 13.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,930
Put the 3 down here and regroup
the 1, or carry the 1.

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,710
1 plus 4 is 5.

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:26,030
So after the $875.50 deposit,
he has $5,397.58.

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,670
Then he withdraws $300 in cash,
or he takes out $300, so

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,340
we'll have to subtract that.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:43,320
So then he withdraws $300 and
I just added some trailing

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,310
zeroes after the decimal.

31
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,210
$300 is the same thing as
$300.00 and zero cents.

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,475
And then we subtract.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:53,260
   

34
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,120
8 minus 0 is 8.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,370
5 minus 0 is 5.

36
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,000
We have our decimal
right there.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
7 minus 0 is 7.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,640
9 minus 0 is 9.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,919
3 minus 3 is 0, and then 5
minus nothing here is 5.

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,830
So he's the left with, in
his account, $5,097.58.

41
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,067
