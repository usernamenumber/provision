00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:06,850
Create a graph of the linear equation 5x plus 2y is equal to 20.

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:14,002
So the line is essentially the set of all coordinate, all x's and y's that satisfy this relationship right over here.

3
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:17,890
To make things simple what we're going to do is we're going to set up a table where we're going to put a bunch of x values in

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,425
and then figure out the corresponding y value based on this relationship.

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:26,587
But to make it a little bit simpler, I'm going to solve for y here so it becomes easier to solve for y for any given x.

6
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:32,578
So we have 5x plus 2y is equal to 20.

7
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:36,246
If we want to solve for y, let's just get rid of the 5x on the left hand side,

8
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:39,915
so let's subtract 5x from both sides of this equation.

9
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,166
The left hand side, these guys cancel out.

10
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:48,506
So we get 2y is equal to the right hand side, you have 20 minus 5x.

11
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,918
And then you can divide both sides of this equation by 2.

12
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,915
So you divide both sides by 2.

13
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:59,931
The left hand side we just have a y, and then the right hand side... we kind of leave it that way.

14
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:06,850
That actually would be a pretty straight-forward way to leave it, but or we could call this 20 divided by 2 is 10 minus 5x over 2

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,844
or minus five-halves times x.

16
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:17,253
Listen, since we're using this let's just come up with a bunch of x values and see what the corresponding y values are and then just plot them.

17
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,575
So let me do this in a new color.

18
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:21,850
So let me... a slightly different shade of yellow...

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,609
So we have x values and let's think about what the corresponding y value is going to be.

20
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,467
So I'll start... well, I can start anywhere.

21
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:32,764
I'll start at x equals zero just 'cause that tends to keep things pretty simple.

22
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:43,770
If x is zero then y is equal to 10 minus five-halves times zero which is equal to five-halves times zero is just a zero.

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,185
So it's just a 10 minus zero or 10.

24
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:50,667
So that gives us the coordinate, the point, (0,10).

25
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:58,259
When x is zero, y is 10. So zero, so x is zero so it's going to be right here in the middle of the x axis.

26
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,163
And then you go up 10 for the y coordinate.

27
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:06,572
[counting] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

28
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,104
So, it's right over here.

29
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:12,067
So that's the point (0,10).

30
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:16,231
Let's do another point. Let's say that x is 2.

31
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,597
I'm going to pick multiples of two here, just so that I've got a nice, clean answer, here.

32
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:28,445
So when x is 2, then y is equal to 10 minus five-halves times 2.

33
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:33,925
And the 2 in the denominator cancels out with the 2 in the denomin... in the numerator.

34
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:37,501
So simplifies to 10 minus 5 or just 5.

35
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,848
So that tells us the point.

36
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:43,910
x equals 2, y is equal to 5 is on the line.

37
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,000
So, 2, x is equal to [counting] one, two, right over here, and y is equal to 5.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,900
We go up five.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,266
[counting] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And just like that.

40
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,938
So that's the point (2,5).

41
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:59,067
Now, when you're drawing a line, you actually just need two points.

42
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,603
Actually, if you have a ruler or any straight edge, we can just connect these two points.

43
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:08,105
And if we do it neatly, every... every point on that line should satisfy this relationship right here.

44
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,241
Just so we get practice, I'll do more points.

45
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,606
So let me do... let's say I want x is equal to 4.

46
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:19,576
Then y is equal to 10 minus five-halves times four.

47
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:24,266
This is equal to five-halves times 4, this is equal to 10, right?

48
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,563
'cause the two... divide the denominator by 2; you get 1.

49
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,667
Divide the numerator by 2, you get 2.

50
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,600
Or four over two is the same thing as 2, so it becomes 2 times 5 is 10.

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,566
10 minus 10 is a ZERO, so the point (4,0) is on our line.

52
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:46,604
So, x is [counting] 1, 2, 3, 4, and then y is zero so we don't move up at all.

53
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:50,504
So we have four... (4,0).

54
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,430
And I could keep going. I can try other points.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,933
You could do them if you like, but this is plenty. Just two of these would have been enough to draw the line.

56
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:01,333
So let me just, let me just draw it, so I'll do it in white.

57
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,111
So the line will look something like this.

58
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:12,842
The line will look something... the line will look something like... something like that.

59
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:15,267
And I can keep going in both directions.

60
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,667
So there you have it.

61
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,111
That is the graph of our linear equation.

62
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:24,777
Let me make the line, my line a little bit bolder just in case you found that first line hard to read.

63
00:04:24,777 --> 99:59:59,999
So maybe we can make it a little bit bolder. I think you get the general idea.
