00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,094
In the video where I give an overview

2
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:04,176
of American history through the Civil War,

3
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:06,004
I commented that it's unfortunate

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,014
that Abraham Lincoln is assassinated

5
00:00:08,014 --> 00:00:11,400
shortly before the end of the Civil War.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,210
And, although that is technically correct,

7
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,059
what I want to do is clarify that comment

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,611
a little bit in this video.

9
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:20,148
Because, in actuality, by the time he was assassinated,

10
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:23,775
Lincoln knew that the Union was very, very, very

11
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,029
likely to win the war -- that the major Confederate armies

12
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,252
had already surrendered to the Union.

13
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:32,440
Although it wasn't formally done,

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,596
there was still some fighting going on

15
00:00:34,596 --> 00:00:36,276
in some parts of the South.

16
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:39,960
So, if we go back to April 9th, 1865,

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,279
you have the battle at Appomattox Courthouse;

18
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:42,998
and after that battle,

19
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:46,601
the Confederate Army is essentially routed.

20
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:47,787
It has to surrender.

21
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:53,139
And this, right here, is Robert E. Lee.

22
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:56,816
And on April 9th, 1865, after that battle,

23
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:02,241
he surrenders to Ulysses S. Grant.

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,196
And one point of confusion some people often have --

25
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:06,921
and I had this the first time I learned it --

26
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,608
is that "Appomattox Courthouse" is the name of the city;

27
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:11,271
the surrender actually did not take place

28
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,211
in the courthouse in that city.

29
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,692
(And I shouldn't even call it a "city";

30
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,658
it was a little town with a handful of buildings.)

31
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:22,275
It took place in this gentleman's house: Wilmer McClean.

32
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:28,790
And I'm showing his image because his set of circumstances, or how he is tied to the Civil War,

33
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:34,533
is frankly fascinating because in 1861, the first battle of the Civil War

34
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,615
occurred on his property in Manassas, Virginia.

35
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:43,440
This is in Northern Virginia. He was sympathetic with the Confederate army.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,027
He did not like that northern Virginia was so close to the North-South border.

37
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:54,191
So, he picks up his bags and his family and he moves them down to the small town of

38
00:01:54,191 --> 00:02:00,506
Appomattox Courthouse which is in central Virginia. So, the very first

39
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:05,186
major land battle of the Civil War literally occurs on this guy's property

40
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:11,333
and the last major (or, really, the major) surrender of the Civil War

41
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,964
occurs inside this guy's house after he moves and it's all coincidence.

42
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,052
He just happened to have the nicest house near the battlefield,

43
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:24,800
where everyone felt that it was appropriate to have this kind of major end to a major war.

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,067
But regardless, that happens on April 9th, 1865, [and] the major Confederate army surrenders to the Union army.

45
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:40,856
The reason why this is not the formal end of the Civil War is that if you still had 175,000 Confederate

46
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:46,052
troops [at] other places in the South, continuing to fight on. You have to remember that we didn't have a

47
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:51,379
telephone at this point in time, so we didn't have instant communication. So, these people who were fighting,

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:59,133
many of them did not even know that the Confederate army had already surrendered to the Union. But to

49
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:04,544
some degree, this major surrender is what leads to Lincoln's assassination,

50
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:12,159
because this was-- for most people, this tells you, "Hey, there's a 99.9% chance that the Union has

51
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,200
won. Either these people need find out their major army has surrendered or the Union has to go and essentially

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:27,842
force all of the rest of the armies to surrender. So, you go to April 14th, 1865: Lincoln already knows that

53
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:32,333
Robert E. Lee's army has surrendered; he knows that victory is imminent.

54
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:45,600
But, you have this gentleman right over here: John Wilkes Booth, who is sympathetic to the Confederate

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:53,867
cause, and in his mind, all is not lost yet. He does see this as a major blow to the Confederate cause,

56
00:03:53,867 --> 00:04:00,779
and he thinks that they need to do something desperate if they want to have any chance of being able

57
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:04,492
to come back, [or] being able to maintain their independence from the Union.

58
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:10,959
So, he coordinates with a couple of his buddies, and he says, "Hey, our only chance is if we assassinate not

59
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,133
only Abraham Lincoln but also Andrew Johnson who is the Vice-President,

60
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:22,995
and Ulysses S. Grant. And we assassinate Seward who is the Secretary of State."

61
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:28,733
And, the idea there is if you assassinate everyone who is in line to become President, it would just

62
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:34,329
throw the entire Union leadership in disarray, and maybe it would give these characters over here a fighting

63
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:38,585
chance to maintain their independence, or maybe come back against the Union army.

64
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:45,800
Unfortunately, for John Wilkes Booth (or, I guess-- well, you could take it either way), the other three people

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,133
were not able to fully execute on their plan. Seward was injured; he actually did get stabbed

66
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:57,087
in the face and all that, but he was not assassinated. And John Wilkes Booth was the

67
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:02,031
only person who was able to carry out his assassination. So, you have on

68
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:07,287
April 14th, 1865, shortly after 10:00 p.m., Abraham Lincoln is watching a play

69
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:12,333
at Ford's Theatre, and his booth-- the guy who was supposed to guard the booth

70
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:17,067
was out drinking with his buddies. So, I guess the Secret Service really--

71
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:22,046
the security was not, back then, what it is now (hopefully, what it is now).

72
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:25,533
And John Wilkes Booth, who actually used to act at this theatre,

73
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,800
picked a time in the play where everyone would laugh and clap, and he said, "Hey, I'll just

74
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,733
shoot right then; people would think it's part of the play or something, or they wouldn't notice as much,

75
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:38,733
and then I'll be able to run out." And so he is able to, right at that moment

76
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:45,882
shortly after 10:00 p.m., shoot Abraham Lincoln and assassinate him on April 14th, 1865.

77
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:51,882
But, the whole point here is to just understand that Lincoln did know that Robert E. Lee's army

78
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:58,102
had surrendered at the time of his assassination. So, he was at least feeling pretty good

79
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,625
about the course of the war.
