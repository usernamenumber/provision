1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,730
Welcome back. I think I was rushing that problem.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,700
So let me just make it clear again,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,620
just so you don't get confused,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,820
because I was trying to get under that 10-minute limit.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,580
But they want to know what the perimeter of this red is,

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,080
right?

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
That's kind of the outside of this thing that looks like

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,880
a flower or something.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,480
And what I'm saying is that the perimeter of the red part

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,840
is equivalent to the sum of the perimeters of the rectangle

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,940
of the triangle,

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,630
sorry-- the sum of the perimeters of the triangles.

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,700
But if I were just to take the sum of the perimeters of the

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,440
triangle, I wouldn't just be getting the red part.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,090
I'd also be getting in these parts, right?

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,060
Because those are parts of the perimeters of the triangles.

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,000
So if I want just the red part,I subtract out this,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,110
what I just drew in blue,

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,460
and the blue is the perimeter of that inside square.

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,190
And the perimeter of that inside square is 9plus 9plus 9plus9

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,030
or 36.

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,040
So I just take the perimeter of all four triangles.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,020
Each of them has a perimeter of 30, so together they have a

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,330
perimeter of 120, and then subtract out the perimeter of

25
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,740
the square inside, which has a perimeter of 36.

26
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:09,310
So 120 minus 36 is what? 84. Right, 84. That's choice D.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,540
Next problem.

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,220
Let me remember that this is where I ended the last one.

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,890
OK, next problem. Problem number 13.

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,390
The graph of g of x is shown above.

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,050
OK, I'd better draw it because they want us to essentially

32
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,550
look at the graph and figure out a value.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,890
Well, let's see, it starts at roughly-- so if I were to--

34
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:54,070
let's see, 2, 4, 6, 8. And we have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll try my best to draw it like they have. So the line

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,070
starts roughly a little bit above 6, not even up to 7.

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,010
And then, where does it go? It goes to like 4.

38
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,090
Oh my God, I thought I was using the line tool.

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,570
It starts a little bit above 6, not even up to 7.

40
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,810
It looks like about at 1. It starts here,

41
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,360
then it goes to the point 4 comma 2, it looks like.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,010
And then it goes from 4 comma 2 to 6 comma 3, roughly.

43
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,030
Or maybe even exactly. 6 comma 3.

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,050
And then it looks like it goes to 8 comma 8.

45
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,030
8 comma 8 is like there, roughly. That's about right.

46
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,620
And then it goes down to like-I don't know--almost 11 comma 2

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,640
It goes to someplace like that,

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,000
and they're saying this is the graph of g of x.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,430
And they're saying, if g of 2 is equal to k,

50
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,690
which of the following could be the value of g of k?

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,750
g of k is what?So what could k equal?Let's figure out g of 2.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,000
So when x is 2, bum, bum, bum,bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,510
what is y equal to?

54
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,020
Well, it looks pretty darn close to 5, if not exactly 5.

55
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:26,000
So k is equal to 5, right? g of 2 is equal to 5, right?

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,170
And they want to know what g of k is.

57
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,520
Well, we figured out that k is equal 5,

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,500
so now we want to know what g of 5 is. So we go to 5.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,010
We go, bup, bup,bup, bup, bup. This is 5.

60
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,030
And then we go bup, bup, bup,bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,000
Looks pretty close to 3. g of 5

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,030
and actually the way they drew it,it doesn't look close to 3.

63
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,490
The way they drew it, if you look at where 5 is, it looks

64
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,580
actually less than 3. It looks like 2 and 1/2, actually,

65
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,000
the way they drew it. My drawing is a little off.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,490
So if you look down, look at the x value.

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,120
When x is equal to 5, you go up to the graph, it looks like

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,520
the graph value there is right around 2 and 1/2.

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,070
So I should say this is 2 and 1/2.

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,000
And that is one of the choices, B. Next problem.

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,190
Problem 14.

72
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,520
If 0 is less than or equal to x,which is less than or equal

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:35,200
to 8, and negative 1 is less than equal to y, which is less

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,700
than or equal to 3, which of the following gives the set of

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,940
all possible values of x times y?

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
OK, so we really just want to figure out

77
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,940
how low can x times y be and how high can x times y be?

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,160
Well, what's the lowest possible value for x times y?

79
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,840
Well, if we make y negative, and we make x really big, or

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,090
as big as it can be, if x is 8 and y is negative 1,

81
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,010
then that is the lowest value for x times y I can think of.

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,040
So xy is going to be greater than or equal to negative 8

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,420
because when you take a negative number,

84
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,860
you want the other number to be

85
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,110
as big as possible so you get a large negative number.

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,930
And it's going to be less than or equal to

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,370
well, what's the largest number that I can think of?

88
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,830
Well, if I take 8 and I multiply it times the large

89
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,010
value of y and this is a positive value, then I get 24.

90
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,230
So xy is going to be greater than or equal to negative 8

91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,610
and less than or equal to 24. And that is choice E.

92
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,490
And once again, how did I get negative 8?

93
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,550
This is probably the part that's not intuitive for you.

94
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,700
It's because-- I mean, your instinct might have said the

95
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,440
minimum x is 0, right?

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,580
So I'll take 0 times any of these, so this is going to be 0.

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,960
But, you can actually get a smaller value for xy by using

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,310
negative 1 and 8, so that's where we got the negative 8 from.

99
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:24,040
Next question. 15. Switch colors. 15. Let me draw that.

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,710
It looks like a line there, line there, line there,

101
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,910
then there's another line that goes like that.

102
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,950
And they write that this is n degrees right there.

103
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,540
In the figure above, what is this sum in terms of n of the

104
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,620
degree measures of the four angles marked with arrows?

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
Fascinating.

106
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,910
So they want to know that plus that plus that plus that.

107
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,500
Well, let's just do the angle game.

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,490
If this angle as n, well, then this angle is n, right?

109
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,020
Let me switch colors. What is this angle here?

110
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,070
Well, it's supplementary to n, so this is 180 minus n.

111
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,440
And so is this.This is also 180 minus n.

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,030
And so what are these? What's the sum of these two angles?

113
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:26,010
Let me call this a, b. What's the sum of a plus b?

114
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,770
Well, we know that a plus b plus this angle,

115
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:37,390
plus 180 minus n is equal to 180, right?

116
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,520
Because they're all in the same triangle.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,770
So a plus b is equal to 180 minus 180 plus n.

118
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,840
I just took this and subtracted 180 and added n to both sides

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,310
This cancels out so you get a plus b is equal to n.

120
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,470
And similarly, if you had c,if this were c and d,

121
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,140
you could do the same thing.

122
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:07,000
c plus d plus this angle, 180 minus n is equal to 180

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,480
because they're all in the same triangle.

124
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,010
Subtract 180 from both sides and then add n to both sides.

125
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,550
You get c plus d is equal to n.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,690
So if you want to know what a plus b plus c plus d is,

127
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,370
a plus b is n, c plus d is n,

128
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,070
so the whole thing is going to be n plus n or 2n.

129
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,710
And that is choice B.

130
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,270
Let's see if I have time to do problem 16,

131
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:43,050
considering I have a little under a minute left. Problem 16.

132
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,090
After the first term, each term in a sequence

133
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,870
actually, this is going to be-- I think this will take some

134
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,000
explanation, so I'll do 16 in a video by itself.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,090
I'll see you in the next video.
