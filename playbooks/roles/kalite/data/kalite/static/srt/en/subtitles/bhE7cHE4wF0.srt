1
00:00:07,026 --> 00:00:08,572
We're here in the British Museum and

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,162
we're looking at the head of Augustus

3
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:12,700
from about 27 or 25 B.C.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,697
So, who's Augustus?

5
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:16,828
Well, Augustus of course became the first emperor.

6
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:18,202
He, of course, was of the triumvirates.

7
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:19,487
Lots of people know the stories of

8
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,163
Mark Antony and Cleopatra through Shakespeare, etc.

9
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:25,324
And, of course, he defeated Antony at the Battle of Actium

10
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,533
and that was when he was able to assume the position.

11
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,301
He didn't become "Augustus" until later on

12
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,912
when he finally defeated all the other rivals.

13
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,911
So he goes from being Octavian

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:36,339
who's one of three in charge of Rome,

15
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,708
to defeating his rivals including Antony.

16
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,891
And he's given the name Augustus,

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,312
it's an honor that the Senate has given to him.

18
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,272
And with that, is a shift, he's saying

19
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:46,745
well, this a change from the past now.

20
00:00:46,745 --> 00:00:49,003
He can't do the same kind of promoting himself

21
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,596
in the ways he had before, in battle,

22
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:53,233
struggling against the other people that wanted to rule.

23
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,706
So, here, he's saying, well, I'm the ruler now

24
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,578
and I'm changing the propaganda.

25
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:59,854
Going back to looking at this statue in front of us.

26
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:04,192
It's not necessarily the kind of "empire-builder"

27
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,492
that we would imagine.

28
00:01:05,492 --> 00:01:06,789
This is quite stripped down, I mean,

29
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,420
he's a young man,

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,392
he's got a kind of contemplative look,

31
00:01:10,392 --> 00:01:12,246
he never seems to be meeting your eye

32
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,392
no matter where you stand.

33
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,362
I've walked around him a few times and

34
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:15,552
he won't look me in the eye.

35
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:16,963
But he has these very piercing eyes

36
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:18,572
which are actually made out of glass.

37
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:21,760
So they really stand out from the dark bronze.

38
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,148
That's something you see on other antique sculptures as well.

39
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:28,029
This is really well preserved with a lot of detail

40
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,733
for something that is so old.

41
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,067
And the fact that it is bronze is extremely unusual.

42
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,962
Because, of course, not many bronze figures

43
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:35,490
would have lasted from antiquity.

44
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,000
Because people usually would have melted the metal down,

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,713
and used it for another purpose.

46
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:41,021
And there's this fabulous story about

47
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,359
why this particular head is so well preserved,

48
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,900
which is that it was actually part of a statue

49
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,433
that was put up in Egypt.

50
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,580
And at one point the Kush empire,

51
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,914
the enemies of the Romans,

52
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:55,127
who were in charge of Egypt at the time, invaded.

53
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:57,053
They knocked down the statue and took it away.

54
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:59,023
And it was sort of like a "haha",

55
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:00,554
thumb your nose at the Roman Empire

56
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,477
by burying the head of the emperor.

57
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,567
And cutting the head off of the statue

58
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,425
is symbolic of cutting the power,

59
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:09,667
the source of power of the emperor himself.

60
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,202
And what they did with it was very unusual.

61
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,094
They buried it underneath the temple

62
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:14,167
where they worshipped,

63
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,659
so they were actually all standing on his head

64
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,305
and treading on him whenever they went to worship.

65
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,872
It's a good way of tramping him under their feet,

66
00:02:20,872 --> 00:02:22,931
always reminding him, you know, you're beneath us.

67
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:24,405
The thing that strikes me about this is

68
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,354
he's portraying himself in a very specific way obviously.

69
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:30,916
And there's this connection to Alexander the Great

70
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:34,047
through the youth, and the tousled hair.

71
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,027
And of course, Alexander the Great

72
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:39,359
being the ultimate role model for young military genius.

73
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,993
And this is clearly a tradition

74
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,900
that Augustus is tapping into here.

75
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,676
But he's also giving himself

76
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:47,497
quite a bit of dignity with this portrayal.

77
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,333
He's got the slightly furrowed brow,

78
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:53,033
but just enough to imply a focus, not a worry.

79
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,738
That's interesting because at this time

80
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:55,737
when he's creating this new image,

81
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,613
he's trying to create a shift in society.

82
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,036
He didn't want to be warring and fighting senators

83
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:03,216
trying to up themselves and promote their own prowess.

84
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,780
He's bringing it back to moral outlook down to the individual,

85
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,286
and he took the name of Princeps.

86
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:09,975
He's the first amongst equals.

87
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:11,819
And he tried to lead by example,

88
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,452
talking about family values.

89
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:15,177
And the imagery he took on,

90
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:16,849
he was promoting that as well.

91
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:18,167
It's interesting to talk about his youth.

92
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,567
because he used this image until he died.

93
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,346
So he died I think at 76 for something like that

94
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,285
and he never got another wrinkle or anything.

95
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,287
So the idea of the State Portrait in Britain,

96
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,585
there's the images of Queen Elizabeth everywhere.

97
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,371
We age her, on our coins,

98
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:33,969
we aged her every twenty or forty years or so.

99
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:34,933
she would be put a couple more wrinkles

100
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,902
and made a bit fatter.

101
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,559
Not so much with Augustus,

102
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,807
and then every emperor afterwards took that approach.

103
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,179
So they could have maybe depicted themselves

104
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,145
as an old person

105
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,301
but they would never age themselves

106
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,207
any further than their original image.

107
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,606
It's also worth remembering that

108
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:49,329
what had come before this was the Roman Republic.

109
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,756
The Senate, and the idea was that

110
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:54,454
Roman citizens had a say and voted on things.

111
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:58,254
And this is Augustus who's breaking from that mode

112
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:00,164
and making it an empire.

113
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:01,606
So he's the first amongst equals

114
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:04,297
trying to connect back to that republic idea

115
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:06,915
but also putting himself slightly over it.

116
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,729
And this is slightly bigger than life size,

117
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:13,162
so he would have been a little bit bigger than anybody.

118
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,306
But he was everywhere,

119
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,161
this image would have been everywhere.

120
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:19,431
And it was in towns as far, you know, .... Egypt,

121
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:22,190
like the furthest corner of the empire at that time.

122
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,483
And the statue actually stood in for the emperor himself.

123
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:26,729
so he would be able to preside over court

124
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,633
hearings and pass judgements in his presence in the statue.

125
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:34,709
So the idea of imbuing the statue with a bit of the personality

126
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,251
of the person that it is portraying,

127
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,819
and the power that dwells inside the statue.

128
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,258
And of course we don't know what he looks like

129
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,610
But this is a quite realistic-seeming portrayal,

130
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,458
a man could look like that

131
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,033
he's quite attractive, very sympathetic,

132
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,600
he looks like someone who'd give you a fair trial.

133
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,586
And the fact that the head has been moved

134
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:52,571
from the statue by the Kush,

135
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,566
they are attacking that power,they're attacking the statue.

136
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:56,567
And remember that statue is Augustus

137
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:57,494
in all intents and purposes

138
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:58,625
and they managed to behead him

139
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,767
So unfortunately for him,

140
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,310
he had his head cut off on that statue.

141
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,579
But lucky for us,

142
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,971
because it's been preserved in the sands of Egypt.
