1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,660
SAL: Everything we've been
dealing with so far in our

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,410
journey through chemistry has
revolved around stability of

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,420
electrons and where electrons
would rather

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,340
be in stable shells.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,030
And like all things in life,
if you explore the atom a

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,400
little further you'll realize
that electrons are not the

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,250
only stuff that's going
on in an atom.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,250
That the nucleus itself has some
interactions, or has some

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,140
instability, that needs to
be relieved in some way.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,740
That's what we'll talk
a little bit

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,420
about in this video.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,110
And actually the mechanics of
it are well out of the scope

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,450
of a first-year chemistry
course, but it's good to at

15
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,570
least know that it occurs.

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,110
And one day when we study the
strong nuclear force, and

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,570
quantum physics, and all the
like, then we can start

18
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,280
talking about exactly why these
protons and neutrons,

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,810
and their constituent quarks
are interacting

20
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,530
the way they do.

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,500
But with that said, let's
at least think about the

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,890
different types of ways that a
nucleus can essentially decay.

23
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,880
So let's say I have a
bunch of protons.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,830
I'll just draw a couple here.

25
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,590
Some protons there, and I'll
draw some neutrons.

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,430
And I'll draw them in
a neutral-ish color.

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,780
Maybe let me see, like a
grayish would be good.

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,520
So let me just draw some
neutrons here.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,020
How many protons do I have?

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,300
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,410
I'll do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9 neutrons.

32
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,870
And so let's say this is the
nucleus of our atom.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,960
And remember-- and this is, you
know, in the very first

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,860
video I made about the atom--
the nucleus, if you actually

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,320
were to draw an actual atom--
and it's actually very hard to

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,440
drawn an atom because it has
no well-defined boundaries.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,050
The electron really could be,
you know, at any given moment,

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,980
it could be anywhere.

39
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,740
But if you were to say, OK,
where is 90% of the time the

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,700
electron is going to be in?

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,680
You'd say, that's the radius,
or that's the

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,750
diameter of our atom.

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,530
We learned in that very first
video that the nucleus is

44
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,450
almost an infinitesimal portion
of the volume of this

45
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,340
sphere where the electron
will be 90% of the time.

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,080
And the neat takeaway there
was that, well, most of

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,280
whatever we look at in life
is just open free space.

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,030
All of this is just
open space.

49
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,400
But I just want to repeat
that because that little

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,660
infinitesimal spot that we
talked about before, where

51
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,320
even though it's a very small
part of the fraction of the

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,030
volume of an atom-- it's
actually almost all of its

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,890
mass-- that's what I'm zooming
out to this point here.

54
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,240
These aren't atoms, these
aren't electrons.

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,580
We're zoomed into the nucleus.

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,040
And so it turns out that
sometimes the nucleus is a

57
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,650
little bit unstable, and it
wants to get to a more stable

58
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,400
configuration.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
We're not going to go into the
mechanics of exactly what

60
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,700
defines an unstable nucleus
and all that.

61
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,880
But in order to get into a
more unstable nucleus,

62
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,820
sometimes it emits what's called
an alpha particle, or

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,470
this is called alpha decay.

64
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:04,440
Alpha decay.

65
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,220
And it emits an alpha particle,

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,160
which sounds very fancy.

67
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,450
It's just a collection of
neutrons and protons.

68
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,690
So an alpha particle is two
neutrons and two protons.

69
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,850
So maybe these guys, they just
didn't feel like they'd fit in

70
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,110
just right, so they're a
collection right here.

71
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,740
And they get emitted.

72
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,070
They leave the nucleus.

73
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,870
So let's just think what
happens to an atom when

74
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,050
something like that happens.

75
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,500
So let's just say I have some
random element, I'll just call

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,310
it element E.

77
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,020
Let's say it has p, protons.

78
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,660
Actually let me do it in the
color of my protons.

79
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,800
It has p, protons.

80
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,550
And then it has its atomic mass
number, is the number of

81
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,510
protons plus the number
of neutrons.

82
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,480
And do the neutrons
in gray, right?

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,590
So when it experiences
alpha decay, what

84
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,180
happens to the element?

85
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,890
Well, its protons are going
to decrease by two.

86
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,040
So its protons are going
to be p minus 2.

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,450
And then its neutrons are also
going to decrease by two.

88
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,320
So its mass number's going
to decrease by four.

89
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,100
So up here you'll have p minus
2, plus our neutrons minus 2,

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,940
so we're going to
have minus 4.

91
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,080
So your mass is going to
decrease by four, and you're

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,700
actually going to turn
to a new element.

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,710
Remember, your elements
were defined by

94
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,250
the number of protons.

95
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,630
So in this alpha decay, when
you're losing two neutrons and

96
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,300
two protons, but especially the
protons are going to make

97
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,460
you into a different element.

98
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,860
So if we call this element 1,
I'm just going to call it,

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,590
we're going to be a different
element now, element 2.

100
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,050
And if you think about what's
generated, we're emitting

101
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,600
something that has two protons,

102
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,340
and it has two neutrons.

103
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,740
So that its mass is going to be
the mass of the two protons

104
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,790
and two neutrons.

105
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,830
So what are we emitting?

106
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,810
We're emitting something that
has a mass of four.

107
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,170
So if you look at, what is two
protons and two neutrons?

108
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,740
I actually don't have the
periodic table on my

109
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:14,880
[? head. ?]

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,020
I forgot to cut and paste
it before this video.

111
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,680
But it doesn't take you long on
the periodic table to find

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
an element that has two protons,
and that's helium.

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,590
It actually has an atomic
mass of four.

114
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,390
So this is actually a helium
nucleus that gets emitted with

115
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,080
alpha decay.

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,875
This is actually a
helium nucleus.

117
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,010
   

118
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,170
And because it's a helium
nucleus and it has no

119
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,420
electrons to bounce off its two
protons, this would be a

120
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,950
helium ion.

121
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,490
So essentially it has
no electrons.

122
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,830
It has two protons so it
has a plus 2 charge.

123
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,350
   

124
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,110
So an alpha particle is really
just a helium ion, a plus 2

125
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,960
charged helium ion that is
spontaneously emitted by a

126
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,780
nucleus just to get to
a more stable state.

127
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,670
Now that's one type of decay.

128
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,850
Let's explore the other ones.

129
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,050
So let me draw another
nucleus here.

130
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,640
I'll draw some neutrons.

131
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,310
I'll just draw some protons.

132
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,200
   

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,920
So it turns out sometimes that
a neutron doesn't feel

134
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,710
comfortable with itself.

135
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,710
It looks at what the protons do
on a daily basis and says,

136
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,560
you know what?

137
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,780
For some reason when I look into
my heart, I feel like I

138
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,220
really should be a proton.

139
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,640
If I were a proton, the entire
nucleus would be a little bit

140
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,870
more stable.

141
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,860
And so what it does is, to
become a proton-- remember, a

142
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,180
neutron has neutral charge.

143
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,060
So what it does is, it
emits an electron.

144
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,070
And I know you're saying, Sal,
you know, that's crazy, I

145
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,760
didn't even know neutrons
had electrons in

146
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,900
them, and all of that.

147
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,050
And I agree with you.

148
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,810
It is crazy.

149
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,750
And one day we'll study
all of what exists

150
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,540
inside of the nucleus.

151
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,880
But let's just say that it
can emit an electron.

152
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,206
So this emits an electron.

153
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,730
   

154
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,460
And we signify that with its--
roughly its mass is zero.

155
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,830
We know an electron really
doesn't have a zero mass, but

156
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,970
we're talking about
atomic mass units.

157
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,130
If the proton is one, an
electron is 1/1,836 of that.

158
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,940
So we just round it.

159
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,250
We say it has a mass of zero.

160
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,380
Its mass really isn't zero.

161
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,670
And its charge is minus 1.

162
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,370
It's atomic, you can kind
of say its atomic

163
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,200
number's minus 1.

164
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,570
So it emits an electron.

165
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,760
And by emitting an electron,
instead of being neutral, now

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,020
it turns into a proton.

167
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,490
   

168
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,090
And so this is called
beta decay.

169
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,500
   

170
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,780
And a beta particle is really
just that emitted electron.

171
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,480
So let's go back to our little
case of an element.

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,940
It has some number of protons,
and then it has

173
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,980
some number of neutrons.

174
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,340
So you have the protons and
the neutrons, then you get

175
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,660
your mass number.

176
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,480
When it experiences beta
decay, what happens?

177
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,490
Well, are the protons changed?

178
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,890
Sure, we have one more proton
than we had before.

179
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,500
Because our neutron
changed into one.

180
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,410
So now our protons are plus 1.

181
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,186
Has our mass number changed?

182
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,720
Well let's see.

183
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,750
The neutrons goes down
by one but your

184
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,365
protons go up to by one.

185
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,380
So your mass number
will not change.

186
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,789
So it's still going
to be p plus N.

187
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,909
so your mass stays the same,
unlike the situation with

188
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,679
alpha decay, but your
element changes.

189
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,039
Your number of protons
changes.

190
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,975
So now, once again, you're
dealing with a new element in

191
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,470
beta decay.

192
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,530
Now, let's say we have
the other situation.

193
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:57,360
Let's say we have a situation
where one of these protons

194
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,750
looks at the neutrons and
says, you know what?

195
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,240
I see how they live.

196
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,170
It's very appealing to me.

197
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:13,910
I think I would fit in better,
and our community of particles

198
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,660
within the nucleus would
be happier if

199
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,160
I too were a neutron.

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,770
We'd all be in a more
stable condition.

201
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,660
So what they do is, that little
uncomfortable proton

202
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,340
has some probability of
emitting-- and now this is a

203
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,020
new idea to you-- a positron,
not a proton.

204
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,070
It emits a positron.

205
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,670
And what's a positron?

206
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,390
It's something that
has the exact

207
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,610
same mass as an electron.

208
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,890
So it's 1/1836 of the
mass of a proton.

209
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,200
But we just write a zero there
because in atomic mass units

210
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,830
it's pretty close to zero.

211
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,006
But it has a positive charge.

212
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,720
And it's a little confusing,
because they'll

213
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,630
still write e there.

214
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,440
Whenever I see an e, I
think an electron.

215
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,720
But no, they say e because it's
kind of like the same

216
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,500
type of particle, but instead
of having a negative charge,

217
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,830
it has a positive charge.

218
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,080
This is a positron.

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,980
   

220
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,450
And now we're starting to get
kind of exotic with the types

221
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,210
of particles and stuff
we're dealing with.

222
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,730
But this does happen.

223
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,920
And if you have a proton that
emits this particle, that

224
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,370
pretty much had all of its
positive charge going with it,

225
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:26,330
this proton turns
into a neutron.

226
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,160
And that is called positron
emission.

227
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,350
Positron emission is usually
pretty easy to figure out what

228
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,510
it is, because they call
it positron emission.

229
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,880
So if we start with the same E,
it has a certain number of

230
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,500
protons, and a certain
number of neutrons.

231
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,190
What's the new element
going to be?

232
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,060
Well it's going to lose
a proton. p minus 1.

233
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,770
And that's going to be turned
into a neutron.

234
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,620
So p is going to
go down by one.

235
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,030
N is going to go up by one.

236
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,020
So that the mass of the whole
atom isn't going to change.

237
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,550
So it's going to be p plus N.

238
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,500
But we're still going to have
a different element, right?

239
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,230
When we had beta decay,
we increased

240
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,150
the number of protons.

241
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,700
So we went, kind of, to the
right in the periodic table or

242
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,070
we increased our, well,
you get the idea.

243
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,440
When we do positron emission,
we decreased

244
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,700
our number of protons.

245
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,300
And actually I should
write that here in

246
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,510
both of these reactions.

247
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,460
So this is the positron
emission, and I'm left over

248
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,060
with one positron.

249
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,430
And in our beta decay, I'm left
over with one electron.

250
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,670
They're written the
exact same way.

251
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,660
You know this is an electron
because it's a minus 1 charge.

252
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,890
You know this is a positron
because it

253
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,810
has a plus 1 charge.

254
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,170
Now there's one last
type of decay that

255
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,140
you should know about.

256
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,810
But it doesn't change the number
of protons or neutrons

257
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,970
in a nucleus.

258
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,940
But it just releases a ton of
energy, or sometimes, you

259
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,350
know, a high-energy proton.

260
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,160
And that's called gamma decay.

261
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,510
And gamma decay means that these
guys just reconfigure

262
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,795
themselves.

263
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,460
Maybe they get a little
bit closer.

264
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,990
And by doing that they release
energy in the form of a very

265
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,180
high wavelength electromagnetic
wave. Which is

266
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,820
essentially a gamma, you could
either call it a gamma

267
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,230
particle or gamma ray.

268
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,450
And it's very high energy.

269
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,720
Gamma rays are something you
don't want to be around.

270
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,460
They're very likely
to maybe kill you.

271
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,130
Everything we did, I've said
is a little theoretical.

272
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's do some actual problems,
and figure out what type of

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,750
decay we're dealing with.

274
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,400
So here I have 7-beryllium
where seven

275
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,900
is its atomic mass.

276
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,520
And I have it being converted
to 7-lithium So

277
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
what's going on here?

278
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,000
My beryllium, my nuclear mass
is staying the same, but I'm

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,240
going from four protons
to three protons.

280
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,130
So I'm reducing my number
of protons.

281
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,840
My overall mass hasn't
changed.

282
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,100
So it's definitely
not alpha decay.

283
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,960
Alpha decay was, you know,
you're releasing a whole

284
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,770
helium from the nucleus.

285
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,960
So what am I releasing?

286
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,410
I'm kind of releasing one
positive charge, or I'm

287
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,560
releasing a positron.

288
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,940
And actually I have this
here in this equation.

289
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,040
This is a positron.

290
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,140
So this type of decay of
7-beryllium to 7-lithium is

291
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,760
positron emission.

292
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,830
Fair enough.

293
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,400
Now let's look at
the next one.

294
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,870
We have uranium-238 decaying
to thorium-234.

295
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,140
And we see that the atomic mass
is decreasing by 4, minus

296
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,910
4, and you see that your atomic
numbers decrease, or

297
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,270
your protons are decreasing,
by 2.

298
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,810
So you must be releasing,
essentially, something that

299
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,390
has an atomic mass of four,
and a atomic number

300
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,680
of two, or a helium.

301
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,210
So this is alpha decay.

302
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,100
So this right here is
an alpha particle.

303
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,400
And this is an example
of alpha decay.

304
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,110
Now you're probably saying, hey
Sal, wait, something weird

305
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,850
is happening here.

306
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,630
Because if I just go from 92
protons to 90 protons, I still

307
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,430
have my 92 electrons out here.

308
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,750
So wouldn't I now have
a minus 2 charge?

309
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,270
And even better, this helium I'm
releasing, it doesn't have

310
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,090
any electrons with it.

311
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,390
It's just a helium nucleus.

312
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,700
So doesn't that have
a plus 2 charge?

313
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,180
And if you said that, you would
be absolutely correct.

314
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,510
But the reality is that right
when this decay happens, this

315
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,290
thorium, it has no reason
to hold on to those two

316
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,050
electrons, so those two
electrons disappear and

317
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,840
thorium becomes neutral again.

318
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,480
And this helium, likewise,
it is very quick.

319
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
It really wants two electrons
to get stable, so it's very

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
quick to grab two electrons out
of wherever it's bumping

321
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,460
into, and so that
becomes stable.

322
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,305
So you could write
it either way.

323
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:42,250
Now let's do another one.

324
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,500
So here I have iodine.

325
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,820
   

326
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,670
Let's see what's happening.

327
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,020
My mass is not changing.

328
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,790
So I must just have protons
turning into neutrons or

329
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,560
neutrons turning into protons.

330
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,810
And I see here that I
have 53 protons, and

331
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,800
now I have 54 protons.

332
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,060
So a neutron must have
turned into a proton.

333
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,830
A neutron must have
gone to a proton.

334
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,160
And the way that a neutron
goes to a proton is by

335
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,620
releasing an electron.

336
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,360
And we see that in this
reaction right here.

337
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
An electron has been released.

338
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,130
And so this is beta decay.

339
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,380
This is a beta particle.

340
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,580
   

341
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,750
And that same logic holds.

342
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,780
You're like, hey wait, I just
went from 53 to 54 protons.

343
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,440
Now that I have this extra
proton, won't I have a

344
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,750
positive charge here?

345
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,480
Well you would.

346
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,810
But very quickly this might--
probably won't get these exact

347
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,740
electrons, there's so many
electrons running around-- but

348
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,950
it'll grab some electrons from
some place to get stable, and

349
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,080
then it'll be stable again.

350
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,890
But you're completely right in
thinking, hey, wouldn't it be

351
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,690
an ion for some small
amount of time?

352
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,900
Now let's do one more.

353
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,210
So we have to 222-radon-- it
has atomic number of 86--

354
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,720
going to 218-polonium, with
atomic number of 84.

355
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,540
And this actually is an
interesting aside.

356
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,380
Polonium is named after Poland,
because Marie Curie,

357
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,220
she-- At the time Poland, this
was at the turn of the last

358
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,120
century, around the end of the
1800's, Poland didn't exist as

359
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,910
a separate country.

360
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,540
It was split between Prussia,
Russia, and Austria.

361
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,590
And they really wanted let
people know that, hey, you

362
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,000
know, we think we're
one people.

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,170
So they discovered that when,
you know, radon decayed it

364
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,730
formed this element.

365
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,430
And they named it after their
motherland, after Poland.

366
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,880
It's the privileges of
discovering new elements.

367
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,090
But anyway, back
to the problem.

368
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,930
So what happened?

369
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,210
Our atomic mass went
down by four.

370
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,430
Our atomic number went
down by two.

371
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,580
Once again, we must have
released a helium particle.

372
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,070
A helium nucleus, something
that has an atomic mass of

373
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,160
four, and an atomic
number of two.

374
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,100
And so there we are.

375
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,950
So this is alpha decay.

376
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,810
We could write this as
a helium nucleus.

377
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,145
So it has no electrons.

378
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,820
We could even say immediately
that this would have a

379
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,990
negative charge, but
then it loses
