1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,644
What we're now going to think about is 
finding the differences between sets.

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:08,236
The first way that we will denote this is we'll start with set A

3
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:12,952
I've already defined set A here

4
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,846
and in both cases I have defined the sets with numbers.

5
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:22,298
Instead of having numbers as being the objects in the sets I could have had farm animals or famous presidents

6
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:25,099
but numbers will hopefully keep things fairly simple

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:27,032
so I'm going to start with set A

8
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:32,593
and from set A I'm going to subtract set B.

9
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:35,566
This is one way of thinking about the 
difference between set A and set B.

10
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:38,592
When I've written it this way, this essentially says,

11
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:45,767
"Give me the set of all of the objects that are in A with the things that are in B taken out of that set."

12
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,365
So let's think about what that means.

13
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:50,698
So what's in set A with the things that are in B taken out?

14
00:00:50,698 --> 00:01:00,008
That means, let's take set A and take out the 17, 19, and 6

15
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:04,926
so we're going to be left with the 5, 3,

16
00:01:04,926 --> 00:01:12,433
we're not going to have the 17 because we subtracted out set B, so take out anything that is in set B.

17
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:17,433
You get the 5, 3, 12 (12 is not in set B so we can keep that in there)

18
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:22,298
and then the 19 is in set B so we're going to take out the 19 as well.

19
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:29,366
So this right over here, you could view it as set B subtracted from set A.

20
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,675
One way of thinking about it, as we just said

21
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:37,175
these are all of the elements that 
are in set A that are not in set B.

22
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,098
Another way you could think about it is

23
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,503
these are all of the elements that are 
not in set B but also in set A.

24
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,925
Let me make this clear.

25
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:54,435
You could view this as B subtracted from A

26
00:01:54,435 --> 00:02:15,177
or you could view this as the 
"relative complement of set B in A".

27
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,702
We're going to talk a lot more 
about complements in the future

28
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:20,757
but the complement is the things that are not in B.

29
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:31,101
This is saying, "What are all of the things 
not in B but are in A?"

30
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,031
If you said all of the things that aren't in B

31
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:38,836
then you're thinking about all of the numbers in the whole universe that aren't 17, 19, or 6

32
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,692
and actually you can even think broader, not even just thinking about numbers.

33
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:47,525
The colour orange is not in set B so that would
be in the absolute complement of B.

34
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,941
I don't see a zebra here in set B 
so that would be its complement.

35
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,109
But we're saying, what are all of the things 
that are not in B but are in A?

36
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:58,899
That would be the numbers 5, 3, and 12.

37
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:03,634
When we visualize this as B subtracted 
from A you might be saying

38
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:11,910
"I can imagine you took the 17 and 19 out, but what about taking the 6 out? Shouldn't you have taken the six out?"

39
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,993
In traditional subtraction maybe we might have ended up with a negative number or something.

40
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:20,409
When you subtract a set, if the set you're subtracting from does not have that element

41
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,096
then taking that element out of it doesn't change it.

42
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:28,828
If I start with set A and take all the 6's out of set A, it doesn't change it since there was no 6 to begin with.

43
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:32,496
I can take all the zebras out of set A - it will not change it.

44
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:38,035
Another way to denote the relative complement of set B in A

45
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,164
or B subtracted from A

46
00:03:40,164 --> 00:03:43,096
is the notation I'm about to write.

47
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:43,969
We could have written it this way:

48
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:52,305
A, and this little figure right here that 
looks eerily like a division sign

49
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:57,170
but this also means "the difference between set A and B".

50
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:03,237
When we write it this way, we're talking about all of the things in set A that are not in set B

51
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:06,473
or the things in set B taken out of set A

52
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,837
or the relative complement of B in A.

53
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:13,056
Let's think about things the other way around.

54
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:27,708
What would B slash A, or B minus A be?

55
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:37,882
We could also write it as B - A.

56
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:41,785
What would this be equal to?

57
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:48,451
We could view this as all of the things in B with 
all of the things in A taken out of it

58
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:54,681
or the complement of A that happens to be in B.

59
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:58,369
Let's think of it as the set B with all 
the things in A taken out of it.

60
00:04:58,369 --> 00:05:01,949
If we start with set B, we have a 17.

61
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,282
But a 17 is in set A, so we have to take the 17 out.

62
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:09,034
Then we have a 19, but there's a 19 in set A 
so we have to take the 19 out.

63
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:14,831
Then we have a 6 but we don't have to take 
a 6 out of B because a 6 is not in set A

64
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,696
so we're left with just the 6.

65
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:23,232
So this would the set with the single element in it, set 6.

66
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,464
Let me ask another question.

67
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:34,009
What would the relative complement of A in A be?

68
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:39,114
This is the same thing as A minus A 
and this is literally saying

69
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:44,280
let's take set A and take all of the things in set A out of it.

70
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,969
I start with a 5 but there's a 5 in set A so I take the 5 out.

71
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,636
There's a 3 but there's a 3 in set A 
so I have to take the 3 out.

72
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:58,302
I'm going to take all of these things out, so I'm 
just going to be left with the empty set.

73
00:05:58,302 --> 00:06:02,099
The empty set, often called the null set.

74
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,335
Sometimes the notation for that will look like this.

75
00:06:05,335 --> 00:06:08,585
The null set, the empty set.

76
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:12,585
There's a set that has absolutely no objects in it.
