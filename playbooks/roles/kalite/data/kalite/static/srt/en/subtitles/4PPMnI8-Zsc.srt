1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,310
All right, we're on problem
number seven.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,635
And when I copied and
pasted it I made it

4
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:05,310
a little bit smaller.

5
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,030
So I'm going to read it for you
just in case this is too

6
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,330
small for you to read.

7
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,980
It says, use the proof to answer
the question below.

8
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,560
So they gave us that angle 2
is congruent to angle 3.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,070
So the measure of angle
2 is equal to the

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,190
measure of angle 3.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,510
I'm trying to get the knack of
the language that they use in

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,520
geometry class.

13
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,590
Which, I will admit, that
language kind of tends to

14
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,810
disappear as you leave
your geometry class.

15
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,330
But since we're in
geometry class,

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,800
we'll use that language.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,950
So angle 2 is congruent
to angle 3.

18
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,690
Which means that their
measure is the same.

19
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,510
Or that they kind of did the
same angle, essentially.

20
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,910
Fair enough.

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,890
So let's see.

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,870
Statement one, angle 2 is
congruent to angle 3.

23
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,120
That's given, I drew that
already up here.

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,850
Statement two, angle 1 is
congruent to angle 2, angle 3

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,430
is congruent to angle 4.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,270
So they're saying that angle
2 is congruent to angle 1.

27
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,830
Or angle 1 is congruent
to angle 2.

28
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,129
That's right there.

29
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,850
And that angle 4 is congruent
to angle 3.

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,720
Fair enough.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,910
And they say, what's the reason
that you could give.

32
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,130
And I forgot the actual
terminology.

33
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,590
But in my head, I was thinking
opposite angles are equal or

34
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,490
the measures are equal,
or they are congruent.

35
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,250
And you could just imagine two
sticks and changing the angles

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,800
of the intersection.

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,140
You'll see that opposite
angles are

38
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,830
always going to be congruent.

39
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,680
Let's see, that is the
reason I would give.

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
Opposite angles are congruent.

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,100
Let's see which statement of the
choices is most like what

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,020
I just said.

43
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,910
Complements of congruent
angles are congruent.

44
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,450
Complements.

45
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,610
Vertical angles are congruent.

46
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,030
I think that's what they
call opposite angles.

47
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,360
Vertical angles.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,740
I think that's what they mean
by opposite angles.

49
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,890
Supplements of congruent
angles are congruent.

50
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,490
That's not true.

51
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,350
Corresponding angles
are congruent.

52
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,530
These aren't corresponding.

53
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,600
I think this is what they
mean by vertical angles.

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,450
Complements of congruent
angles are congruent.

55
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,370
You know what, I'm going
to look this

56
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,810
up with you on Wikipedia.

57
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,900
Let me see.

58
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,930
Vertical angles.

59
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,840
As you can see, at the age of
32 some of the terminology

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,640
starts to escape you.

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,580
What matters is that you
understand the intuition and

62
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,710
then you can do these Wikipedia
searches to just

63
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,070
make sure that you remember
the right terminology.

64
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,170
Let's see what Wikipedia
has to say about it.

65
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,910
Vertical angles.

66
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,710
A pair of angles is said to be
vertical or opposite, I guess

67
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,110
I used the British English,
opposite angles if the angles

68
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,700
share the same vertex and are
bounded by the same pair of

69
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,320
lines but are opposite
to each other.

70
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,700
Right.

71
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,350
So somehow, growing up in
Louisiana, I somehow picked up

72
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,470
the British English
version of it.

73
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,210
Maybe because the word opposite
made a lot more sense

74
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,840
to me than the word vertical.

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,650
With that said, they're
the same thing.

76
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,940
Wikipedia has shown
us the light.

77
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,420
And so my logic of opposite
angles is the same as their

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,280
logic of vertical angles
are congruent.

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,530
Next problem.

80
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,080
   

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,620
I'll start using the
U.S. terminology.

82
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,780
Although I think there are a
good number of people outside

83
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,760
of the U.S. who watch these.

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,650
So maybe it's good that I
somehow picked up the British

85
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,040
English version of it.

86
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,720
   

87
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,290
Once again, it might be
hard for you to read.

88
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,410
I'll read it out for you.

89
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,700
Two lines in a plane
always intersect

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,910
in exactly one point.

91
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,200
Fair enough.

92
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,230
Which of the following best
describes a counter example to

93
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:39,960
the assertion above.

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,150
I like to think of
the answer even

95
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,980
before seeing the choices.

96
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,940
So can I think of two lines in
a plane that always intersect

97
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,280
at exactly one point.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,830
Well, what if they
are parallel?

99
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,420
What if I have that line
and that line.

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,960
They're never going to intersect
with each other.

101
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,600
They're parallel.

102
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,490
That's the definition
of parallel lines.

103
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:04,150
The other example I
can think of is if

104
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,410
they're the same line.

105
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,430
I guess you might not want to
call them two the lines then.

106
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,880
But I would.

107
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,400
This line and then
I had this line.

108
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,640
Well that's parallel, but
imagine they were right on top

109
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
of each other, they would
intersect everywhere.

110
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,260
So either of those would be
counter examples to the idea

111
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,450
that two lines in a plane
always intersect

112
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,260
at exactly one point.

113
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,310
And if we look at their choices,
well OK, they have

114
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,340
the first thing I just
wrote there.

115
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,770
Parallel lines, obviously they
are two lines in a plane.

116
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,400
But they don't intersect
in one point.

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,090
Problem eight.

118
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,820
I'm going to make it a little
bigger from now on so

119
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,240
you can read it.

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,055
OK, this is problem nine.

121
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:46,920
   

122
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,120
Which figure can serve as the
counter example to the

123
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,450
conjecture below?

124
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,050
If one pair of opposite sides
of a quadrilateral is

125
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,790
parallel, then the quadrilateral
is a

126
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,380
parallelogram.

127
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,880
So once again, a lot
of terminology.

128
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,440
And I do remember these
from my geometry days.

129
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,620
Quadrilateral means
four sides.

130
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,230
A four sided figure.

131
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,640
And a parallelogram
means that all the

132
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
opposite sides are parallel.

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
For example, this is
a parallelogram.

134
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,750
   

135
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me see how well
I can do this.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,220
   

137
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,250
If you ignore this little part
is hanging off there, that's a

138
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,200
parallelogram.

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
And if all the sides were
the same, it's a

140
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,190
rhombus and all of that.

141
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,160
But that's a parallelogram.

142
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,550
And that's a parallelogram
because this side is parallel

143
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,910
to that side.

144
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,350
And this side is parallel
to that side.

145
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,920
All the sides are parallel.

146
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,190
Now they say, if one pair
of opposite sides of a

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,640
quadrilateral is parallel, then
the quadrilateral is a

148
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,070
parallelogram.

149
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,470
So I want to give a
counter example.

150
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,980
Let me draw a figure that has
two sides that are parallel.

151
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,050
Let's say that side and that
side are parallel.

152
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,700
And I don't want the other
two to be parallel.

153
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,620
Then it wouldn't be
a parallelogram.

154
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,200
Let's say the other sides
are not parallel.

155
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,170
Let's say they look like that.

156
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,250
And like that.

157
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,330
And once again, just digging in
my head of definitions of

158
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,380
shapes, that looks like
a trapezoid to me.

159
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,660
So let's see.

160
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,550
Yeah, good, you have a trapezoid
as a choice.

161
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,910
Trapezoid.

162
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,240
All the rest are parallelograms.
A rectangle,

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,470
all the sides are parellel.

164
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,130
And we have all 90
degree angles.

165
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,150
Rectangles are actually a subset
of parallelograms.

166
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,980
Rhombus, we have a parallelogram
where all of the

167
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,610
sides are the same length.

168
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,570
All the angles aren't
necessarily equal.

169
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,930
Square is all the sides are
parallel, equal, and all the

170
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,980
angles are 90 degrees.

171
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,940
So all of these are subsets
of parallelograms.

172
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,260
This is not a parallelogram.

173
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,500
Although it does have two
sides that are parallel.

174
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,220
So this is the counter example
to the conjecture.

175
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,450
I think you're already
seeing a pattern.

176
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,210
In a lot of geometry,
the terminology is

177
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,461
often the hard part.

178
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:09,900
The ideas aren't as deep as the
terminology might suggest.

179
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,840
Given, TRAP, that already
makes me worried.

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,460
Given TRAP is an isosceles
trapezoid with diagonals RP

181
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,410
and TA, which of the following
must be true?

182
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,970
OK, let's see what
we can do here.

183
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,210
So an isosceles trapezoid means
that the two sides that

184
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,910
lead up from the base to
the top side are equal.

185
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,640
Kind of like an isosceles
triangle.

186
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,140
So let me draw that.

187
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,300
Actually, I'm kind
of guessing that.

188
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
I haven't seen the definition
of an isosceles triangle

189
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,590
anytime in the recent past.
An isosceles trapezoid.

190
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,030
But it sounds right.

191
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,616
So I'll go with it.

192
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,295
And that's a good
skill in life.

193
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,930
   

194
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,570
So I think what they say when
they say an isosceles

195
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,900
trapezoid, they are essentially
saying that this

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,650
side, it's a trapezoid,
so that's going

197
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,180
to be equal to that.

198
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,510
They're saying that this side
is equal to that side.

199
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,760
An isosceles trapezoid.

200
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,910
   

201
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,280
And they say RP and TA
are diagonals of it.

202
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Let me draw that.

203
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,720
So let me actually write
the whole TRAP.

204
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:29,920
So this is T R A P
is a trapezoid.

205
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,470
Let me draw the diagonals.

206
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:38,169
RP is that diagonal.

207
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,750
And TA is this diagonal
right here.

208
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,600
   

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,390
OK.

210
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,020
All right, let's see
what we can do.

211
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,330
Which of the following
must be true?

212
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,700
RP is perpendicular to TA.

213
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,840
Well, I can already tell
you that that's

214
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,530
not going to be true.

215
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,560
And you don't even
have to prove it.

216
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,360
Because you can even
visualize it.

217
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,310
If you squeezed the
top part down.

218
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,730
Imagine some device where this
is kind of a cross-section.

219
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,800
If you were to squeeze the top
down, they didn't tell us how

220
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,480
high it is.

221
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,540
Then these angles, let me
see if I can draw it.

222
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,150
That angle and that angle, which
are opposite or vertical

223
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,550
angles, which we know is
the U.S. word for it.

224
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,135
Those are going to get smaller
and smaller if

225
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,560
we squeeze it down.

226
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,710
And in order for both of these
to be perpendicular those

227
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,940
would have to be 90
degree angles.

228
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
And we already can
see that that's

229
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,750
definitely not the case.

230
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,060
All right.

231
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,660
RP is parallel to TA.

232
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,700
Well that's clearly not the
case, they intersect.

233
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,190
All right, they're
the diagonals.

234
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,840
RP is congruent to TA.

235
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,980
Well, that looks pretty
good to me.

236
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,340
Because it's an isosceles
trapezoid.

237
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:59,005
If we drew a line of symmetry
here, everything you see on

238
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,060
this side is going to be kind
of congruent to its mirror

239
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,280
image on that side.

240
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,430
So both of these lines, this is
going to be equal to this.

241
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,470
And I can make the argument, but
basically we know that RP,

242
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,620
since this is an isosceles
trapezoid, you could imagine

243
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,680
kind of continuing a triangle
and making an isosceles

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,240
triangle here.

245
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,390
Then we would know that that
angle is equal to that angle.

246
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,670
   

247
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, actually I'm not going
to go down that path.

248
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,100
But you can almost look
at it from inspection.

249
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,340
Although, maybe I should do
a little more rigorous

250
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,550
definition of it.

251
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:39,040
But RP is definitely going
to be congruent to TA.

252
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,200
Because both sides of
these trapezoids

253
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,480
are going to be symmetric.

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,730
And so there's no way you
could have RP being a

255
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,160
different length than TA.

256
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,340
Since this trapezoid is
perfectly symmetric, since

257
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,800
it's isoceles.

258
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,610
And then D, RP bisects TA.

259
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,610
   

260
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,710
Let's say if I were to draw
this trapezoid slightly

261
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,870
differently.

262
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,170
If it looks something
like this.

263
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:10,130
   

264
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,380
If this was the trapezoid.

265
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,010
   

266
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,640
This is also an isosceles
trapezoid.

267
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,690
   

268
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,830
And then the diagonals
would look like this.

269
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:29,730
   

270
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,050
So here, it's pretty clear that
they're not bisecting

271
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,440
each other.

272
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,600
In order for them to bisect each
other, this length would

273
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,760
have to be equal
to that length.

274
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,370
And that's clear just by
looking at it that

275
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,890
that's not the case.

276
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,280
That is not equal to that.

277
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,990
So they're definitely not
bisecting each other.

278
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,860
So you can really, in this
problem, knock out

279
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,240
choices A, B and D.

280
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,510
And say oh well choice
C looks pretty good.

281
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,760
But you can actually deduce that
by using an argument of

282
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,010
all of the angles.

283
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,670
   

284
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,820
Anyway, that's going
to waste your time.

285
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,180
But that's a good exercise
for you.

286
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,120
Is to make the formal proof
argument of why this is true.

287
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,210
Although, you can make a pretty
good intuitive argument

288
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,210
just based on the symmetry
of the triangle itself.

289
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,750
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

290
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,900
