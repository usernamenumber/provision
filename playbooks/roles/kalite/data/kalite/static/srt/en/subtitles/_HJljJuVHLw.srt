1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,260
We're on problem 46.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:10,960
In the figure below, line
segment AB is parallel to C.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,010
I think there's a typo here.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,130
I've got to believe this
has got to be CD.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,850
That's got to be a typo.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,690
All right, so AB, I'm assuming,
is parallel to CD.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,580
That's probably what they wanted
to have, because you

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,580
can't be parallel to a vertex.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,860
And they say, what is
the value of x?

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,620
So the way to think about it is,
if these two are parallel

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,080
lines, then this segment up
here is a transversal.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,500
If we just extend the two lines
like this, let me see if

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,890
I can do it well.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,510
So if I extended that line like
that, and if I extended

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,690
this line like that, then
segment AD is just a

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,230
transversal.

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,890
Let me see if I can
do that one right.

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,610
So if I just extended it like
that, you see it's a

20
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,110
transversal, and I could go the
other direction as well.

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,860
I think you get the idea.

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,810
So if that is a transversal,
what do you know about

23
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,260
transversals?

24
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:06,900
We know that this angle right
here, I'll draw it small, is

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,920
congruent to this
angle over here.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,790
So the measure of this angle
is also x plus 40.

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,650
Because they're corresponding
angles, and you could see that

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,460
by inspection, and if you moved
around the transversal,

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,400
it would make sense that
that's the case.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
So this is x plus 40 and this
is minus 40, and they're

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,570
clearly supplements
of each other.

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,940
They're supplementary angles.

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,510
Then the sum of these
two angles have

34
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,450
to be equal to 180.

35
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,350
So let's figure it out.

36
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:37,500
So x minus 40 plus x plus 40
is equal to 180, because

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,420
they're supplementary.

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,960
The 40's cancel out.

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,840
So you just minus 40, plus
40 adds up to zero.

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,420
So you're left with 2x
is equal to 180.

41
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,920
x is equal to 90.

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,170
So it's D.

43
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,650
   

44
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,410
47: The measures of the interior
angles of a pentagon

45
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:05,110
are 2x, 6x, 4x minus 6, 2x
minus 16, and 6x plus 2.

46
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,990
What is the measure in degrees
of the largest angle?

47
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,590
OK, so first of all, we have to
remember what is the sum of

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,470
the interior angles
of a pentagon?

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,160
And that's where I always draw
an arbitrary pentagon.

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,260
Let me see if I can do that.

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,760
Actually, there's a
polygon tool here.

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,010
How does it work?

53
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,590
   

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm just trying to
draw a pentagon.

55
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,070
   

56
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,130
I don't know if that's any
different than the line tool,

57
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,750
but regardless.

58
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,560
So how many triangles can
I draw in a pentagon?

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,270
And that tells me what my total
interior angles are.

60
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,970
And there is a formula for that,
but I like relying on

61
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,300
your reasoning more than the
formula, because you might

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,170
forget the formula, or even
worse, you might remember it,

63
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,190
but not have the confidence to
use it, or you might remember

64
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,930
it wrong ten years
in the future.

65
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,540
So the best thing to do, if
you have a polygon, is to

66
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,180
count the triangles in it.

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,330
Straightforward enough.

68
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,060
It's almost easier than
using the formula.

69
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,810
So a pentagon has three
triangles in it.

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,580
So the sum of its interior
angles are going to be 3 times

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,170
180, because it has
3 triangles in it.

72
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,070
Each triangle has 180 degrees.

73
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,450
And I know you can't see
what I just wrote.

74
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,710
So the sum of all of these
angles are going to be the sum

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,620
of all of the angles in
all three triangles.

76
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,260
So it's 3 times 180 is
equal to 540 degrees.

77
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,340
So that's the sum of all of
these interior angles.

78
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,400
Now, they say that each of them
are 2x, 6x, et cetera.

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,570
So the sum of all of these terms
have to be equal 540.

80
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,365
I'm going to write
them vertically.

81
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,660
It makes them easier to add.

82
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:53,810
So if we write there 2x, 6x,
4x minus 6, 2x minus

83
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,320
16, and 6x plus 2.

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,100
This is going to be the
largest, right?

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,610
That sum is going
to equal 540.

86
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,660
So let's add this up.

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,050
Minus 6, minus 16,
that's minus 22.

88
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,970
Plus 2 is minus 20.

89
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,220
That's right.

90
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,240
   

91
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:27,820
And 2x plus 6x that is 8x plus
4 is 12, 12 plus 2 is 14, 14

92
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,280
plus 6 is 20.

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,220
So we have 20x minus 20 is
equal to 540 degrees.

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:38,990
Let me write it again.

95
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,890
20x minus 20 is equal to 540.

96
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,740
Let's divide both sides of
this equation by 20.

97
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:56,800
So you get x 1 minus 1 is equal
to-- it would be 54

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,610
divided by 2, which
is equal to 27.

99
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,790
Add 1 to both sides,
x is equal to 28.

100
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,040
And they want to know, what is
a measure in degrees of the

101
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,620
largest angle?

102
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,890
That's going to be this one.

103
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,810
That's the largest one.

104
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,900
It's 6 times x plus 2.

105
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:21,320
So 6 times 28, that's 48.

106
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,470
2 times 6 is 12 plus 4 is 168.

107
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,510
So it's 168 plus 2.

108
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,960
It's 170 degrees.

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,610
Choice C.

110
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,290
Problem 48: What is the
measure of angle 1?

111
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,770
So this we're going into
the angle game.

112
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,530
And these are fun, because
they are kind of these

113
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,840
deductive reasoning problems
where you just use a couple of

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,220
simple rules and just fill
in the whole thing.

115
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,590
So let's think about it.

116
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,680
This is 36 degrees.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,720
They tell us that this
whole angle right

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,430
here is a right angle.

119
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,560
So this angle right here is
going to be the complement to

120
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,100
36 degrees.

121
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,790
36 plus this angle have
to be equal to 90.

122
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,270
So what's this one?

123
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,860
This one is 90 minus
36, which is 54.

124
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,980
That's going to be 54 degrees.

125
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,560
90 minus 30 is 60.

126
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,090
Right, that's 54.

127
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,060
And this angle right here,
that's going to be the

128
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,810
supplement of 88.

129
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,130
So this is going to be-- I'll
do it in a different color--

130
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,940
180 minus 88.

131
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,260
That is equal to 92 degrees.

132
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,290
Now this angle 1 plus the 54
plus the 92 is equal to 180.

133
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:44,290
So we know that-- let's say
angle one plus 54 plus 92 is

134
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:51,920
equal to 180.

135
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,860
This is 146 is equal to 180.

136
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,790
Subtract 146 from both sides.

137
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:06,430
The measure of angle one is
equal to 80 minus 40 is 40, so

138
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,820
80 minus 46 is equal
to 34 degrees.

139
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,930
So the answer is A.

140
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:20,460
Problem 49: What is the
measure of angle WZX?

141
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,820
So they want to know what this
angle right here is.

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,110
Let's do the angle
game some more.

143
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,950
Let's see, we can immediately
figure out what this angle is,

144
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,350
because it is the supplement
of 132 degrees, so this is

145
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:40,460
going to be 180 minus 132.

146
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,950
So this is 48 degrees.

147
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,580
This angle plus this angle
is going to be

148
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,820
equal to this angle.

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,630
Or this angle plus this
angle plus this

150
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,560
angle is equal to 180.

151
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,510
I don't know what I just
said, I think I

152
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,450
said something wrong.

153
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,230
Write that down.

154
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,220
So this angle is going
to be equal to 180

155
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,780
minus 52 minus 48.

156
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,460
Because the sum of the angles
add up to 180, and so that is

157
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:16,870
equal to 180 minus 100 which
equals 80 degrees.

158
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,530
So this angle right here
is equal to 80 degrees.

159
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,830
And the angle they want us to
figure out is the opposite of

160
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,200
this angle, or in the
U.S., I guess, they

161
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,630
say vertical angles.

162
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,770
And so opposite or vertical
angles are equal or they're

163
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,080
congruent, so this is going
to be 80 degrees as well.

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,750
And that is choice A.

165
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,309
   

166
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,390
Problem 50: What is the measure
of an exterior angle

167
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,000
of a regular hexagon?

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,560
A regular hexagon tells us that
all of the sides are the

169
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,750
same, it's equilateral, and
all of the angles are the

170
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,870
same, equiangular.

171
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,350
So if we just knew what's the
total degree measure of the

172
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,630
interior angles, we could just
divide that by 6, and then

173
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,710
that would give us what each
of the interior angles are,

174
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,210
and then we could use that
information to figure out the

175
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:06,890
exterior angles.

176
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,500
Let's just do it.

177
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,180
So once again, I like to
just draw a hexagon.

178
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,480
Let's just draw a hexagon and
count the triangles in it.

179
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,440
Two sides, three sides,
four sides, five

180
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,070
sides and six sides.

181
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,300
And how many triangles
do I have here?

182
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,650
One, two, three.

183
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,710
So I have one, two, three,
four triangles.

184
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,400
The sum of the interior angles
of this hexagon, of any

185
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,150
hexagon, whether it's regular
or not, are going to be 4

186
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:51,810
times 180 and that's
720 degrees.

187
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,640
And it's a regular hexagon, so
all the interior angles are

188
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,390
going to be the same.

189
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,600
And there's six of them.

190
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,690
So each of them are going
to be 720 divided by 6.

191
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,030
Well, 6 goes into
72 twelve times.

192
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:15,250
So each of the interior angles
are going to be 120 degrees.

193
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,160
And I didn't draw it that
regular, but we can assume

194
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,640
that all of these are
each 120 degrees.

195
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,790
Fair enough.

196
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,220
Now, if all of those are each
120 degrees, what is the

197
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,790
measure of an exterior angle?

198
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,150
Well, we could just extend
one of these sides

199
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,440
out a little bit.

200
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,260
We could say, OK, if this is
120 degrees, what is its

201
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,670
supplement?

202
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,760
Well, these have to add
up to 180, so 180

203
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,560
minus 120 is 60 degrees.

204
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,410
I could do it on any side.

205
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,390
I could extend that line out
there, and I'd say, oh, that's

206
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,300
60 degrees.

207
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,680
So any of the exterior angles
are 60 degrees.

208
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,030
B.

209
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,180
All right, do I have
time for one more?

210
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,665
I'll wait for the next one
in the next video.

211
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,190
See you soon.

212
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,900
