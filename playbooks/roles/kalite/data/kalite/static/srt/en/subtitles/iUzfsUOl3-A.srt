1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,420
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,610
On the last video we came to
the conclusion that we could

4
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,020
figure out the volume when we
rotate a function about the

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,400
x-axis, so let's apply that
to an actual exercise.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm going to erase everything
because I don't want you to

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,660
memorize this, because frankly
I haven't memorized this.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,170
And if you do, you'll forget
it one day and then you

9
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:21,990
won't know how to do it.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,990
But if you understand why it
works then you'll never forget.

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,550
As long as you remember
basic integration.

12
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,610
   

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,490
Maybe you want to memorize it
if your teacher tends to give

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,830
you a test that don't have
much extra time in them, just

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,900
to speed up the process.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,720
But you should know
what's going on.

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,090
So let me draw the axes again.

18
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,340
That's my y-axis.

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,420
That's my x-axis.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,708
And so since our first example
was y equals square root of

21
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,235
x, let's stick with that.

22
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:54,970
And for reasons that might
become apparent that tends to

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,230
be one of the more typical
examples when you rotate

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,980
things around axes.

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,040
So let me see if I can draw it
as well as I drew it last time.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,230
Almost.

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,920
OK, so that's y equals square
root of x, it's just f of x

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,500
this time, I've defined it.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,110
This is the x-axis.

30
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,980
That's the y-axis.

31
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,000
And I'm going to rotate this
around the x-axis again.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
So I'm going to get a
sideways looking cup thing.

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,780
And let's say I want to figure
out the volume of that cup

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,680
between the points 0-- and to
make it simple, let's just

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,370
say the points 0 and 1.

36
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,670
So essentially we're just going
to get a cup, a sideways

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,375
cup, it's going to look
something like this.

38
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,900
   

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,280
It's going to look
something like this.

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,590
That's going to be the--
that's a horrible-- the

41
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,950
opening of the cup.

42
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,490
Actually why don't I
use the circle tool.

43
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,650
It just dawned on me that
I had a circle tool.

44
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,255
So the opening of the cup
will look like that.

45
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,975
   

46
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,210
Actually I could
draw it right here.

47
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,020
This would be the
opening of the cup.

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,820
Well-- you can see sometimes
that my videos are

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,980
a little unplanned.

50
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,650
There you go.

51
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,230
So that would be the
opening of the cup.

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,320
This is excellent.

53
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,550
This tool is very well suited
for what I'm doing here.

54
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,390
We're rotating around that way.

55
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,280
We're turning that function.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,980
So the cup's going to look like
that, so the bottom part of the

57
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,390
cup's going to look like this.

58
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,310
And it's solid, so we want the
volume of the whole thing.

59
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,310
In future videos I'm going to
show you actually how to figure

60
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,770
out the surface area of the
cup, which I find in some

61
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,950
ways more interesting.

62
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,250
So how do we think
about that again?

63
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,220
Let's just rederive it,
but this time we'll use

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,610
a specific equation.

65
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,710
So we just have to figure out
what is the volume of one disk

66
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,420
and then sum up all the disks.

67
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,970
So let's say this disk right
here-- actually let's just take

68
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,090
this disk at the end point
right here that I've already

69
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,850
drawn something for.

70
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,500
So what's the radius
of this disk?

71
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,330
The radius of that disk
is f of x at that point.

72
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,830
Well f of x at that point
is just square root of x.

73
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,740
Radius is equal to
square root of x.

74
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:17,870
And so the area of that disk is
going to equal pi r squared.

75
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,830
Well the radius is square root
of x, so it equals pi times

76
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,540
square root of x squared.

77
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,440
So it equals pi times x.

78
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,830
That's the area of each disk.

79
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,860
And then if we want the volume,
you just have to multiply the

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,550
area of that surface times
the depth of the disk.

81
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,870
I'm just trying to show.

82
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,530
You can imagine that this is
kind of like a quarter and this

83
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,600
is the side of the quarter.

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,590
   

85
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,730
We saw in the last video that
depth, that's just a very

86
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,710
small change in x, because
we want each disk to be

87
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,540
infinitesimally thin.

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,720
So the width is just
dx at any point.

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,550
So the volume of each disk is
equal to the area, which we

90
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:10,305
just figured out was pi x
times the depth, times dx.

91
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,190
That's the volume of each disk.

92
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,620
So the total volume is
going to be equal to the

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,840
sum of all of these.

94
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,470
That was one disk I drew, then
you're going to have another

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,980
one here, you're going to have
another one here,

96
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,610
another one here.

97
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,100
You're going to have infinitely
many, and you want them to be

98
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,250
super, super, super thin so
that you get an accurate

99
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,120
measure of the exact
volume of this curve.

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,890
Otherwise it would just be an
approximation, and that's

101
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,330
where we use the integral.

102
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,900
So it will be the
integral from.

103
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,170
And my original
boundaries were 0 to 1.

104
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,600
The disk we used as an example,
this is probably you know the

105
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,290
last disk, so this one will
actually have a radius of the

106
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,250
square root of 1, which is 1.

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,840
Not that you have to know that,
I'm just trying to keep

108
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,730
emphasizing the visualization.

109
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,240
So what will be the integral?

110
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,500
Well we're going to go from 0
to 1, and we're going to sum up

111
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,820
a bunch of these disks, which
we've already defined,

112
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,530
so it's pi x dx.

113
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,010
This is looking to be a fairly
straightforward integral.

114
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,300
So what's the integral of that?

115
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,400
   

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,670
Pi is just a constant and the
antiderivative of x is x to

117
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,525
the 1/2 over-- I'm sorry.

118
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:30,150
   

119
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,795
It's x squared over 2.

120
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,980
   

121
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,840
I've been a little rusty
since I last did some

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,410
antiderivatives.

123
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,330
So we get x squared, we get
pi times x squared over 2.

124
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,420
   

125
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,460
That's the
antiderivative of that.

126
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,536
And then we have to evaluate
it at 1 and then subtract

127
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:56,010
it and evaluate it at 0.

128
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,860
And so what do we have.

129
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:07,960
We get 1/2 pi, so we get pi
over 2 minus 0 pi, minus 0.

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,950
So it equals pi over 2.

131
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,510
There we go.

132
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,610
We just figured out the volume
of this cup from 0 to 1.

133
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,730
Reasonably interesting.

134
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,210
Let's see if we can do that
again to figure out the-- just

135
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,880
to give you another example,
just hit the point home-- to

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,460
see if we can figure out the
volume of a sphere,

137
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,340
the equation for the
volume of a sphere.

138
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,480
So what's the equation
for a circle?

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,770
It's x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

140
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,540
And let's write that in terms
of y is a function of x, just

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,530
so we have something that
we can work with the

142
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,260
way we learned it.

143
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:59,300
So we get y squared is equal to
r squared minus x squared, and

144
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:09,600
then we get y is equal to the
square root of r squared

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,380
minus x squared.

146
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,920
Actually now that I realize it,
I'm going to not do this,

147
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,910
because I think I'm going into
too complicated a problem.

148
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,910
I did that on a fly.

149
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,040
But in the next video I will
do slightly more complicated

150
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,640
without going to this one,
because I probably don't have

151
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,100
time for it I just realized.

152
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,350
Anyway I'll see you
in the next video.

153
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,650
