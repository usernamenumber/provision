1
00:00:01,096 --> 00:00:04,407
For acute angle E, so that's this angle

2
00:00:04,407 --> 00:00:05,143
right over here,

3
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:06,352
it tells that sin of E is 5 over

4
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:09,601
the square root of 41, and cotangent of E is

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,853
equal to 8/10. Find the values of the

6
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:15,137
other four trigonometric ratios. So for

7
00:00:15,137 --> 00:00:17,272
the trig ratios, I like to use SOH-CAH-TOA

8
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:20,263
to remember what the definitions of the trig ratios were

9
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,100
So let me write this down,

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,845
SOH, CAH

11
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,069
I'll write CAH in a different color,

12
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,537
SOH, CAH

13
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:29,606
that's not a different color

14
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:30,515
I'm trying-

15
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:32,604
I'm having trouble changing colors!

16
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,355
SOH, CAH, TOA.

17
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:36,845
SOH, CAH, TOA.

18
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:40,404
So, SOH tells us that sine of an angle

19
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:41,604
in this case we care about angle E,

20
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:44,933
is equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse.

21
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,076
If we look at angle E, what is the opposite?

22
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:48,804
Well, we go across the triangle

23
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,681
the opposite is right over there.

24
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:53,515
That is the opposite so it would be equal to

25
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:55,800
5 over the hypotenuse.

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,801
Well, the hypotenuse is opposite the right-angle,

27
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,867
and it's the longest side of the triangle, it's side DE

28
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,269
and has length of square-root of 41.

29
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,853
Square-root of 41.

30
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,770
So that's consistently the information they gave us

31
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,869
so this was kind of redundant information,

32
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:11,267
we could have figured that out just from

33
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,432
the diagram.

34
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:15,136
But at least we got that out of the way.

35
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,773
Now let's think about,

36
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:20,145
now let's think about the reciprocal of the sine of E,

37
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:23,679
which is the co-secant of E.

38
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,536
Co-secant of E

39
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,354
which is the reciprocal sine which is

40
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,351
hypotenuse over the opposite.

41
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,271
and we could-

42
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,535
we don't even have to look at the triangle

43
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:33,767
we could just say the reciprocal

44
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:35,605
which would be the square-root of 41 over 5.

45
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:39,470
Or you could look back at this and try to figure that out.

46
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,934
Now let's think about the cosine.

47
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,203
What is the cosine?

48
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:48,770
What is the cosine of E going to be equal to?

49
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,736
Well, first think of what the definition is.

50
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,203
Cosine of E is going to be what?

51
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:54,773
Well, CAH tells us that this is going to be

52
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:58,688
equal to the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

53
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:02,098
Well, if we look over here, we know what the hypotenuse is.

54
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,268
The hypotenuse the same.

55
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:09,349
The hypotenuse is the square-root of 41.

56
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,801
What is the adjacent side?

57
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,210
What length does the adjacent side have?

58
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,018
Well, for angle E, the adjacent side is side FE

59
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,203
and we don't know what that is right over here.

60
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:20,203
So that is the adjacent side and

61
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:21,354
we don't know what that is

62
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:22,770
So I'll just write 'a'.

63
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,355
'a' for how they marked it on this,

64
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,683
or you could also do this 'a' for 'adjacent.

65
00:02:26,683 --> 00:02:27,737
So right now we're just gonna

66
00:02:27,737 --> 00:02:30,069
leave it with the variable 'a' over the square-root of 41

67
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:32,199
maybe we can get a little bit more information

68
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,603
that helps us to figure out what 'a' is

69
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:37,535
over the course of this problem.

70
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,891
If you wanna figure out what the secant of E is,

71
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,809
well, that's just the inverse of the cosine

72
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:44,137
it's hypotenuse over adjacent,

73
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:47,473
so it's going to be the square-root of 41 over 'a'.

74
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:51,139
Whatever 'a' is. Hopefully we can figure that out.

75
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:52,473
Now let's use TOA.

76
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:57,936
That tells us that the tangent of E is equal to the opposite over the adjacent.

77
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,388
Well, what's the opposite side to angle E?

78
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:05,224
Well, it's side- it has length 5, it's side DF

79
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:06,675
The opposite is 5.

80
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:08,670
And we still don't know the length of the adjacent side.

81
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,804
That's this side of length 'a'.

82
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,674
So I'll just write 'a', right over there.

83
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:15,535
Now what about cotangent?

84
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:18,209
Well, cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent.

85
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,401
So it's adjacent over opposite or in this case,

86
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,616
'a' over 5.

87
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,109
Adjacent over opposite; 'a' over 5.

88
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:29,358
Well, what do they already tell us?

89
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:34,032
And using that, can you figure out what 'a' is?

90
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:37,286
Well, they already told us that cotangent of E

91
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:40,203
is equal to 8/10.

92
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,604
There's a little clue here that this is not

93
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,074
reduced fully; 8/10.

94
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:44,473
8 and 10 share common factors.

95
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:47,269
So they already tell us that cotangent of E is 8/10.

96
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,605
So if we use the definition of cotangent of E we get 'a' over 5,

97
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:56,014
and they tell us that that is going to be equal to 8/10.

98
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:59,939
So we can write, we have an equation now to solve for 'a'.

99
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,003
And if we solve for 'a' now we can figure out all of the other,

100
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,088
all of the other ratios.

101
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:06,469
So let's do that.

102
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:09,843
So we have 'a' over 5 is equal to,

103
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,268
-we'll simplify this in a little bit-

104
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,437
what is 8/10 if you simplify it?

105
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:16,354
Well, we have 8 by- we have a common factor of 2-

106
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:19,140
if you divide 8 by 2 you get 4,

107
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,933
we divide 10 by two, we get 5.

108
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,468
So we get 'a' over 5 is equal to 4/5.

109
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,935
And so this is actually- we could cross-multiply or

110
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:29,077
multiply both sides by 5 and you would get

111
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:30,203
-either way-

112
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,204
you would get that 'a' is equal to 4.

113
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,771
Let's do that, just to show you you can do it systematically.

114
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,203
And you're left with 'a' is equal to 4 which is great

115
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:42,803
because we can now say that the cotangent of E,

116
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:46,101
yes it's 8/10 which is the same thing as 4/5.

117
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,472
We could say that the tangent of E

118
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:48,768
-instead of saying it's 5 over 'a'-

119
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,936
we can now say that it's 5 over 4.

120
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:54,670
And now what would the cosine of E be?

121
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,536
Well, it was 'a' over (square-root of) 41,

122
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:58,938
now it is -let me do that in a different color-

123
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:01,329
now it is 4 over the square-root of 41.

124
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:05,431
And what is the secant of E now?

125
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,184
Well, it was square-root of 41 over 'a',

126
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:12,871
now it's square-root of 41 over 4.

127
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:15,437
Because now we know the value of 'a'.

128
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:18,373
And we can verify that 'a' is equal to 4

129
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,019
by using the Pythagorean theorem.

130
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,436
In fact, we could've solved it that way.

131
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:24,095
But the whole point, I'm suspecting, of this problem,

132
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,266
is to actually establish this (a = 4)

133
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,767
using this (cotangent of E= 8/10) information

134
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,813
even although we could have done it using the Pythagorean theorem.

135
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:33,068
But let's just verify that this 'a=4' satisfies

136
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,936
the Pythagorean theorem.

137
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,999
So if we take this side right over here,

138
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,603
we got 4 squared plus 5 squared

139
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:44,471
should be equal to the square-root of 41 squared.

140
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,880
Should be equal to the hypotenuse squared.

141
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,964
Square-root of 41 squared.

142
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:50,804
So 4 squared is 16,

143
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:52,736
5 squared is 25,

144
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,135
so does this actually meet-

145
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,939
does this actually satisfy the Pythagorean theorem?

146
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,402
So 16 plus 25,

147
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,805
square-root of 41 squared is 41,

148
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:06,623
16 plus 25 is indeed 41.

149
00:06:06,623 --> 00:06:09,538
So at least it's consistent with the Pythagorean theorem,

150
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:12,000
and we are done!
