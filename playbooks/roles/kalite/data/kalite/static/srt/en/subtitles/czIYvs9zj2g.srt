1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,830
Let's say I've got an
m-by-n matrix A.

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,500
That's my matrix right there.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,340
And I could just write it as a
series of n column vectors, so

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,520
it could be a1, a2,
all the way to an.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,590
Now, let's say that I have
some other vector b.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,540
Let's say b is a member of
the column space of A.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,880
Remember, the column space is
just the set of all of the

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,830
vectors that can be represented
as a linear

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,200
combination of the columns of A,
so that means that b can be

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,230
represented as a linear
combination of

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,280
the columns of A.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
So I'll just write the constant
factors as x1 times

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:58,800
a1 plus x2 times a2, all the way
to plus xn times an, where

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,830
x1, x2, xn, they're all just
arbitrary real numbers.

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:11,550
Another way to state this is
that that means that a, which

17
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,560
I could write as a1, a2, all
the way to an, times some

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:26,400
vector x1, x2, all the way
to xn, is equal to b.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,940
These two statements
are equivalent.

20
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,110
We know that b is a member
of the column space.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,120
That means that b can be
represented as a linear

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,660
combination of the columns of
A, and that this statement

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,320
right here can be rewritten
this way.

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:48,940
So you can write that the
equation Ax equals b has at

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:58,910
least one solution x that
is a member of Rn.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,070
And the entries of x would
represent the weights on the

27
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,210
column vectors of A to get your
linear combination b.

28
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,970
This is all a bit of review.

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,490
Now, let's draw Rn.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,050
Any solution to this equation
right here is going to be a

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,940
member of Rn.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,920
Remember, this is an
m-by-n matrix.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,320
We had n columns and this has
to be a member of Rn right

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,380
there, so let's draw Rn.

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,650
So Rn maybe looks like
that, so that is Rn.

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,070
And let's look at some of the
subspaces that we have in Rn.

37
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,290
We have the null space.

38
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,740
That's going to be in Rn.

39
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,600
The null space is all of the
solutions to the equation Ax

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,830
is equal to 0.

41
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,980
That's going to be in Rn.

42
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,020
It's all of the x's that satisfy
that equation, so let

43
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,240
me draw that right here.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,140
So let's say I have the null
space right there, so that is

45
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,720
the null space of A.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,870
And then what else
do we have in Rn?

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,340
Well, we have the orthogonal
complement of the

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,960
null space of A.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,550
Let me draw that.

50
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,702
So we have the orthogonal
complement-- let me doing it

51
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,260
in a different color.

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,750
We have the orthogonal
complement of the null space

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,130
of A, which we can also
call-- we learned

54
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,160
this in the last video.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,700
This is also going to be equal
to the row space of A, which

56
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,090
is also just the column space.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,190
   

58
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,780
The row space of A is the column
space of A transpose.

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,580
So we have two spaces here.

60
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,780
That is the row space of A.

61
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,730
So I have two subsets of Rn.

62
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,320
I have the null space and then
I have the null space's

63
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,810
complement, orthogonal
complement, which is the row

64
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,080
space of A.

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,150
Now, we've seen in several
videos now, and I proved it I

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,490
think two videos ago, that
any vector in Rn can be

67
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:04,750
represented as a sum of a member
of our null space,

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,620
let's call that vector n, and
let's say some vector in our

69
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,430
row space, let's call
that vector r.

70
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,470
Any vector in Rn can be
represented as a sum of some

71
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,920
vector in our null space and
some vector in our row space.

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,590
So any solution to this equation
is a member of Rn so

73
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,190
it must be able to be
represented by some member of

74
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,630
our null space and some member
of our row space.

75
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,000
So let's write that down.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:47,630
So let's say x is a solution
to Ax equals b, which also

77
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,670
means that x is a member of Rn,
so because it's a member

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,950
of Rn, we can represent it as
a combination of one vector

79
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,970
here and one vector there.

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:11,460
So let's say that x is equal
to some vector r0, plus n0,

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:26,190
where r0 is a member of our row
space and n0 is a member

82
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,140
of the row space's orthogonal
complement.

83
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,510
They are the orthogonal
complements of each other, so

84
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,760
n0 is a member of
our null space.

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,730
Fair enough.

86
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,140
Now, one thing we might wonder
is, clearly this vector isn't

87
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,950
a solution to Ax equals b.

88
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,430
This vector is a solution
to Ax is equal to 0.

89
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,670
But we might be curious as to
whether this solution right

90
00:05:52,670 --> 00:06:00,870
here, this member of our row
space is a solution to Ax is

91
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,780
equal to b.

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,440
This is kind of what we're
focused on in this.

93
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,260
So let's solve for
r0 right here.

94
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,560
So if we solve for r0, if we
subtract n0 from both sides,

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,360
we get r0 is equal
to x minus n0.

96
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,840
All I did was subtract n0 from
both sides and I switched

97
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,410
things around.

98
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,040
I solved for r0.

99
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,180
Now, if we multiply, A times
r0 is equal to A times this

100
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,030
whole thing-- let me switch
colors-- that's equal to A

101
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:47,770
times x0 minus n0, which is
equal to Ax minus An0.

102
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,550
And what is this equal to?

103
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,910
Well, A times x, we already said
that x is a solution to

104
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,450
Ax equals b, so this
right here is going

105
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,410
to be equal to b.

106
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,790
And n0 is a member of our null
space, which means it

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,070
satisfies this solution right
here, that A times any member

108
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,850
of our null space is going to
be equal to the zero vector.

109
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,150
So that's going to be equal
to the zero vector.

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,350
So you have the vector b minus
the zero vector, and you're

111
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,760
just going to have
the vector b.

112
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,510
So we just found out that A
times this member of our row

113
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,400
space-- let's call that
r0, that's that

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,390
guy right there maybe.

115
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,380
A times r0 is equal to b.

116
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,350
So this is a solution.

117
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:42,020
So r0 is a solution to
Ax is equal to b.

118
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,790
So far, it 's kind of an
interesting result that we

119
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,810
have already.

120
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,720
If you give me any vector here
b that is a member of our

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,320
column space, then there is
going to be some member of our

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:03,370
row space right here that is a
solution to Ax is equal to b.

123
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,140
Now, the next question you might
wonder is, is this the

124
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,720
only guy in our row space
that is a solution to

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Ax is equal to b?

126
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,650
And to prove that,
let's assume that

127
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,300
there's another guy here.

128
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:23,380
Let's say that r1 is a member
of our row space and a

129
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:30,440
solution to Ax is equal to b.

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,620
Now, the row space is a valid
subspace, so if I take the sum

131
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,409
or the difference of any two
vectors in the row space, I'll

132
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,240
get another member
of the row space.

133
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,320
That's one of the requirements
for being a valid subspace.

134
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,520
So let's see this.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,180
So if I take two members of our
subspace, so if I take r1

136
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,710
minus r0 and I take their
difference, which is just the

137
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,940
sum-- well, you multiply 1 times
the negative and that

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,700
has to be a member of the
subspace when you're summing

139
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,380
them, so this has to be a
member of our subspace.

140
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:09,000
So this must also be a member
of our of our row space.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,630
That's because our row space
is a valid subspace.

142
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,960
You get two of its members, you
take its difference, that

143
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,230
also has to be a member.

144
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,170
Fair enough.

145
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,270
Now, let's see what
happens when you

146
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,170
multiply this guy by A.

147
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,570
So if I take A times r1 minus
r0, what do I get?

148
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,300
I get A times r1 minus
A times r0.

149
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,770
We already figured out, or for
r1 we assumed that it is a

150
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,230
solution to Ax is equal to b,
and r0, we already found out,

151
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,890
it is a solution to
Ax equal to b.

152
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,670
So either of these, when
you multiply them by

153
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,580
A, it equals b.

154
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,520
So this equals b and that equals
b, so you get b minus

155
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,140
b, which is the zero vector.

156
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,710
Now, this is interesting.

157
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,440
This tells us that r minus r0 is
a solution to the equation

158
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,770
Ax is equal to 0, right?

159
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,110
When I put r1 minus r0 in the
place of x right there and I

160
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,550
multiplied it times
the A, I got 0.

161
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:16,060
I got 0, which implies that r1
minus r0, that this vector is

162
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,440
a member of our null space.

163
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,220
So I have a vector here that's
a member of my row space, and

164
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,540
we got that from the fact that
both of these are members of

165
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,150
our row space and the row space
is closed under addition

166
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,630
and subtraction, and the vector
r1 minus r0 is a member

167
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,910
of my null space.

168
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,040
And we've seen this several
times already.

169
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,100
If I have a vector that is in
a subspace and it's also in

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,302
the orthogonal complement of the
subspace, the null space

171
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:52,570
is also the orthogonal
complement of the row space,

172
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,750
then the only possible
vector that that can

173
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,130
be is the zero vector.

174
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,300
That's the only vector that's
inside of a subspace and it's

175
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,250
orthogonal complement or a
subspace and it's orthogonal

176
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,810
complement.

177
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,270
These two guys are
the orthogonal

178
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,300
complements of each other.

179
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,040
We drew it up here.

180
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,190
So we get that r1 one
minus r0 must be

181
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,410
equal to the zero vector.

182
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,830
That's the only vector that's
in a subspace and its

183
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:23,910
orthogonal complement,
which implies that r1

184
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,955
must be equal to r0.

185
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:28,700
When we take the difference,
we get the zero vector.

186
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,925
So we have a couple of
neat results here.

187
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:33,430
   

188
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,020
What do we know so far?

189
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,270
We know that if we have some
vector b that is a member of

190
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:50,420
our column space of A,
then there exists a

191
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,920
unique member, right?

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,180
We just proved the uniqueness.

193
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,050
There exists a unique member
of the row space of A.

194
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,190
Let me write it.

195
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,910
Let me do it in a
different color.

196
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:16,720
Of the row space of A, so this
is the row space of A such

197
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,320
that a unique member of the
row space of A, let

198
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,450
me call that r0.

199
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,100
Let me do it in a
different color.

200
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,120
I want to make this really
stand out in your brain.

201
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:38,030
So we know that r0 is a member
of the row space of A such

202
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:57,400
that r0 is a solution
to Ax is equal to b.

203
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,530
It's a little bit of a complex
statement here, but it's

204
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,040
interesting.

205
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,917
You give me any b that's a
member of the column space of

206
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:06,730
A, then there will exist a
unique member of the row space

207
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,300
of A, that's my unique member of
the row space of A, that is

208
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,710
a solution to Ax
is equal to b.

209
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,250
Now, we can go further
with this.

210
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,010
We can go further.

211
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:23,660
We wrote up here that any
solution to this equation Ax

212
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,110
is equal to b can be written as
a sum of r0 plus n0, where

213
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,250
r0 is a member of our row space
and n0 is a member of

214
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,450
our null space, and that's
because we have a subspace and

215
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,405
its orthogonal complement.

216
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:38,990
So any member of Rn can be
represented as a sum of a

217
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,480
subspace and a member of the
subspace's orthogonal

218
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,190
complement.

219
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,790
Let me rewrite that down here.

220
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:59,310
So we already said that any
solution x to Ax is equal to b

221
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:10,330
can be written as a
combination-- let me write it

222
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,520
this way-- as a combination
of r0 plus n0.

223
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,950
Fair enough.

224
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,560
Now, what happens if I wanted
to take the square of the

225
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,620
length of x on both
sides of that.

226
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,700
Let me write this down, and
you'll see why I'm writing

227
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,890
this, because I have
another interesting

228
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,040
result to show you.

229
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,810
So if I were take the square
of any solution to this

230
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,200
equation right here, well,
that's going to be the same

231
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,640
thing as x dot x, which is the
same thing as this thing dot

232
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:55,590
itself, same thing as r0
plus n0 dot r0 plus n0.

233
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,330
And what is this equal to?

234
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:12,550
This is equal to r0 dot r0 plus
n0 dot r0 plus n0 dot r0

235
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:18,270
again plus n0 dot n0.

236
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,000
   

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,870
I just kind of foiled it out and
we can do that because we

238
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,110
know the dot product exhibits
the distributive property.

239
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,900
So this thing right here
is equal to the

240
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,310
length of r0 squared.

241
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:41,070
Now, we're going to have--
what is n0 dot r0?

242
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,340
We don't even have to simplify
this much more. n0 is a member

243
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,580
of our null space.

244
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,340
r0 is a member of
our row space.

245
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,860
Each of them is in a subspace
that is the orthogonal

246
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,120
complement of the other, which
means that everything here

247
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,610
dotted with anything in
here is equal to 0.

248
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,940
So r0 dot n0 is going
to be equal to 0.

249
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,340
These guys are orthogonal to
each other, so that's going to

250
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,300
be equal to 0, that's going to
be equal to 0, and then you

251
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,790
get plus-- what's this? n0 dot
n0 is just the length of the

252
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,160
vector n0 squared.

253
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,210
These are all vectors.

254
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:21,360
And so we get the length of the
vector x squared is equal

255
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,490
to the length of our member of
our row space squared, our

256
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,150
unique member of our row space
squared, plus that member of

257
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,670
our null space squared.

258
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,670
Now, this is definitely going
to be a positive number.

259
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,140
It's at minimum 0, but it has to
be something larger than 0,

260
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,200
so we can say that this
quantity right here is

261
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:47,730
definitely greater than or
equal to just r0 squared.

262
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,500
Or another way to think about
it is, you give me any

263
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:59,490
solution to the equation Ax is
equal to b, and the square of

264
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,620
its length is going to be
greater than or equal to the

265
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,020
square of r0's length.

266
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,910
Or since both of the lengths are
always positive, you can

267
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,099
take kind of the positive square
root and you know you

268
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,270
won't have to switch signs
there, that the length of any

269
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,440
solution to Ax equals b is going
to be greater than or

270
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,730
equal to the length of r0.

271
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,810
So that makes r0 kind of
a special solution.

272
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,200
So now let's write our entire
statement, everything that

273
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,450
we've learned in this video.

274
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,340
   

275
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,580
So if b is a member of the
column space of A, then there

276
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:54,670
exists a unique r0 that is a
member of the row space of A,

277
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:07,370
such that r0 is a solution
to Ax is equal to b.

278
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,880
And not only is it a solution,
it's a special solution.

279
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:22,500
r0 is the solution with the
least, or no solution has a

280
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,560
smaller length than r0.

281
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,330
Let me write it that way.

282
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,800
Maybe some other solution could
be equal but could have

283
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,190
the same length.

284
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:47,600
And no other solution can
have a smaller length.

285
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,035
Maybe we could write that if you
give me any vector b that

286
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,860
is a member of the column space
of A, then there exists

287
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,300
a unique member of the row space
that is essentially the

288
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,800
smallest solution.

289
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,210
You can write small as having
the least length to Ax is

290
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,200
equal to b, which is a
pretty neat outcome.

291
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,480
In the next video, we'll
explore this a

292
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,640
little bit more visually.

293
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:11,866
