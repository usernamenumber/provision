1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
   

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,980
I received a suggestion that I
do actual old AP exam problems,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,550
and I looked on the internet
and lo and behold, on the

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,640
college board site, if you go
to collegeboard.com, you can

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,380
actually get-- I couldn't find
the actual multiple choice

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,760
questions, but you can find the
free response questions, and so

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,790
this question is actually the
first free response question

8
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,060
that they have on the calculus
BC that was administered

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,620
just recently in 2008.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,990
So let's do this problem.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,140
And frankly, if you understand
how to do all of the free

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,200
response questions, you
probably will do fairly well on

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,840
the multiple choice, because
the free response tend to be a

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,980
little bit more challenging,
especially the last parts

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,260
of the free response.

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,110
Well anyway, let's do this one.

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,205
So I'll just read it out,
because I don't want to write

18
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,300
it out all here, but this
is the actual diagram.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,250
I actually copied and pasted
this from the PDF that they

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,360
provide on collegeboard.com.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,630
So it says, let r-- this is r--
be the region bounded by the

22
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,390
graphs of y equals
sine pi of x.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,850
So let me write that down.

24
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:09,116
So this top graph is y
is equal to sine pi x.

25
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:22,860
   

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,060
and then the bottom graph is y
is equal to x cubed minus 4x.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:37,410
   

28
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,320
And how did I know that
this was the bottom one?

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,780
Well I knew that this one
was sine of pi x, right?

30
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,840
Because sine looks like this.

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,910
It doesn't look
like that, right?

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,280
When you go sine of pi
is 0, sine of 0 is

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,380
0, sine of 2pi is 0.

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,760
So we do this as sine of pi x.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Well anyway, they want-- so
this is the region between

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,110
these two functions and part A
of this-- and this is kind of

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,890
the softball question, just to
make sure that you know how to

38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,040
do definite integrals-- and
it says, find the area of r.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,890
So how do we do that?

40
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,800
I think you know that we're
going to do a little definite

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,290
integration, so let's do that.

42
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,780
So then we're going to take the
definite integral, so let's

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:23,280
just say the area is equal to--
I don't know if that's-- I hope

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,140
I'm writing big enough for
you-- the area is going to be

45
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,960
equal to the definite
integral from.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,150
So what are the x values?

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,266
We're going to be going
from x is equal to 0

48
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:34,540
to x is equal to 2.

49
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,890
   

50
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,330
And what's this?

51
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,510
At any given point value of x,
what is kind of going to be the

52
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,990
high-- when we're taking the
area, we're taking a bunch of

53
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,850
rectangles that are
of dx width, right?

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,900
So that's-- that's not dark
enough, I don't think that

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,750
you can see that-- so that's
one of my rectangles.

56
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,890
Whoops.

57
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,730
Let's say that's one of my
rectangles right here that

58
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,070
I'm going to be summing up.

59
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,110
Its width is dx.

60
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,220
What's its height?

61
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,440
Its height is going to be
this top function minus

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,340
this bottom function.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,240
So, essentially, we're going to
take the sum of all of these

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,710
rectangles, so its height is
going to be-- let me switch

65
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,670
colors arbitrarily-- the height
is going to be the top function

66
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,500
minus the bottom function.

67
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:35,060
So sine of pi x-- parentheses
here-- minus the

68
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,720
bottom function.

69
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,250
So minus x cubed plus 4x.

70
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,810
   

71
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,270
Since I'm subtracting, I
switched both of these signs.

72
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,010
And all of that times the width
of each of these little

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,670
rectangles-- which is
infinitely small-- dx.

74
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,810
And we're going to sum them
all up from x is equal

75
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,510
to 0 to x is equal to 2.

76
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,610
This should be fairly
straightforward for you.

77
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,850
So how do we evaluate this?

78
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,080
Well, we essentially take the
antiderivative of this and

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,870
then evaluate that at 2
and then evaluate at 0.

80
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,590
What's the antiderivative
of sine of pi x?

81
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,900
Well, what functions
derivative is sine of x.

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
Cosine of x-- let's see.

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,420
If I were to take the
derivative of cosine-- let's

84
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,960
say I took the derivative
of cosine pi x.

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,090
This should be reasonably
familiar to you.

86
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,590
Cosine of pi x, if I were
to take the derivative

87
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,200
of it, what do I get?

88
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,320
That equals pi.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,980
You take the derivative
of the inside, right?

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,120
By the chain rule.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,130
So it's pi times the derivative
of the whole thing.

92
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,230
The derivative of cosine of x
is minus sine of x, so the

93
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:54,440
derivative to this is going to
be times minus sine of pi x, or

94
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:02,080
you could say that equals
minus pi sine of pi x.

95
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,810
So the derivative of cosine of
pi x is almost this, it just

96
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,270
has that minus pi there, right?

97
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,150
So let's see if we can rewrite
this so it looks just like the

98
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,440
derivative of cosine pi x.

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,690
And I'll switch to magenta.

100
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,730
   

101
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,400
I want to make sure I
have enough space to do

102
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,225
this entire problem.

103
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:27,180
   

104
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:36,880
So let's write a minus 1
over pi times a minus pi.

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,020
All I did, when you evaluate
this, this equals 1, so I can

106
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:48,100
do this times sine pi x, and
then that's minus x to the

107
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,370
third plus 4x, and then all
of that times the width dx.

108
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,200
Well now we have it.

109
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,810
We know that the antiderivative
of this is cosine pi x, right?

110
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,910
And this is just
a constant term.

111
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,370
So what's the antiderivative
of this whole thing?

112
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,780
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors again.

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,070
The antiderivative
is cosine pi x.

114
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:18,620
So we have minus 1 over pi
cosine pi x-- remember, I could

115
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,320
just carry this over, this is
just a constant term-- this

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,590
antiderivative is
this right here.

117
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,330
And then these are a little
bit more straightforward.

118
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,770
So minus the antiderivative of
x to the third is x to the

119
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:41,300
fourth over 4 plus the
antiderivative of this is 4x

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,250
squared over 2, or you could
just view that as 2x squared,

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,620
and then we're going to
evaluate that at 2 and at

122
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,260
0, and let's do that.

123
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:03,510
So this is equal to cosine of
2pi, and we'll have a minus

124
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,930
sign out here, so minus cosine
of 2pi over pi, minus-- what's

125
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,680
2 to the fourth power?

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:11,960
Let's see.

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,170
2 to the third is 8, 2 the
fourth is 16, 16 over 4 is 4,

128
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:26,750
so it's minus 4, 2 squared is
4 times 2 is 8, so plus 8, so

129
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,020
that's the antiderivative
evaluated at 2, and now let's

130
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,460
subtract it evaluated at 0.

131
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:46,470
So this will be minus cosine of
0 over pi-- all right, that's

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,630
that evaluated at 0--
minus 0, plus 0.

133
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,540
So these terms don't
contribute anything when

134
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,880
you evaluate them at 0.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,250
And so what do we get?

136
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,620
What's cosine of 2pi?

137
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,110
Cosine of 2pi is the
same thing as cosine

138
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,090
of 0, and it equals 1.

139
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,490
What is the x value of the
unit circle at 2pi, or at 0?

140
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,070
It's equal to 1.

141
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:15,670
So this equals minus 1 over pi
minus 4 plus 8, and so this

142
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,900
minus minus, those both become
pluses, cosine of 0 is also 1,

143
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,840
so plus 1 over pi, and so this
minus 1 over pi and this plus 1

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,570
over pi will cancel out, and
all we're left with is minus 4

145
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,210
plus 8 and that is equal to 4.

146
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:42,830
So that is part one, part A of
number one, on the 2008 DC

147
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,920
free response questions.

148
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,090
It actually took me a whole
video just to do that part.

149
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,550
In the next video, I'll do part
B, and we'll just keep doing

150
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,115
this, and I'll try to do a
couple of these every day.

151
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,690
See you soon.

152
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,333
