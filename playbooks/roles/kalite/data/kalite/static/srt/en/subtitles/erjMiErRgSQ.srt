1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
   

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,300
In the last video we hopefully
learned the intuition behind

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,450
the ideal gas equation, that
pressure times volume is equal

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,540
to the number of molecules we
have times some constant times

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,620
the temperature.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,740
And that's all nice and it
hopefully it makes sense to

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,100
you how all of these
fit together.

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,350
That pressure should be inverse
to volume and that's

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,570
why you're multiplying both
sides by each other.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,720
You could take volume
and put it on

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,520
this side of the equation.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,440
Or that pressure should be
proportional to the number of

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,060
particles and the temperature.

14
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,280
But now let's apply it and
actually do some problems.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,720
Because just knowing this
isn't good enough.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:48,036
So let's say that I have a two
liter container, or let's say

17
00:00:48,036 --> 00:01:03,170
a two liter balloon, containing
hydrogen gas.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,250
And that's hydrogen as
a diatomic molecule.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,570
So each molecule has two
hydrogens in it.

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:19,090
And let's say I'm measuring
it at 30 degrees Celsius.

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,480
My brain is really
malfunctioning.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,480
   

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,530
And let's say that the pressure
on the outside of the

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,560
balloon, we've measured
at two atmospheres.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,000
   

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,550
So my question to you
is how many moles of

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,800
hydrogen do we have?

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:55,790
   

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,020
So let's apply our ideal
gas equation.

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,440
And since we're dealing with
liters and atmospheres, we

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,570
have to make sure
we use the right

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,820
proportionality constant.

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,370
   

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,780
So our pressure is given
in atmospheres.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,330
Let me write down all
the units, actually.

36
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:24,460
So we have 2 atmospheres times
our volume is 2 liters, is

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,020
equal to n.

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,230
n is the number of particles
we care about, and we care

39
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,870
about it in moles, but let's
just write n there for now.

40
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,100
Is equal to n times R.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,900
   

42
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,220
I'll do R in a second.

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,870
Times T.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,700
Now you might be tempted to just
put 30 degrees in there.

45
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,220
But in all of these problems--
in fact in general, whenever

46
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,040
you're doing any of these gas
problems or thermodynamics

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
problems, or any time you're
doing math with temperature--

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,900
you should always convert
into Kelvin.

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,140
And just as a bit of review as
to what Kelvin is, it's just a

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,030
different scale.

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,220
So for example, the lowest
possible temperature that that

52
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,380
can be achieved in the universe,
when you think about

53
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,620
it in Celsius, let me draw a
little temperature scale here.

54
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,120
So if that's the temperature
scale.

55
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,070
I'll draw two, one for Celsius
and one for Kelvin.

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,250
So the lowest possible
temperature that can be

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,970
achieved in the universe, and
when we say the lowest

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,850
possible temperature that means
that the average kinetic

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,480
energy of the molecules
or the atoms are zero.

60
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,980
They're just not moving.

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,690
They're just stationary.

62
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:49,900
So in Celsius, it's minus
273.15 degrees Celsius.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,910
So zero might be some
place over here.

64
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,730
Zero, that's where
water freezes.

65
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,620
And then 100 degrees, that's
where water boils.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,560
And you can immediately see,
the whole Celsius scale was

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,530
made based on the freezing
point and the

68
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,230
boiling point of water.

69
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,420
So look at this and you say, if
I have something that's 5

70
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,870
degrees and I have another thing
that's 10 degrees, when

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,079
you look at the Celsius scale,
you're like, oh, maybe the 10

72
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,089
degree thing it has twice
as much energy as

73
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,899
the 5 degree thing.

74
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,370
It has twice the temperature.

75
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,380
But when you look at it from the
absolute distance to zero.

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,750
   

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,880
Let me see if I can draw this.

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,970
So the 10 degree is all the way
over here and the 5 degree

79
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,050
is almost as far.

80
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,630
So the 10 degrees Celsius is
only a slight increment over 5

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,090
degrees Celsius, if you were
to divide the two.

82
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,830
It's not twice as hot.

83
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,660
And that's why they came up
with the Kelvin scale.

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,795
Because in the Kelvin scale,
absolute zero is defined as 0.

85
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:51,410
   

86
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,520
So this right here is
zero degrees Kelvin.

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,510
And so zero degrees Kelvin
is absolute zero.

88
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,100
So what is zero degrees
Celsius?

89
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,870
And the increments
are the same.

90
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,350
One degree change in
Celsius is one

91
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,590
degree change in Kelvin.

92
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,500
So at least they keep it,
it's just a shift.

93
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,620
So this is going to be plus
273 degrees Kelvin.

94
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,670
And then 5 degrees would be plus
278; ' 10 degrees would

95
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,260
be plus 283 Kelvin.

96
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,790
And then you see that 5 and 10
degrees really aren't that

97
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,900
different from each other.

98
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,510
But in general, if you want to
convert from Celsius to Kelvin

99
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,350
you just add 273 degrees.

100
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,590
So 30 degrees Celsius is what?

101
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,740
Well, this 5 and 10 I drew
too close to 100.

102
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,400
But let's say it's
sitting here.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,850
It would be 303 degrees
Kelvin.

104
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,380
   

105
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,630
All right, so now for our
temperature, that's what we

106
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,250
were worried about.

107
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,990
We wanted to put in the
temperature there.

108
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,820
So now we can put in our
303 degrees Kelvin.

109
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,240
Now we have to figure out what
constant to use here.

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
And I've written a couple
of down here.

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,950
Remember, we're dealing with
atmospheres and liters.

112
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,080
So I wrote down a couple of
versions of R right here.

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,530
Let's see we're dealing with
atmospheres and liters.

114
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,960
And in the denominator we're
always dealing with mole and

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,060
Kelvin no matter what.

116
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,280
So those are always
going to be there.

117
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,640
So we should use this
proportionality constant.

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,620
R is equal to 0.082 liter
atmospheres per mole Kelvin.

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,210
Let me write that down.

120
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,870
So let me rewrite our whole
equation actually.

121
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,420
So I have 2 atmospheres times 2
liters is equal to n times,

122
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:51,290
I have a bad memory, 0.082 liter
atmospheres per mole

123
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:57,750
Kelvin, times 303
degrees Kelvin.

124
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,350
So let's see what we can do.

125
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,940
Let's see if all of the
units work out.

126
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,520
So we can always, when you do
dimensional analysis, you can

127
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,340
treat units like numbers.

128
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,770
So if you divide both sides of
this equation by atmospheres,

129
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,720
the atmospheres cancel out.

130
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,260
Divide both sides of this
equation by liters, liters

131
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,230
cancel out.

132
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,400
You have a Kelvin in the
numerator, Kelvin in the

133
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
denominator, that cancels out.

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,200
And so we have 2 times
2 is equal to n

135
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:34,910
times 0.082 times 303.

136
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,740
And then we have just a per mole
and a 1 over the mole.

137
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,030
So to solve for n, or the number
of moles, what we do is

138
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,570
we divide both sides of this
equation by all of this stuff.

139
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:53,720
So we get 2 times 2 is 4.

140
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:01,260
4 divided by 0.082
divided by 303.

141
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,110
I'm just taking this and putting
it on the left-hand

142
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,870
side, dividing both
sides by it.

143
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,665
And when you divide by a per
mole, if you put a 1 over a

144
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:08,890
mole here, that's the
same thing as

145
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,140
multiplying by a mole.

146
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,010
   

147
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,340
So it's good, the units
all worked out.

148
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,460
We're getting n in
terms of moles.

149
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,890
And so we just have to get the
calculator out and figure out

150
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,100
how many moles we're
dealing with.

151
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,590
So we have 4 divided
by 0.082 divided by

152
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,080
303 is equal to 0.16.

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,960
If we wanted to go more
digits, .161,

154
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,500
but we'll just round.

155
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:45,430
So this is equal to
0.16 moles of H2.

156
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,010
I am telling you actually here,
the exact number of

157
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,280
hydrogen molecules.

158
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,840
But if you wanted a number,
you'd just multiply this times

159
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,810
6.02 times 10 to the 23 and then
you would have a number

160
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,930
in kind of the traditional
sense.

161
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,990
And of course, if you wanted
to know what is the mass of

162
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,600
the hydrogen you have. You'd
say, OK well one mole of H2

163
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,850
has a mass of what?

164
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,680
   

165
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,550
The mass of one hydrogen is
one atomic mass unit.

166
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,250
The mass of two hydrogen when
it's in its molecular form, is

167
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,580
two atomic mass units.

168
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,650
So a mole of it is going
to be 2 grams.

169
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,270
So in this case, we
have 0.16 moles.

170
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,490
So if we wanted to convert that
to grams, this in the

171
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:41,310
case of these hydrogen gas
molecules would be 0.32 grams.

172
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,100
And I just multiplied it by 2
because each mole is 2 grams.

173
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,510
Anyway, I hope you found
that useful.

174
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,070
I'm going to do a bunch more
of these problems.

175
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,420
Because I think the math is
pretty straightforward here.

176
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,320
The thing that always makes it
daunting, I think, is the

177
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,610
units and making sure you're
using the right units.

178
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,990
What is they are using meters
cubed instead of liters, or

179
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,040
kilopascals instead
of atmospheres.

180
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,420
So I'll try to do a bunch of
examples where we use all the

181
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,820
different units and you're able
to pick our constants

182
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,070
appropriately.

183
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,410
