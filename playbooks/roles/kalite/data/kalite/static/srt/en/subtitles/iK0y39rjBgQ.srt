1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,050
Write 14,897 in expanded form.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,165
Let me just rewrite the number,
and I'll color code

3
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:10,650
it, and that way, we can keep
track of our digits.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,470
So we have 14,000.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,430
I don't have to write
it-- well, let me

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,410
write it that big.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:31,150
14,000, 800, and 97-- I already
used the blue; maybe I

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,990
should use yellow--
in expanded form.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,070
So let's think about
what place each of

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,480
these digits are in.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,160
This right here, the 7,
is in the ones place.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,450
The 9 is in the tens place.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,556
This literally represents 9
tens, and we're going to see

14
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,080
this in a second.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,250
This literally represents
7 ones.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,500
The 8 is in the hundreds
place.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,500
The 4 is in the thousands
place.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,170
It literally represents 4,000.

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,800
And then the 1 is in the
ten-thousands place.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,210
And you see, every time you move
to the left, you move one

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,540
place to the left, you're
multiplying by 10.

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,260
Ones place, tens place, hundreds
place, thousands

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,500
place, ten-thousands place.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,570
Now let's think about what
that really means.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,940
If this 1 is in the
ten-thousands place, that

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:40,790
means that it literally
represents-- I want to do this

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,520
in a way that my arrows
don't get mixed up.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,020
Actually, let me start
at the other end.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,970
Let me start with what
the 7 represents.

30
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,820
The 7 literally represents
7 ones.

31
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,510
Or another way to think about
it, you could say it

32
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,920
represents 7 times 1.

33
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,000
All of these are equivalent.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,150
They represent 7 ones.

35
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,640
Now let's think about the 9.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,450
That's why I'm doing it from the
right, so that the arrows

37
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,220
don't have to cross
each other.

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,385
So what does the 9 represent?

39
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,720
It represents 9 tens.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,530
You could literally imagine
you have 9 actual tens.

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,270
You could have a 10, plus
a 10, plus a 10.

42
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,820
Do that nine times.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,300
That's literally what it
represents: 9 actual tens.

44
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,720
9 tens, or you could say it's
the same thing as 9 times 10,

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,280
or 90, either way you want
to think about it.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,060
So let me write all
the different ways

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,620
to think about it.

48
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,330
It represents all of these
things: 9 tens, or 9

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,100
times 10, or 90.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,430
So then we have our 8.

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,250
Our 8 represents-- we see it's
in the hundreds place.

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,570
It represents 8 hundreds.

53
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,880
8 hundreds

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,210
Or you could view that as being
equivalent to 8 times

55
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,570
100-- a hundred, not
a thousand-- 8

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,140
times 100, or 800.

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,130
That 8 literally represents
8 hundreds, 800.

58
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,540
And then the 4.

59
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,350
I think you get the idea here.

60
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,110
This represents the
thousands place.

61
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,270
It represents 4 thousands, which
is the same thing as 4

62
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,950
times 1,000, which is the
same thing as 4,000.

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,350
4,000 is the same thing
as 4 thousands.

64
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,420
Add it up.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,520
And then finally, we have this
1, which is sitting in the

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,730
ten-thousands place, so it
literally represents 1

67
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,980
ten-thousand.

68
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,010
You can imagine if these were
chips, kind of poker chips,

69
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,700
that would represent one of the
blue poker chips and each

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
blue poker chip represents
10,000.

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know if that
helps you or not.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,330
And 1 ten-thousand is the same
thing as 1 times 10,000 which

73
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,020
is the same thing as 10,000.

74
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,020
So when they ask us to write it
in expanded form, we could

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,020
write 14,897 literally as the
sum of these numbers, of its

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,270
components, or we could
write it as the

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,820
sum of these numbers.

78
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,740
Actually, let me write this.

79
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,340
This top 7 times 1 is
just equal to 7.

80
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:29,710
So 14,897 is the same thing as
10,000 plus 4,000 plus 800

81
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:39,220
plus 90 plus 7.

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,620
So you could consider this
expanded form, or you could

83
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,330
use this version of it, or you
could say this the same thing

84
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,860
as 1 times 10,000, depending on
what people consider to be

85
00:04:48,860 --> 00:05:02,860
expanded form-- plus 4 times
1,000 plus 8 times 100 plus 9

86
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,160
times 10 plus 7 times 1.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,930
I'll scroll to the right
a little bit.

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,910
So either of these could be
considered expanded form.
