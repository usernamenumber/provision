1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:07,800
We have the equation 20 minus
7 times x is equal to 6

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,650
times x minus 6.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,680
And we need to solve for x.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,180
So the way I like to do these
is we just like to separate

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,950
the constant terms, which are
the 20 and the negative 6 on

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,200
one side of the equation.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,710
I'll put them on the
right-hand side.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,610
And then we'll put all the x
terms, the negative 7x and the

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,260
6x, we'll put it all on
the left-hand side.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,590
So to get the 20 out of the way
from the left-hand side,

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,130
let's subtract it.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,030
Let's subtract it from
the left-hand side.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,690
But this is an equation,
anything you do to the

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,960
left-hand side, you also have to
do to the right-hand side.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,930
If that is equal to that, in
order for them to still be

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,160
equal, anything I do to the
left-hand side I have to do to

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,350
the right-hand side.

19
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,510
So I subtracted 20 from the
left, let me also subtract 20

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,990
from the right.

21
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,390
And so the left-hand side
of the equation, 20

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,880
minus 20 is just 0.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,660
That was the whole point,
they cancel out.

24
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,940
Don't have to write it down.

25
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,510
And then I have a negative 7x,
it just gets carried down.

26
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,100
   

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,530
And then that is equal to the

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,489
right-hand side of the equation.

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,420
I have a 6x.

30
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm not adding or subtracting
anything to that.

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
But then I have a negative
6 minus 20.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,260
So if I'm already 6 below 0 on
the number line, and I go

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,690
another 20 below that, that's
at negative 26.

34
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,175
Now, the next thing we want to
do is we want to get all the x

35
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,420
terms on the left-hand side.

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,060
So we don't want this 6x here,
so maybe we subtract 6x from

37
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,936
both sides.

38
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:34,860
So let's subtract 6x from the
right, subtract 6x from the

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,200
left, and what do we get?

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,110
   

41
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,080
The left-hand side, negative
7x minus 6x,

42
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,860
that's negative 13x.

43
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,470
Right?

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,220
Negative 7 of something minus
another 6 of that something is

45
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,450
going to be negative 13
of that something.

46
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,475
And that is going to be
equal to 6x minus 6x.

47
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,400
That cancels out.

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,110
That was the whole point by
subtracting negative 6x.

49
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,520
And then we have just a negative
26, or minus 26,

50
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,500
depending on how you want to
view it, so negative 13x is

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,000
equal to negative 26.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,060
Now, our whole goal, just to
remember, is to isolate the x.

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,470
We have a negative 13
times the x here.

54
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,630
So the best way to isolate it is
if we have something times

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,270
x, if we divide by
that something,

56
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,480
we'll isolate the x.

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,510
So let's divide by
negative 13.

58
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,320
Now, you know by now, anything
you do to the left-hand side

59
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,230
of an equation, you have to
do to the right-hand side.

60
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,890
So we're going to have to
divide both sides of the

61
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,880
equation by negative 13.

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,730
Now, what does the left-hand
side become?

63
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,770
Negative 13 times x divided
by negative 13, that's

64
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,560
just going to be x.

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,650
You multiply something times x,
divide it by the something,

66
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,670
you're just going to
be left with an x.

67
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,880
So the left-hand side
just becomes an x.

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,240
x is equal to negative 26
divided by negative 13.

69
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,260
Well, that's just positive
2, right?

70
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,300
A negative divided by a negative
is a positive.

71
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,240
26 divided by 13 is 2.

72
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,740
And that is our answer.

73
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,270
That is our answer.

74
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,140
Now let's verify that
it really works.

75
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,330
That's the fun thing
about algebra.

76
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,470
You can always make sure that
you got the right answer.

77
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,760
So let's substitute it back into
the original equation.

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:28,580
So we have 20 minus 7 times x--
x is 2-- minus 7 times 2

79
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,590
is equal to 6 times x--
we've solved for x, it

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,310
is 2-- minus 6.

81
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,940
So let's verify that this
left-hand side really does

82
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,690
equal this right-hand side.

83
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,750
So the left-hand side simplifies
to 20 minus 7 times

84
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,390
2, which is 14.

85
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,930
20 minus 14 is 6.

86
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,270
That's what the left-hand
side simplifies to.

87
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,400
The right-hand side, we have 6
times 2, which is 12 minus 6.

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,580
12 minus 6 is 6.

89
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,040
So they are, indeed, equal, and
we did, indeed, get the

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,620
right answer.

91
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,000
