1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Say you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,608
and you're doodling a flowery petaly things,

3
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,907
if you want something with lots of overlapping petals

4
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:07,641
you're probably following a loose sort of rule

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,293
that goes something like this:

6
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:12,358
Add new petals where there are gaps between old petals.

7
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:14,459
You can try doing this precisely starting with

8
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,858
some number of petals, say 5,

9
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,552
then add another layer in between.

10
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,757
But in the next layer you have to add 10,

11
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:21,925
and the next has 20.

12
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,575
The inconvenient part of this is that

13
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,642
you have to finish a layer before everything is even.

14
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:28,329
Ideally you'd have a rule that just let's you add petals

15
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,663
until you get bored.

16
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,194
Now imagine you're a plant and

17
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:33,334
you want to grow in a way that spreads out your leaves

18
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,784
to catch the most possible sunlight.

19
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,218
Unfortunately, and I hope I'm not presuming too much

20
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,753
in thinking that, as a plant, you're not very smart.

21
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:43,923
You don't know how to add numbers to create a series,

22
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,421
you don't know geometry and proportions,

23
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,888
and can't draw spirals or rectangles, or slug cats,

24
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:51,838
but maybe you could follow one simple rule.

25
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,269
Botanists have noticed that plants

26
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:55,301
seem to be fairly consistent, when it comes to

27
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,653
the angle between one leaf and the next.

28
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,231
So let's see what you could do with that.

29
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:00,595
So you grow your first leaf

30
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:01,788
and if you didn't change angle at all,

31
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:04,176
then the next leaf you grow would directly above it.

32
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:05,190
So that's no good because

33
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,655
it blocks out all the light, or something.

34
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,955
You can go 180 degrees,

35
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:10,870
to have the next leaf directly opposite, which seems ideal.

36
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,504
Only once you go 180 again

37
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,488
the third leaf is right over the first.

38
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,287
In fact, any fraction of a circle,

39
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,054
with a whole number as a base, is going to have

40
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:20,483
complete overlap, after that number of turns.

41
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,521
And unlike when you're doodling, as a plant

42
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,235
you're not smart enough to see

43
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:25,289
you've gone all the way around and

44
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,588
should now switch to adding things in between.

45
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,922
If you try and postpone the overlap by making the fraction really small

46
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,358
you just get a ton of overlapping in the beginning

47
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:36,316
and waste all this space, which is completely disastrous.

48
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,239
Or maybe other fractions are good,

49
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,267
the kind that positions leaves in a starlike pattern.

50
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,969
It'll be a while before it overlaps,

51
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,172
and the leafs will be more evenly spaced in the mean time.

52
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,747
But what if there're a fraction that never completely overlapped?

53
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,629
For any rational fraction, eventually the star will close,

54
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,674
but what if you use an irrational number?

55
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:56,834
The kind of number that can't be expressed as whole numbered ratio.

56
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:59,528
What if you used the most irrational number?

57
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,943
If you think it's weird to say that one irrational number

58
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,770
is more irrational than another...

59
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,612
Well you might wanna become a number theorist.

60
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,461
If you're a number theorist, you might tell us that

61
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,311
phi is the most irrational number, or you might say

62
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:13,313
that's like saying of all the integers, 1 is the integeriest,

63
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:14,958
or you might disagree completely.

64
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,380
But anyway, phi ...

65
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,161
is more than one, but less than two;

66
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:20,861
more than 3/2, less than 5/3;

67
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,262
greater than 8/5, but 13/8 is too big.

68
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:26,513
21/13 just a little to small and

69
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,117
34/21 is even close than too big and so on.

70
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:34,059
Each pair of adjacent Fibonacci numbers creates a ratio

71
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:37,295
that gets closer and closer to phi as numbers increase.

72
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:40,210
Those are the same numbers on the sides of these squares.

73
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,425
Now stop being a number theorist and

74
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,795
start being a plant again.

75
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,467
You put your first leaf somewhere

76
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:49,181
and the second leaf at an angle that is 1 phi-th of a circle,

77
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:51,294
which, depending on whether you going one way or the other,

78
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:57,008
could be about 225,5 degrees or about 137,5. Great!

79
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,121
Your second leaf is pretty far from the first,

80
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,491
gets lots of space and sun.

81
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,323
And now let's add the next one of the phi-th of a circle away,

82
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:07,036
and again, and again... You can see how new leaves tend to

83
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:09,798
pop up in the spaces left between old leaves,

84
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,525
but it never quite fills things evenly,

85
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,610
so there's always room for one more leaf,

86
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,607
without having to do a whole new layer.

87
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:18,813
It's very practical, and as a plant you probably like this.

88
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:21,006
It would also be a good way to give lots of room

89
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,875
to see pods and petals and stuff.

90
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,705
As a plant that follows this scheme,

91
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,273
you'd be at an advantage.

92
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,937
Where do the spirals come in?

93
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:30,315
Let's doodle a pinecone using the same method.

94
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:32,591
By the way, you can make your own phi angle-a-tron

95
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,886
by dog-earing a corner of your notebook.

96
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,837
If you folded is so the edges are on a line,

97
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:40,552
you have 45 degrees plus 90, which is 135,

98
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,656
pretty close to 137,5.

99
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,447
If you're careful you can slip in a couple more degrees.

100
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,948
Detach your angle-a-tron and you're good to go.

101
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,611
Add each new pineconey thing a phi-angle around,

102
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:53,062
and make them a little farther out each time,

103
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,245
which you can keep track of

104
00:03:54,245 --> 00:03:56,381
by marking the distance on your angle-a-tron.

105
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,051
Check it out, the spirals form by themselves.

106
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,635
And if you count the number of arms, look, it's 5 and 8.

107
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,501
If you're wondering why spirals would form

108
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,979
and why always with (phi)bonacci numbers,

109
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,989
you could morph back into a number theorist

110
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,127
or geometer, or something.

111
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,595
Here's just a little bit of intuition:

112
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,419
One simple way to doodle a flowers is

113
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,092
to start with a certain number of petals, say 5.

114
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:16,997
And when you go back around, add the next layer

115
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:18,930
close to the first but bigger.

116
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,080
Each layer adds 5 new petals and the 5 arms spiral out.

117
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,539
Looks pretty spiraly to me.

118
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,012
Now go back to phi. You put out 3 petals

119
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,334
before you go back around.

120
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,237
And if I make them really wide

121
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,917
the next lap adds 3 petals that

122
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,503
overlap a bunch with the first, and so on...

123
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,596
If I started with skinnier petals though

124
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:37,421
the second time you go around

125
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,804
it doesn't quite overlap so much and

126
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,145
it takes 8 petals before it goes around twice

127
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,047
and they overlap enough for you to see the spirals.

128
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,762
So this time I get 8 and 13.

129
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:46,930
I mean none of the spirals

130
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,346
are actually physically there, on any of these plants.

131
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,071
It's just the plant bits are close enough

132
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,697
that you can see the pattern.

133
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:53,819
So all a plant needs to do

134
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:55,929
to get awesome Fibonacci numbers of spirals

135
00:04:55,929 --> 00:05:00,346
is add new bits at a 137.5 degree angles.

136
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:03,111
The rest takes care of itself.

137
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,382
That the Fibonacci series is in so many things

138
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,179
really says less about those things

139
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,611
and more about mathematics.

140
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:10,313
I mean, that's what mathematics is all about:

141
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:12,012
simple rules, complex consequences.

142
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,578
A process so easy that even a plant can do it,

143
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:18,013
can turn it into these amazing structures all around us.

144
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,267
Just like a few simple postulates can give us

145
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,362
an incredibly powerful geometry.

146
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,362
I mean that's all assuming that a plant can do it!

147
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:26,261
But measuring the angles between plant bits

148
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,095
you can see that they obviously do do it.

149
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:28,871
Somehow.

150
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,496
I mean it's not like they have angle-a-trons.

151
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,046
But plants have been around a long time,

152
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:33,231
and have had a lot of practice,

153
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,596
so that probably explains everything.

154
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,679
And thus we always get spirals

155
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,206
of 5 and 8 on this flower, 5 and 8 on this artichoke,

156
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,845
5 and 8 on this pinecone.

157
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:46,860
Even this cauliflower has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7... um...

158
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,661
Anyway we always get 1,2,3,4,5,6,7... huh..

159
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,854
And 1,2,3,4!...

160
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,893
It's easy to dismiss these as mutant anomalies.

161

00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:12,955
Maybe things aren't as simple as I thought...
