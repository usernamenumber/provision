00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:03,779
Write the equation of a line that has a slope of one-third,

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,646
and contains the point negative 12, negative 14-thirds.

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,056
So the equation of a line we can write as 'y' is equal to...

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,736
...'mx' plus 'b'. This is in slope-intercept form,

5
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:25,277
where 'm' is our slope, and 'b' right over here is our y-intercept.

6
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:27,719
And they have actually given us our slope.

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,667
Our slope, they tell us, is one-third. So we know that 'm' is going to be one-third,

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:39,863
so we know that 'y' is equal to one-third 'x' plus 'b'.

9
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,030
And so now we just have to solve for 'b',

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,771
and the way we can solve for 'b' is that we know this line contains the point negative 12, negative 14/3.

11
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:59,754
So when 'x' is equal to negative 12, 'y' is equal to negative 14/3.

12
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:13,487
So lets write that down: negative 14/3 is going to be equal to one-third our slope times our 'x' value,

13
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:19,391
which is negative 12 times negative 12, and then plus 'b'.

14
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:25,568
So when 'x' is negative 12, we know that 'y' is equal to negative 14/3,

15
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:29,718
and we also know that the slope is one-third. That's the 'm' in 'mx'+'b'.

16
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,641
So now we can solve for 'b'.

17
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:40,138
The left hand side negative 14/3 is equal to one-third times negative 12.

18
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:48,580
One-third times negative 12 is negative 4, so this is negative 4 plus 'b'.

19
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,621
Let me write that plus 'b' in the same colour that I started with.

20
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:04,010
And now just isolate 'b' on the right hand side, we can add 4 to both sides.

21
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,272
I want to get rid of this negative 4 so lets add 4 to both sides.

22
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:14,846
So plus 4, plus 4, we are left with, on the right hand side, we are left with just a 'b'.

23
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,751
'b' is equal to...

24
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:20,025
On the left hand side we have 4.

25
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:25,718
4 I can re-write because I'm going to have to add 4 to negative 14/3.

26
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:29,318
So I want a common denominator. 4 is the same thing as 12/3,

27
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:36,254
So 4 is 12/3, minus 14/3...

28
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:40,507
...so I just want to be clear: I just re-wrote the 4 as 12/3.

29
00:02:40,753 --> 00:02:47,729
So 12/3 minus 14/3, or negative 14/3 plus 12/3, is going to give us...

30
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:54,442
...we have the same denominator of 3, so we are going to have 12 minus 14 is negative 2.

31
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,964
So we have -2/3 is equal to 'b'.

32
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,846
So the equation of the line we figured out.

33
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:07,372
They gave us the slope and now we just figured out the y-intercept using the information right over here.

34
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:12,072
So the equation of our line is going to be 'y' is equal to one-third 'x'...

35
00:03:12,072 --> 00:03:13,649
...we got the one-third from the problem.

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,872
One-third 'x' plus 'b', 'b' is negative two-thirds...

37
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:21,157
...so I can just write negative 2 over 3.

38
00:03:21,202 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done.
