1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,080
All right, let's see,
we're on page 471.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,670
We'll start with
section 6 now.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:11,630
So let's do the first problem,
and I will do it in magenta.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,620
Problem number one.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:22,840
3 plus diamond over 2 is
equal to 7 and 1/2.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,580
And they say, what number,
when used in the place of

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,870
diamond above, makes
the statement true?

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,320
Well, they're just making the
diamond a variable, right?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,210
So we could just say 3 plus
x over 2-- [? instead ?]

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,790
of an x instead of the diamond,
because that's what

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,960
we're used to-- is equal to--
well, we could write this as a

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,210
decimal if we want, 7.5.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,870
   

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,870
Multiply both sides by
2, so you get 3 plus

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,790
x is equal to 15.

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,200
x is equal to 12.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,360
So that's choice D.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,380
Or we could say diamond is equal
to x is equal to 12.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,640
OK, problem number two.

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,010
They have this thing drawn.

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,860
Let me draw what they drew.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,590
I'll do it in a different
color.

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,840
They have, like, a transversal
here, and then they have one

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,090
line that goes like this.

26
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,590
   

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,040
And then they have another
line that goes

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,070
something like this.

29
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,290
And then, let's see, they
wrote a bunch of stuff.

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:34,500
They wrote, this is angle 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and these

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,360
are lines l and lines m.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,115
And they say in the figure
above, l is parallel to m.

33
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:46,036
All right, parallel lines.

34
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,900
If l is parallel to m, the sum
of the measures of angles 2

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,390
and 4 must equal the sum of the
measures of which of the

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,450
following pairs of angles?

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,325
So the sum of 2 and 4.

38
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:05,220
   

39
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,480
And actually, we know
another thing.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,539
We know that 2 and 4 are equal
to each other, right?

41
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,505
Because they're opposite
angles.

42
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:15,360
But anyway, what angles would
be the same as 2 plus 4?

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,730
Well, we can just do what we
learned in geometry class

44
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,960
about corresponding angles.

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,770
We know that this angle is the
same thing as this angle.

46
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,520
And we actually know that that
angle is also the same thing

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,970
as this angle, because
they're opposite.

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,290
And that first one, we know that
they are because they're

49
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,270
corresponding.

50
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,670
That angle's the same
as this one.

51
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,650
So 2 plus 4 should be the
same thing as 6 plus 8.

52
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,720
And all we used is corresponding
angles to say,

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,870
well, 4 is going to
be the same as 8.

54
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,930
2 is the same as 6.

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,680
And we also know that 6 and
8 are the same, and 2

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,030
and 4 are the same.

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,820
So it's choice D.

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,645
Problem number three.

59
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:59,080
   

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,860
Let me draw this table, because
it looks like we'll

61
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,260
have to use it.

62
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,950
So I have a box here and then
we draw four lines.

63
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:19,290
   

64
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,570
All right, soon. almost there.

65
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:32,170
And then they say, Men,
Women, Total,

66
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:39,490
Employed, Unemployed, Total.

67
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:46,320
And they wrote in the numbers
27,000-- those are 0's--

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:57,590
48,000, 21,500, and 50,500.

69
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,370
In the table above, describing
the Preston City workforce--

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,360
the table is partially filled
in-- based on the information

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,640
in the table, how many women in
the Preston city workforce

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,310
are unemployed?

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,440
So we want to figure out women
that are unemployed.

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,980
We need to figure
out this box.

75
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,190
   

76
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,420
So how do we do that?

77
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,050
Well, first we can figure out
the women that are employed

78
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,020
because there's 48,000
workers.

79
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,990
27,000 are men.

80
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,745
So we just subtract 27,000 from
48,000, so there's going

81
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:34,540
to be 21,000 women.

82
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,090
And then if there's 21,000
women-- I just subtracted--

83
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,270
and-- no, sorry, there's 21,000
employed women, because

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,140
we're in the Employed column--
and there are

85
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,500
21,500 total women.

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,380
Well, then we just
subtract again.

87
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,960
21,500 minus 21,000.

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,610
There must be 500 unemployed
women in Preston City, and

89
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,210
that's choice A.

90
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,830
OK, problem number four.

91
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,900
And I will switch from
this kind of

92
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,320
nauseating color, I think.

93
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,540
   

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,370
A group of students washed
cars to raise money.

95
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:24,230
The net amount, A, in dollars
raised by washing k cars, is

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,750
given by the function-- oh,
well, they tell us, A of k.

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,310
So this is how much you've made
after washing k cars, is

98
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,580
4k minus 30.

99
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,980
If the group washed 15
cars, what is the

100
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,300
net amount they raised?

101
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, this seems unbelievably
easy, because they tell you

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,800
that k is 15, so A of 15 is
equal to 4 times 15, minus 30.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,000
4 times 15 is 60, minus 30.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,410
That just equals 30.

105
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,200
They raised $30.

106
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,860
That's choice E.

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,560
If I was taking the SAT, I would
have paused, just to

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,060
make sure I didn't
miss something.

109
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,240
I'm actually pausing
now to make sure I

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,950
didn't miss a trick.

111
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,810
But I think that's it.

112
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,250
That's kind of one of those
freebie quick questions.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,802
OK, problem number five.

114
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:22,110
And I'll switch colors
for variety.

115
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:35,650
If xr is equal to v, and v is
equal to kr, and we also know

116
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,010
that rv does not equal 0,
which also tells us that

117
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,560
neither you of these numbers
can equal 0, which of the

118
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,740
following is equal to k?

119
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,710
And all of the choices have
just x's and some numbers.

120
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,016
So we want to write
k in terms of x.

121
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,006
So xr is equal to v, and
v is equal to kr.

122
00:06:55,006 --> 00:07:01,790
   

123
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:09,190
So we know that xr is equal to
kr, and since we know that r

124
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,990
does not equal 0, we can divide
both sides of this

125
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,285
equation by r and
they cancel out.

126
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:20,060
And we get x is equal to
k, or k is equal to x.

127
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,080
So that is choice D.

128
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,690
Well, they're giving us a lot
of quick problems, but I

129
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,150
that's good.

130
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,300
I can fit a lot into
one video.

131
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,550
OK, problem number six.

132
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,000
   

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,780
The eggs in a certain basket
are either white or brown.

134
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,690
If the ratio of white eggs to
brown eggs-- I should probably

135
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,410
do it in those colors, but I'm
not to confuse you-- the ratio

136
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:53,190
of white to brown is
equal to 2 over 3.

137
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,670
Each of the following could be
the number of eggs in the

138
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,440
basket, except-- so this
is a tricky one.

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,150
So the ratio of white to
brown is 2:3, right?

140
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,550
   

141
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,025
White to brown is equal
to 2 over 3.

142
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:18,740
Or another way we could say it
is, white is equal to 2/3

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,790
times the brown eggs.

144
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,590
And so the total eggs in the
basket are going to be white

145
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,840
plus brown.

146
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,590
   

147
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,714
And so we could write, this w,
it as 2/3 of the number of

148
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:38,590
brown eggs is the white eggs--
that's what we figured out

149
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,030
here-- plus the brown eggs.

150
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,720
So the total number of baskets
is-- let's see, what's 2/3

151
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,140
plus-- 1 is the same thing
is 3/3, right?

152
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,680
The total number of baskets
is 5/3 times the

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,930
number of brown eggs.

154
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,730
   

155
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,540
We know we can't have a
fractional number of eggs, so

156
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,065
we know that this has to
be a whole number.

157
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:08,120
   

158
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,420
If we said 5/3B, this is the
first choice is equal to 10,

159
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,290
could that be a choice?

160
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:22,370
Let's see, B would have to be
3/5 times 10, which would be--

161
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,330
this cancels out-- that
works, right?

162
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,270
Because then B would be
6, so that could work.

163
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,200
   

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,250
Well, I think we already
know, right?

165
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,790
The total number of baskets
has to be divisible by 5.

166
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,660
Because B is equal to the total
number times 3 over 5.

167
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,010
I just used this equation, 5/3B
is equal to the total.

168
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,980
Multiply both sides
[? by the ?]

169
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,230
reciprocal, you get this.

170
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,630
And the only choice that's not
divisible by 5 is choice B.

171
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,980
Hope I didn't rush it, but I had
to finish under the wire.

172
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,420
I'll see
