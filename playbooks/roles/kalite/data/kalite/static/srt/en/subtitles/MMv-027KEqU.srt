1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:03,960
We know how to take derivatives of

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,440
functions. If I apply the derivative operator to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,635
X^2, I get 2X.

4
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,630
Now if I also apply the derivative operator to

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,036
X^2+1, I also get 2X.

6
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:23,943
If I apply the derivative operator to X^2

7
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,235
X^2+pi, I also get 2X. The derivative of X^2

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,714
is 2X, the derivative with respect to X of pi of a constant

9
00:00:31,714 --> 00:00:34,249
is just 0. The derivative with respect to X of 1

10
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,281
is just a constant, is just 0.

11
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:39,082
So once again, this is just going to be equal to 2X.

12
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:43,187
In general, the derivative with respect to x of X^2

13
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:47,309
plus any constant, any constant, is going to be

14
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,569
equal to 2X. The derivative of X^2 with respect to X is 2X

15
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:54,838
Derivative of a constant with respect to X, a constant does not change

16
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,277
with respect to X, so it's just equal

17
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:00,901
to 0. So you have, you take the derivative, you apply the derivative operator

18
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,391
to any of these expressions, and you get 2X.

19
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,974
Now let's go the other way around. Let's think about the antiderivative.

20
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:13,254
Anti-derivative. And one way of

21
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:14,782
thinking about it, it's the, it's the,

22
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:18,294
we're doing the opposite of the derivative operator.

23
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,174
The derivative operator, you get an expression,

24
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,785
and you find find this derivative.

25
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:24,861
Now what we want to do, is, given some expression,

26
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:25,810
we want to find

27
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,260
what it could be the derivative of.

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,045
What it could be the derivative of.

29
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,357
So if someone were to tell you,

30
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:33,980
were to give you 2X.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,213
If someone were to say, 2X

32
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:41,132
So if someone were to ask you: what is

33
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:44,901
what is 2X

34
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:49,432
the derivative - derivative -

35
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:53,072
of? They're essentially asking you for

36
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,464
the antiderivative!

37
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:57,302
And so you could say: well, 2X is

38
00:01:57,302 --> 00:01:59,518
the derivative of X^2.

39
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,624
2X is the derivative of X^2.

40
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:05,020
But you could say: 2X is the derivative of X^2 plus 1.

41
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,014
You could also say that 2X is the derivative of X^2 plus pi.

42
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:09,612
I think you get the general idea.

43
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,934
So if you wanted to write it in the most general sense.

44
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:12,991
you would write:

45
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,433
that 2X is the derivative of X^2

46
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:18,301
plus some constant.

47
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,368
So this is what you would consider

48
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:22,511
the antiderivative of 2X.

49
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:25,072
Now that's all nice, but this is kind of

50
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,279
clumsy to have to write the sentence like this

51
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,523
so lets come up with some kind of notation

52
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:30,969
for the antiderivative.

53
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,100
And the convention here is to use

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,412
kind of a strange-looking notation.

55
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:38,012
Is to use a

56
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:40,142
a big, elongated, S-looking thing like that

57
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:43,844
and the dx around the function

58
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,406
you're trying to take the antiderivative

59
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:49,085
of. So in this case, it would look something like this.

60
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:49,844
This is just

61
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,076
saying: this is equal to the antiderivative of 2x.

62
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:56,371
And the antiderivative of 2X, we have already seen,

63
00:02:56,371 --> 00:03:01,304
is X^2, is X^2 plus C.

64
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,216
Now, you might be saying:

65
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,689
Why do we use this type

66
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,170
of crazy notation?

67
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,519
It will become more obvious when we

68
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,901
study the definitive integral, and areas under curves,

69
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,363
and taking sums of

70
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:16,185
rectangles, in order to approximate the area of the curve.

71
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:19,500
Here, it really should just be viewed as a notation for

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,839
antiderivatives.

73
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:24,701
And, this notation right over here,

74
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,160
this whole expression, is called:

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,644
the indefinite integral.

76
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:31,810
The indefinite...indefinite...

77
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,825
indefinite integral of 2X

78
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:37,845
which is another way of just saying:

79
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:40,300
the antiderivative of

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
2X.
