1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,540
The whole point in learning
differential equations is that

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,270
eventually we want to model real
physical systems. I know

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,330
everything we've done so far has
really just been a toolkit

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,390
of being able to solve them, but
the whole reason is that

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,410
because differential equations
can describe a lot of systems,

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,320
and then we can actually
model them that way.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,750
And we know that in the real
world, everything isn't these

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,820
nice continuous functions, so
over the next couple of videos

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,890
we're going to talk about
functions that are a little

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,880
bit more discontinuous than what
you might be used to even

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,460
in kind of a traditional
calculus or traditional

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,880
Precalculus class.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,910
And the first one is the
unit step function.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,790
Let's write it as u, and
then I'll put a little

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,290
subscript c here of t.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,110
And it's defined as when t is--
let me put it this way.

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,150
It's defined as 0 when t is less
than-- whatever subscript

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,220
I put here-- when t
is less than c.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,380
And it's defined as 1-- that's
why we call it the unit step

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,900
function-- when t is greater
than or equal to c.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,700
And if I had to graph this, and
you could graph it as well

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,030
but it's not too difficult
to graph.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,622
Let me draw my x-axis
right here.

25
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,010
And I'll do a little
thicker line.

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,490
That's my x-axis right there.

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,430
This is my y-axis right there.

28
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,990
   

29
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,380
And when we talk about Laplace
transforms, which we'll talk

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,400
about shortly, we only care
about t is greater than 0.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,090
Because we saw, in our
definition of the Laplace

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,510
transform, we're always taking
the integral from 0 to

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,360
infinity, so we're
only dealing with

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,470
the positive x-axis.

35
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,160
But anyway, by this definition,
it would be zero

36
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,970
all the way until you get to
some value c, so you'd be zero

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,400
until you get to c.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,460
And then at c, you jump, and the
point c is included x is

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,220
equal to c here.

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,070
So it's included, so I'll put
a dot there, because it's

41
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,300
greater than or equal to c.

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,040
You're at 1, so this
is 1 right here.

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,790
And then you go forward
for all of time.

44
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,960
And you're like, Sal, you just
said that differential

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,100
equations, we're learning to
model things, why is this type

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,760
of a function useful?

47
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,580
Well, in the real world,
sometimes you do have

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,100
something that essentially jolts
something, that moves it

49
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,790
from this position
to that position.

50
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,450
And obviously, nothing can move
it immediately like this,

51
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,650
but you might have some
system, it could be an

52
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,580
electrical system or mechanical
system, where maybe

53
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,000
the behavior looks something
like this, where maybe it

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,680
moves it like that
or something.

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,090
And this function is a pretty
good analytic approximation

56
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,490
for some type of real world
behavior like this when

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,920
something just gets moved.

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,010
Whenever we solve these
differential equations

59
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,540
analytically, we're really
just trying to get a pure

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,730
model of something.

61
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,610
Eventually, we'll see that it
doesn't perfectly describe

62
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,730
things, but it helps describe
it enough for us to get a

63
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,040
sense of what's going
to happen.

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,820
Sometimes it will completely
describe things, but anyway,

65
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,220
we can ignore that for now, so
let me get rid of these things

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,030
right there.

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,180
So the first question is,
well, you know, what if

68
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,000
something doesn't jar
just like that?

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,500
What if I want to construct more
fancy unit functions or

70
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,270
more fancy step functions?

71
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,470
Let's say I wanted to construct
something that

72
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,350
looked like this.

73
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,940
Let me say this is my y-axis.

74
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,310
This is my x-axis.

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,700
And let's say I wanted to
construct something that is

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,820
at-- and let me do it in
a different color.

77
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,935
Let's say it's at 2
until I get to pi.

78
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:33,450
   

79
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:40,410
And then from pi until forever
it just stays at zero.

80
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,290
So how could I construct this
function right here using my

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,350
unit step function?

82
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,940
So what if I had written
it as-- so my unit step

83
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,630
function's at zero initially, so
what if I make it 2 minus a

84
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,100
unit step function that
starts at pi?

85
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,770
   

86
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,710
So if I define my function
here, will this work?

87
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,250
Well, this unit step function,
when we pass pi, is only going

88
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,970
to be equal to 1, but
we want this thing

89
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,900
to be equal to zero.

90
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,820
So it has to be 2 minus 2, so
I'll have to put at 2 here,

91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,010
and this should work.

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,730
When we're at any value below
pi, when t is less than pi

93
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,970
here, this becomes a zero,
so our function will just

94
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,870
evaluate to 2, which
is right there.

95
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,490
But as soon as we hit t is equal
to pi, that pi is the c

96
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,050
in this example, as soon as
we hit that, the unit step

97
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,150
function becomes 1.

98
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,120
We multiply that by 2, and we
have 2 minus 2, and then we

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,650
end up here with zero,

100
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,810
Now, that might be nice and
everything, but let's say you

101
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,610
wanted for it to go back up.

102
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:03,600
Let's say that instead of it
going like this-- let me kind

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,180
of erase that by overdrawing the
x-axis again-- we want the

104
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,510
function to jump up again.

105
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,860
We want it to jump up again.

106
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,150
And lets say at some value,
let's say it's at 2pi, we want

107
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,210
the function to jump up again.

108
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,920
How could we construct this?

109
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,630
And we could make it jump to
anything, but let's say we

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,410
want it to jump back to 2.

111
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,290
Well, we could just add another
unit step function

112
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,810
here, something that would have
been zero all along, all

113
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,270
the way up until this point.

114
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,160
But then at 2pi, it jumps,
so in this case,

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,475
our c would be 2pi.

116
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:38,670
That's our unit step function,
and we want it to jump to 2.

117
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,430
This would just jump
to 1 by itself.

118
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,070
So let's multiply it by 2.

119
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,480
And now we have this function.

120
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,780
So you could imagine, you
can make an arbitrarily

121
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,180
complicated function of things
jumping up and down to

122
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,260
different levels based on
different essentially linear

123
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,720
combinations of these
unit step functions.

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,090
Now, what if I wanted
to do something

125
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,030
a little bit fancier?

126
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,990
What if I wanted to do something
that-- let's say I

127
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,420
have some function that
looks like this.

128
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,756
Let me draw some function.

129
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,340
I should draw straighter
than that.

130
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,950
I should have some standards.

131
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,860
So let's say that just
my regular f of t--

132
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,740
let me, this is x.

133
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,030
Actually, why am I doing x?

134
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,700
This would be the t-axis.

135
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,940
We're doing the time domain.

136
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,100
It could have been x.

137
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,720
And then we'll call
this f of t.

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,590
So let me draw some
arbitrary f of t.

139
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,160
Let's say my function looks
something crazy like that.

140
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,100
   

141
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,980
So this is my f of t.

142
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,680
What if I'm modeling
a physical system

143
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,910
that doesn't do this?

144
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,260
That actually at some point--
well, actually, let's say it

145
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,330
stays at zero.

146
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,050
It stays at zero until
some value.

147
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,405
Let's say it goes to zero
until-- I don't know, I'll

148
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,190
call that c again.

149
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,870
And then at c, f of t
kind of starts up.

150
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,140
So right at c, f of t should
start up, so it just kind of

151
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,620
goes like this.

152
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,270
So essentially what we have here
is a combination of zero

153
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,860
all the way, and then we
have a shifted f of t.

154
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,600
So at c, we have a shifted f of
t, so it shifts that way.

155
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,960
So how can we construct this
yellow function, where it's

156
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,150
essentially a shifted version
of this green function, but

157
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,960
it's zero below c?

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,020
This green function might
have continued.

159
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,320
It might have gone something
like this.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,325
It might have, continued and
done something crazy, but what

161
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:38,460
we did is we shifted it from
here to there, and then we

162
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,440
zeroed out everything
before c.

163
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,870
So how could we do that?

164
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,880
Well, just shifting this
function, you've learned in

165
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,940
your Algebra II or your
precalculus classes, to shift

166
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,620
a function by c to the right,
you just to replace your t

167
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,970
with a t minus c.

168
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,790
So this function right here
is f of t minus c.

169
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,960
And to make sure I get it right,
what I always do is I

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,270
imagine, OK, what's going to
happen when t is equal to c?

171
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,400
When t is equal to c, you're
going to have a c minus a c,

172
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,030
and you're going
to have f of 0.

173
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,840
So f of 0, it should
be the same.

174
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,270
So when t is equal to c, this
value, the value of the

175
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,560
function should be equivalent
to the value of the original

176
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,850
green function at zero, so it's
equivalent to that value,

177
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,110
which makes sense.

178
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,110
If we go up one more above c, so
let's say this is one more

179
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,650
above c, so we get to this
point, if t is c plus 1, then

180
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,390
when you put c plus 1 minus c,
you just have f of 1, and f of

181
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,970
1 is really just this
point right here.

182
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,650
And so it'll be that f of
1, so it makes sense.

183
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,390
So as we move one forward here,
we're essentially at the

184
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,350
same function value as we were
there, so the shift works.

185
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,320
But I said that we have to
also-- if I just shifted this

186
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,080
function, you would have all
this other stuff, because you

187
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,700
would have had all this other
stuff when the function was

188
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
back here still going on.

189
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,770
The function-- I'll draw it

190
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,810
lightly-- would still continue.

191
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,330
But I said I wanted to zero
out this function

192
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,390
before we reach c.

193
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,800
So how can I zero out
that function?

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,950
Well, I think it's pretty
obvious to you.

195
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,750
I started this video talking
about the unit step function.

196
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,680
So what if I multiply
the unit step

197
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,280
function times this thing?

198
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,990
What's going to happen?

199
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,870
So what if I-- my new function,
I call it the unit

200
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:35,130
step function up until c of
t times f of t minus c?

201
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,210
So what's going to happen?

202
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,300
Until we get to c, the unit
step function is zero when

203
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,250
it's less than c.

204
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,700
So you're going to have zero
times I don't care what this

205
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,070
is Zero times anything is zero,
so this function is

206
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,260
going to be zero.

207
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,900
Once you hit c, the unit step
function becomes 1.

208
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,710
So once you pass c, this thing
becomes a 1, and you're just

209
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,320
left with 1 times
your function.

210
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,520
So then your function can behave
as it would like to

211
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,450
behave, and you actually
shifted it.

212
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,410
This t minus c is what actually
shifted this green

213
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,210
function over to the right.

214
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,760
And this is actually
going to be a very

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,630
useful constructed function.

216
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,110
And in a second, wer'e going
to figure out the Laplace

217
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,820
transform of this, and you're
going to appreciate, I think,

218
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,220
why this is a useful function
to look at.

219
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,800
But now you understand at least
what it is and why it

220
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
essentially shifts a function
and zeroes out everything

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,520
before that point.

222
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,140
Well, I told you that this is
a useful function, so we

223
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,480
should add its Laplace transform
to our library of

224
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,720
Laplace transforms.
So let's do that.

225
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,410
Let's take a the Laplace
transform of this, of the unit

226
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,670
step function up to c.

227
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,840
I'm doing it in fairly general
terms. In the next video,

228
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,200
we'll do a bunch of examples
where we can apply this, but

229
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
we should at least prove to
ourselves what the Laplace

230
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,000
transform of this thing is.

231
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Well, the Laplace transform of
anything, or our definition of

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,260
it so far, is the integral from
0 to infinity of e to the

233
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,630
minus st times our function.

234
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,240
So our function in this case is
the unit step function, u

235
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,950
sub c of t times f
of t minus c dt.

236
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,530
And this seems very general.

237
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,670
It seems very hard to evaluate
this integral at first, but

238
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,540
maybe we can make some form of
a substitution to get it into

239
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,860
a term that we can appreciate.

240
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,940
So let's make a substitution
here.

241
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,690
Let me pick a nice variable
to work with.

242
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,370
I don't know, we're not
using an x anywhere.

243
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,440
We might as well use an x.

244
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,980
That's the most fun variable
to work with.

245
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,325
Sometimes, you'll see in a
lot of math classes, they

246
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:53,060
introduce these crazy Latin
alphabets, and that by itself

247
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,660
makes it hard to understand.

248
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,510
So I like to stay away from
those crazy Latin alphabets,

249
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,180
so we'll just use a regular x.

250
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,120
Let's make a substitute.

251
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,790
Let's say that x is equal
to t minus c.

252
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,560
Or you could, if we added t to
both sides, we could say that

253
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,700
t is equal to x plus c.

254
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,600
Let's see what happens
to our subsitution.

255
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,220
And also, if we took the
derivative of both sides of

256
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,360
this, or I guess the
differential, you would get dx

257
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,965
is equal to dt.

258
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:27,460
Or I mean, if you took dx with
respect to dt, you would get

259
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,040
that to equal to 1. c
is just a constant.

260
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,900
Then if you multiply both sides
by dt, you get dx is

261
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,700
equal to dt, and that's
a nice substitution.

262
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,610
So what is our integral going
to become with this

263
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,100
substitution?

264
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,670
So our integral this
was t equals 0 to

265
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,520
t is equal to infinity.

266
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:51,880
When t is equal to 0, what is
x going to be equal to?

267
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,080
Well, x is going to be
equal to minus c.

268
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,170
Actually, before I go there,
let me actually take a step

269
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,350
back, because we
could progress.

270
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,720
We could go in this direction.

271
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,150
But we could actually simplify
it more before we do that.

272
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,680
Let's go back to out original
integral before we even made

273
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,010
our substitution.

274
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,680
If we're taking the integral
from 0 to infinity of this

275
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,290
thing, we already said what does
this integral look like

276
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,750
or what does this function
look like?

277
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
It's zero.

278
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,870
We have this unit step function
sitting right here.

279
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:29,650
We have the unit step function
sitting right there.

280
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,980
So this whole expression
is going to be zero

281
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
until we get to c.

282
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,220
This whole thing, by definition,
this unit step

283
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,400
function is zero until
we get to c.

284
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
So this everything's going
to be zeroed out

285
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,940
until we get to c.

286
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,890
So we could essentially say,
you know, we don't have to

287
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,010
take the integral from t equals
0 to t equals infinity.

288
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,540
We could take the integral--
let me write it here.

289
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,450
I'll just use that old
integral sign.

290
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,070
We could just take the integral
from t is equal to c

291
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:05,790
to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st, the unit step

292
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:12,280
function, uc of t times
f of t minus c dt.

293
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,990
In fact, at this point, this
unit step function, it has no

294
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,280
use anymore.

295
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,210
Because before t is equal to c,
it's 0, and now that we're

296
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:26,090
only worried about values above
c, it's equal to 1, so

297
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,440
it equals 1 in this context.

298
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,240
I want to make that
very clear to you.

299
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
What did I do just here?

300
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,340
I changed our bottom boundary
from 0 to c.

301
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,550
And I think you might realize
why I did it when I was

302
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,270
working with the substitution,
because this will simplify

303
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,090
things if we do this
ahead of time.

304
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,550
So if we have this unit step
function, this thing is going

305
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,960
to zero out this entire integral
before we get to c.

306
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,950
Remember, this definite integral
is really just the

307
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,060
area under this curve of this
whole function, of the unit

308
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,980
step function times
all of this stuff.

309
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,200
All of this stuff, when we
multiply it, is going to be

310
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,050
zero until we get
to some value c.

311
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,620
And then above c, it's going to
be e to the minus st times

312
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,760
f of t minus c.

313
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,820
So it's going to start doing
all this crazy stuff.

314
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,610
So if we want to essentially
find the area under this

315
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,840
curve, we can ignore all the
stuff that happens before c.

316
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,520
So instead of going from t
equals 0 to infinity, we can

317
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,640
go from t is equal to c to
infinity because there was no

318
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,540
area before t was equal to c.

319
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,960
So that's all I did here.

320
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,920
And then the other thing I said
is that the unit step

321
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,640
function, it's going to be 1
over this entire range of

322
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,420
potential t-values, so we can
just kind of ignore it.

323
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,370
It's just going to be 1 this
entire time, so our integral

324
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,380
simplifies to the definite
integral from t is equal to c

325
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,440
to t is equal to infinity of e
to the minus st times f of t

326
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,025
minus is c dt.

327
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,030
And this will simplify
it a good bit.

328
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,600
I was going down the other
road when I did the

329
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,830
substitution first, which would
have worked, but I think

330
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,750
the argument as to why I could
have changed the boundaries

331
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,760
would've been a harder
argument to make.

332
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,900
So now that we had this, let's
go back and make that

333
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,760
substitution that x is
equal to t minus c.

334
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,340
So our integral becomes-- I'll
do it in green-- when t is

335
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,990
equal to c, what is x?

336
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,950
Then x is 0, right?

337
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,440
c minus c is 0.

338
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,680
When t is equal to infinity,
what is x?

339
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,720
Well x is, you know, infinity
minus any constant is still

340
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,460
going to be infinity, or if
the limit is t approaches

341
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,920
infinity, x is still going
to be infinity here.

342
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,100
And it's the integral of e to
the minus s, but now instead

343
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,245
of a t, we have the
substitution.

344
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:42,530
If we said x is equal to t minus
c, then we can just add

345
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,660
c to both sides and get t
is equal to x plus c.

346
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:53,830
So you get x plus c there, and
then times the function f of t

347
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,230
minus c, but we said t minus
c is the same thing as x.

348
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,370
And dt is the same
thing is dx.

349
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,460
I showed you that right there,
so we can write this as dx.

350
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,700
Now this is starting to look
a little bit interesting.

351
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,780
So what is this equal to?

352
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,730
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity-- let me

353
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:23,579
expand this out-- of e to
the minus sx minus sc

354
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,240
times f of x dx.

355
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,360
Now, what is the equal to?

356
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,500
Well, we could factor out an e
to the minus sc and bring it

357
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
outside of the integral, because
this has nothing to do

358
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,150
with what we're taking the
integral with respect to.

359
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,970
So let's do that.

360
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,530
Let me take this guy out, and
maybe just to not confuse you,

361
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,600
let me rewrite the
whole thing.

362
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,650
0 to infinity.

363
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,010
I could rewrite this e term
as e-- actually, let me

364
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,460
write it this way.

365
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,930
I'll do what was already in
green as e to the minus sx

366
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,820
times e to the minus sc.

367
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,860
Common base.

368
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,800
So if I were to multiply these
two, I could just add the

369
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,430
exponents, which you would
get that up there, times

370
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,580
f of x, d of x.

371
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,200
This is a constant term with
respect to x, so we can just

372
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,720
factor it out.

373
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,350
We can just factor this thing
out right there, so then you

374
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,290
get e to the minus sc times
the integral from 0 to

375
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:37,810
infinity of e to the minus
sx times f of x dx.

376
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,090
Now, what were we doing
here the whole time?

377
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:49,070
We were taking the Laplace
transform of the unit step

378
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,950
function that goes up to c, and
then it's 0 up to c, and

379
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,000
it's 1 after that, of t times
some shifted function

380
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,680
f of t minus c.

381
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,720
And now we got that as being
equal to this thing, and we

382
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,710
made a substitution.

383
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,490
We simplified it a little bit.

384
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,610
e to the minus sc times the
integral from 0 to infinity of

385
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,600
e to the minus sx f of x dx.

386
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,180
Something about the tablet
doesn't work properly right

387
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,290
around this period.

388
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,920
But this should look
interesting to you.

389
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,600
What is this?

390
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,470
This is the Laplace transform
of f of x.

391
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,280
Let me write that down.

392
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,610
What's the Laplace transform
of-- well, I could write it as

393
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,640
f of t or f of x.

394
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,910
The Laplace transform of f of
t is equal to the integral

395
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:55,680
from 0 to infinity of e to the
minus st times f of t dt.

396
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,040
This and this are the
exact same thing.

397
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,520
We're just using a t here.

398
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
We're using an x here.

399
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,790
No difference.

400
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,910
They're just letters.

401
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,490
This is f of t.

402
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,870
e to the minus st
times f of t dt.

403
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,270
I could have also rewritten
it as the Laplace

404
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,970
transform of f of t.

405
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,790
I could write this as the
integral from 0 to infinity of

406
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:24,470
e to the minus sy
times f of y dy.

407
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,930
I could do it by anything
because this

408
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:26,740
is a definite integral.

409
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,330
The y's are going to disappear,

410
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,190
and we've seen that.

411
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,500
All you're left with
is a function of s.

412
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,910
This ends up being some capital,
well, you know, we

413
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,140
could write some capital
function of s.

414
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,060
So this is interesting.

415
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,680
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t times some scaling

416
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,060
factor, and that's what
we set out to show.

417
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:54,790
So we can now show that the
Laplace transform of the unit

418
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:02,700
step function times some
function t minus c is equal to

419
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,870
this function right here, e to
the minus sc, where this c is

420
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,650
the same as this c right
here, times the Laplace

421
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,740
transform of f of t.

422
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,370
Times the Laplace transform--
I don't know what's going on

423
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,450
with the tablet right
there-- of f of t.

424
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,100
Let me write that.

425
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,450
This is equal to-- because it's
looking funny there-- e

426
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:32,540
to the minus sc times the
Laplace transform of f of t.

427
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,865
So this is our result.

428
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:37,660
   

429
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,740
Now, what does this mean?

430
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,290
Oh, look it back-filled
it somehow.

431
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,180
What does this mean?

432
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,285
What can we do with this?

433
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:50,420
Well, let's say we wanted to
figure out the Laplace

434
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,910
transform of the unit
step function that

435
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,200
starts up at pi of t.

436
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,430
And let's say we're taking
something that we know well:

437
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:05,510
sine of t minus pi.

438
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,570
So we shifted it, right?

439
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,750
This thing is really
malfunctioning at this point

440
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,450
right here.

441
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,600
Let me pause it.

442
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,440
I just paused.

443
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,890
Sorry if that was a little
disconcerting.

444
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,420
I just paused the video because
it was having trouble

445
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,950
recording at some point
on my little board.

446
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,130
So let me rewrite the result
that we proved just now.

447
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,430
We showed that the Laplace
transform of the unit step

448
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,520
function t, and it goes to 1
at some value c times some

449
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,820
function that's shifted
by c to the right.

450
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,770
It's equal to e to the minus cs
times the Laplace transform

451
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,520
of just the unshifted
function.

452
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,400
That was our result.

453
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,630
That was the big takeaway
from this video.

454
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,550
And if this seems like some
Byzantine, hard-to-understand

455
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,630
result, we can apply it.

456
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,930
So let's say the Laplace
transform, this is what I was

457
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:01,080
doing right before the actual
pen tablet started

458
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,920
malfunctioning.

459
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,500
If we want to take the Laplace
transform of the unit step

460
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,610
function that goes to 1 at pi,
t times the sine function

461
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,220
shifted by pi to the right, we
know that this is going to be

462
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,320
equal to e to the minus cs.

463
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,700
c is pi in this case, so minus
pi s times the Laplace

464
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,760
transform of the unshifted
function.

465
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,030
So in this case, it's
the Laplace

466
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,300
transform of sine of t.

467
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,460
And we know what the Laplace
transform of sine of t is.

468
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,250
It's just 1 over s
squared plus 1.

469
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,770
So the Laplace transform of this
thing here, which before

470
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,720
this video seemed like something
crazy, we now know

471
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,090
is this times this.

472
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,380
So it's e to the minus pi s
times this, or we could just

473
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,900
write it as e to the minus pi
s over s squared plus 1.

474
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,990
We'll do a couple more examples
of this in the next

475
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,900
video, where we go back and
forth between the Laplace

476
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,950
world and the t and between
the s domain

477
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,810
and the time domain.

478
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,730
And I'll show you how this is a
very useful result to take a

479
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:13,910
lot of Laplace transforms and
to invert a lot of Laplace

480
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,160
transforms.
