1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,440
I tend to do a lot of videos
with simplified examples and

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,690
round numbers.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,120
But let's get a little bit of
dose of reality and actually

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,600
analyze a real transaction
that happened.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,010
Just to show to you that some of
these CDOs are selling for

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,760
well below what the people paid
for them, or what that

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,980
they were listed as
on the books.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,080
And even the price is actually,
probably, even worth

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,940
less than what the person
actually paid.

11
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,540
Let's just analyze this and then
I'll let you make your

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,720
own conclusions.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,220
So this was a press release.

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,550
This is part of the press
release that Merrill Lynch

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,390
sent out on July 28.

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
And just remember, they had
just finished reporting

17
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,700
earnings, right?

18
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,100
As of June 30.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,980
That's when they do a snapshot
of their books.

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,650
So keep that in the
back of your mind.

21
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,060
Right?

22
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,830
It says on July 28, Merrill
Lynch agreed to sell $30.6

23
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,250
billion gross notional amount of
U.S. super senior ABS CDOs

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,920
to an affiliate of
Lone Star Funds.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,630
So this is important.

26
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,640
So the $30.6 billion,
what is that?

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,810
That's the number that either
Merrill Lynch originally paid

28
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,780
for it, or the amount
that they originally

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,230
valued those CDOs are.

30
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,870
So $30.6 billion gross
notional-- notional, I have a

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,950
notion it's worth this--
notional amount

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,360
of U.S. super senior.

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,660
That sounds safe.

34
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,370
Super senior, ABS-- that's
short for asset back

35
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,200
security-- CDOs-- we know
a lot about CDOs now,

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,580
collateralized and obligations--
to an affiliate

37
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,650
of Lone Star Funds.

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,260
So this is a Texas private
equity firm.

39
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,090
I'll underlined them in green,
because I think they know what

40
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,510
they're doing.

41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,680
For purchase price
of $6.7 billion.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,540
So just off that first line,
just very superficial, before

43
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,950
we do any other real analysis,
notice that, at one time,

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,670
there was an asset that someone
had a notion was worth

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,410
$30.6 billion.

46
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,190
And now they sell to
this private equity

47
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,220
firm for $6.7 billion.

48
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,280
So what's the recovery
on that asset?

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,070
Just superficially?

50
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,160
And we're going to dig in a
little bit and realize that

51
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,330
recovery is even worse
than that.

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,850
They're able to sell for $6.7
something that they originally

53
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,520
thought was worth $30.6.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,190
So that's $0.22 on the dollar.

55
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,040
So this, at least what that
first sentence implies, it is

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,260
$0.22 on the dollar.

57
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,560
At least relative to the
original amount that the those

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
assets were booked at.

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,330
At the end of the second
quarter of 2008.

60
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,730
Notice, the end of the second
quarter of 2008 was four weeks

61
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,120
ago relative to this
press release.

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,320
That's June 30, four
weeks ago.

63
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Not like can happen
in four weeks.

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,220
At the end of the second quarter
of 2008, these CDOs

65
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,470
were carried at $11.1 billion.

66
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,940
So this is interesting.

67
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,050
So Merrill Lynch, at one point,
probably last year, had

68
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,020
these assets on their balance
sheets for $30.6 billion.

69
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,640
They, too, realized that they
were stinky assets.

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,510
And they said, well, we have
to, just to be somewhat

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,480
genuine, we have to write down
these assets a little bit.

72
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,120
And notice, they don't want to
write them down too much,

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,860
because if they write them down
too much no one else is

74
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,320
going to want to invest
in Merill Lynch.

75
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Or maybe they'll say Merrill
Lynch might not even have

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
anything left.

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,230
But at some point, they said,
you know what, we will be

78
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,680
pseudo honest with the market.

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,110
And these things that were worth
$30.6 billion, we're

80
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,690
going to write them down
to a $11.1 billion.

81
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,740
So they must have taken-- if
they did that in one period, I

82
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,880
don't know how many periods it
took them to realize that this

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,200
$30.6 billion asset was really
worth $11.1-- but in those

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,890
periods, they would have had
to take a-- what is that?

85
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,060
A $29.5 billion write down.

86
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,490
Right?

87
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,680
And they did that to look pseudo
honest that the asset

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,670
it is worth $11 billion.

89
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,030
But they valued it
at $11 billion.

90
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,050
And then four weeks later, they
sell it for $6.7 billion.

91
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,520
So whatever was on their books
on-- as far as this asset is

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,060
concerned-- whatever was on
their books on July 1, or on

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,030
June 30, what are they getting
recovery relative to that?

94
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:13,000
They're getting $6.7 billion for
something that just four

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,260
weeks ago, not a lot can
happen in four weeks.

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,519
Woops.

97
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,230
$11.1 and then I can
delete that.

98
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,800
So they got $0.60 on the dollar
relative to what was on

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,690
their books as of June 30.

100
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,170
Right?

101
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,640
So It's a $0.60 recovery
relative to what they thought

102
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,170
it was worth only
four weeks ago.

103
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,990
And then they say, in connection
with this sale,

104
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,310
Merrill Lynch will record
a write-down.

105
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,940
Essentially, now we
sold this thing.

106
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,010
So now we have to essentially
come to terms with reality.

107
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,750
And so they recorded
a write-down of

108
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,500
$4.4 billion pretax.

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,210
And what's $4.4?

110
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,930
That's the difference between
what they thought it was

111
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,620
worth, between the $11.1 billion
and what it ended up

112
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,710
being worth, or $6.7 billion.

113
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,980
   

114
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,590
What's interesting here
is that's not the

115
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,290
end of the bad news.

116
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,370
You might think that's
bad enough.

117
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,090
They were only able to get
$0.22 on the dollar for

118
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,400
something that they originally
valued at $30.6, or what four

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,170
weeks ago they valued at
$11.1 billion, right?

120
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,600
And I don't think they got
a lot more information.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,770
I think they just put that $11.1
billion down on June 30

122
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,850
just because it was probably
a convenient number.

123
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,260
Enough of a write-down to make
it look like you're writing

124
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,940
things down.

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,500
But not so much of
a write-down to

126
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,350
scare people too much.

127
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,820
But this is the interesting
part.

128
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,960
I mean this paragraph talks
little bit about the exposure,

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,200
and we can get into that.

130
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,960
But if I talked about that, I
could talk another 20 minutes.

131
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,450
But let's get to this last
paragraph that was buried in

132
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,160
the press release.

133
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,330
And this is really the
crux of things.

134
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,260
And this, I think, will give you
a clue of the shell games

135
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,790
that the financial industry
tries to play on people.

136
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,060
Merrill Lynch will provide
financing to the purchaser for

137
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,180
approximately 75% of
the purchase price.

138
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,260
So Lone Star Funds, they're
buying it for $6.7 billion,

139
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,840
but 75% of that is a loan
from Merrill Lynch.

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,120
So how much are they lending?

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,630
6.7 times 0.75.

142
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,030
They're lending them
roughly $5 billion.

143
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,430
Right?

144
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,690
So Merrill Lynch is lending $5
billion-- I don't like that

145
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,190
color-- $5 billion.

146
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,030
So Lone Star says these things
are so stinky, we're only

147
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,280
going to pay $6.7 billion
for them.

148
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,820
And in fact, they're even
stinkier than that.

149
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,330
In order for me to buy them, I
don't even want to buy them

150
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,110
with my money.

151
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,950
You're going to have to lend
me most of the money to buy

152
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,890
that asset.

153
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,970
And even this wouldn't be so
bad if you just lent it

154
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,300
generally to Lone Star.

155
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,240
And if one day Lone Star, if
these assets were worth

156
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,050
nothing, you could still go
after Lone Star's other

157
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,760
assets, right?

158
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,530
If you could just go after Lone
Star generally, maybe

159
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,050
this loan isn't such a crazy
thing because maybe Lone Star

160
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,830
has a lot of assets.

161
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,240
I don't know.

162
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,010
But I suspect that they're
fairly large

163
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,080
private equity firm.

164
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,260
This is just insult to
injury right here.

165
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,410
You got to give credit to
those Lone Star guys.

166
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,790
The recourse on this loan-- the
recourse is essentially

167
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,490
what you can go after if the
person decides that they don't

168
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,440
feel like paying that loan-- the
recourse on this loan will

169
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,290
be limited to the assets
of the purchaser.

170
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,830
   

171
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,420
The purchaser will not own any
assets other than those sold

172
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,220
pursuant to this transaction.

173
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,390
So essentially, what Lone Star
did, because Lone Star does

174
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,420
own assets other than
essentially this asset that

175
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,130
it's buying right now.

176
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,930
I'm guessing it does.

177
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,430
That it's a real private
equity firm.

178
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,790
What they probably did is, they
created a corporation

179
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,080
that does not own anything
else, right?

180
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,460
So that if they default,
nothing's left.

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,620
So they created a corporation,
they capitalize that

182
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,400
corporation, with whatever,
$1.7 billion.

183
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,970
So essentially Lone star puts
$1.7 billion into the Lone

184
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,250
Star Funds, or whatever.

185
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,230
An affiliate-- the affiliate
is probably the corporation

186
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,690
that they created.

187
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,400
So this affiliate is created
by Lone Star.

188
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,820
Lone Star puts in $1.7
billion into it.

189
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,070
Merrill Lynch lends this
affiliate $5 billion.

190
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,750
And then this affiliate buys,
or Merrill Lynch is able to

191
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,490
off load this $6.7 billion
on to that affiliate.

192
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,460
And this is a special purpose
entity if I've

193
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,070
ever heard of one.

194
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,450
Because it's purpose is very
special-- essentially for

195
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,610
Merrill Lynch to take something
off of it's books,

196
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,960
and not have to write
it down all the way.

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,340
Think about what happens.

198
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,650
Let's say that these
assets are worth 0.

199
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,660
Let's just say that they're
completely worthless.

200
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,340
In the previous video I
showed you why that

201
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,880
could be the case.

202
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,280
What's the loss to Lone Star?

203
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,580
Well Lone Star, they
don't have to pay

204
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,590
the 5 billion back.

205
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,700
We just said the purchaser will
not own any assets other

206
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,730
than those sold pursuant
to this transaction.

207
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,780
And that the recourse is only
those assets, right?

208
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,010
So if they don't pay that loan
back, Merrill Lynch, all they

209
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,290
can do is take back those
worthless assets.

210
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,710
And then what's going
to happen?

211
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,500
Well then Lone Star is just
going to lose $1.7 billion.

212
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,860
Or even better, what
if those assets are

213
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,710
only worth $1.7 billion?

214
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,540
Right?

215
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,560
Let's think about
that example.

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's say those assets are
worth $1.7 billion.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,250
And Lone Star says, you know we
don't feel like paying back

218
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,570
this $5 billion loan.

219
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,640
What's going to happen?

220
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,930
Merrill Lynch is going to
just take back those

221
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,270
$1.7 billion of assets.

222
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,370
So what's Lone Star's downside?
$1.7 billion.

223
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,800
So essentially, what are
they paying for it?

224
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,430
They're essentially paying $1.7
billion, and they're kind

225
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,610
of sharing the upside in
between $1.7 and $5.

226
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,910
So really, if you think that
they're paying $1.7 or even a

227
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,150
little bit more, what is Lone
Star putting at risk? $1.7.

228
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:58,280
So $1.7 billion divided by--
what was the original notional

229
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,080
value of this asset?-- So
they're paying $0.06 on the

230
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,470
original notional value.

231
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,880
And what are they paying
relative to what Merrill Lynch

232
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,250
told its shareholders this asset
was worth four weeks

233
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,390
before this press release?

234
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,490
They're paying $0.15 on the
dollar relative to that.

235
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,980
Well anyway, this is a
real world example.

236
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,180
This was not made up by me, and
frankly I don't think I

237
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,740
could have made up something
this outlandish.

238
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,630
But it hopefully gives you an
idea of what is actually going

239
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,530
on in the real world.
