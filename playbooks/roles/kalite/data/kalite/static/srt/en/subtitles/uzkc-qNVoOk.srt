00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:07,306
What I want to do in this video is give you
at least a basic overview of 'probability' –

2
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,656
a word that you've probably heard a lot.

3
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,448
And you are probably a little bit familiar with it.

4
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:14,574
But, hopefully, this will give you 
a little deeper understanding.

5
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:19,719
So let's say that I have a fair coin over here

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,684
And so, when I talk about a fair coin, I mean

7
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:25,968
that it has an equal chance of 
landing on one side or another.

8
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,879
So you can maybe view it as the sides are equal –

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,832
their weight is the same on either side.

10
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:35,468
If I flip it in the air, it's not more likely 
to land on one side or the other.

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,960
It's equally likely.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,011
So you have one side of this coin –

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,328
(So this would be the heads, I guess.

14
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:45,706
I'm trying to draw George Washington.
I'll assume it's a quarter of some kind.)

15
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:48,362
And then on the other side, of course, is the tails.

16
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:52,462
So that is heads.
The other side right over there is tails.

17
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,182
So, if I were to ask you, 
"What is the probability –

18
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:58,810
I'm going to flip a coin.

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,325
And I want to know, "What is 
the probability of getting heads?"

20
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,733
And I could write that like this:

21
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:07,103
WRITING: The probability of getting heads.

22
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,366
And you probably, just based on that question, 
have a sense of what probability is asking.

23
00:01:11,366 --> 00:01:20,175
It's asking for some type of way of getting your 
hands around an event that's fundamentally random.

24
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:22,337
We don't know whether it's heads or tails.

25
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:27,051
But we can start to describe 
the chances of it being heads or tails.

26
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,946
And we'll talk about different
ways of describing that.

27
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:34,534
So, one way to think about it – (And this is the way
that probability tends to be introduced in textbooks.)

28
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:40,195
– is you say, "Well, look. How many different 
equally likely possibilities are there?"

29
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,008
"So how many equally likely possibilities?"

30
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:56,532
So, number of equally – (Let me write 'equally.')
– of equally likely possibilities.

31
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:59,332
And of the number of equally likely possibilities,

32
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:04,524
I care about the number that 
contain my event right here.

33
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:19,489
So, the number of possibilities that meet 
my constraint – that meet my conditions.

34
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,512
So, in the case of the probability 
of figuring out heads,

35
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:25,704
what is the number of 
equally likely possibilities?

36
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:27,344
Well, there are only two possibilities.

37
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:31,479
We're assuming that the coin can't land 
on its edge and remain standing straight up.

38
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,754
We're assuming it lands flat.

39
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,629
So, there are two possibilities here – 
two equally likely possibilities.

40
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:40,442
You could either get heads,
or you could get tails.

41
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:43,651
And what number of possibilities
meet my conditions?

42
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,479
Well, there's only one: the condition of 'heads.'

43
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,438
So, it'll be 1 over 2.

44
00:02:49,438 --> 00:02:53,329
So, one way to think about is that 
the probability of getting heads

45
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:56,837
is equal to 1 over 2 –
is equal to one-half (1/2).

46
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:59,069
If I wanted to write that as a percentage,

47
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,457
we know that 1/2 is the same thing as 50%.

48
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:07,597
Now, another way to think about – 
or conceptualize – probability,

49
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,402
that will give you this exact same answer, is to say,

50
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:15,069
"Well, if I were to run the 
experiment of flipping a coin,"

51
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,391
So, this flip, you view this as an "experiment".

52
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,829
I know this isn't the kind of 
experiment that you're used to.

53
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:25,003
Normally, you think of an experiment as doing 
something in chemistry or physics, or all the rest.

54
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:29,268
But an experiment is every time 
you run this random event.

55
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:35,201
So one way to think about probability is, "if I were to do this experiment, many, many, many times,

56
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,772
if I were to do it a thousand times, 
or a million times,

57
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:41,412
or a billion times, or a trillion times –
(And the more, the better.)

58
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,449
– what percentage of those would give me the outcome I care about?

59
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,293
What percentage of those would give me heads?

60
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:52,040
And so, another way to think about this
50% probability of getting heads is

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,277
if I were to run the experiment tons of times,

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:59,626
if I were to run this experiment forever –
an infinite number of times,

63
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:03,373
what percentage of those would be heads?
You would get this 50%.

64
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:06,091
And you can run that simulation. 
You can flip a coin.

65
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:08,629
(And it's actually a fun thing to do.
I encourage you to do it.

66
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:13,314
if you take 100 or 200 quarters or pennies, 
and you stick them in a big box,

67
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:18,204
and shake the box, so you are kind of 
simultaneously flipping all the coins,

68
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,402
and then count how many of 
those are going to be heads,

69
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:24,976
you're going to see that the larger 
the number of coins that you are doing,

70
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:28,003
the more likely you are going to get 
something really close to 50%.

71
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:31,645
But there's always some chance that 
even if you flipped a coin a million times –

72
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:35,137
there's some super-duper small 
chance that you get all tails.

73
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:43,602
But the more you do, the more likely that things are
going to trend toward 50% of them being heads.

74
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,735
Now, lets just apply these same ideas.

75
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:49,601
And while we're starting with probability –
at least the basics –

76
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,146
this is probably an easier
thing to conceptualize.

77
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,003
But a lot of times, this is 
actually a helpful one too:

78
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,390
this idea that if you run the
experiment many, many times,

79
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,524
what percentage of those trials are going
to give you what you were asking for?

80
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:03,351
– in this case, heads.

81
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:06,918
Now let's do another very typical example 
when you first learn probability.

82
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,090
And this is the idea of rolling a die.

83
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,401
So here's my die, right over here.

84
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:17,337
And, of course, you have 
the different sides of the die.

85
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:23,002
So that's the 1. And that's the 2. 
And that's the 3, etc. And what I want to do –

86
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:29,734
And we know of course that there are – (assuming a fair die) six equally likely possibilities.

87
00:05:29,734 --> 00:05:35,202
When you roll this, you could get 
a 1, a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, or a 6.

88
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,537
And they are all equally likely.

89
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,977
So if I were to ask you,

90
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:45,292
"What is the probability, 
given that I'm rolling a fair die" –

91
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:50,928
(So the experiment is rolling this fair die.) 
"What is the probability of getting a 1?"

92
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:54,522
Well, what are the number of 
equally likely possibilities?

93
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,595
Well, I have six equally likely possibilities.

94
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:00,191
And how many of those meet my conditions?

95
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,392
Well, only 1 of them meet my conditions – 
that right there.

96
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:07,671
So, there is a 1/6 probability of rolling a 1.

97
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:16,803
What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 6?

98
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:23,671
Well, once again, there are six equally 
likely possibilities that I can get.

99
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:26,602
And now there are now two possibilities 
that meet my condition:

100
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:31,735
I could roll a 1, OR I could roll a 6.

101
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:37,646
So, now there are two possibilities
that meet my constraints (my conditions).

102
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:42,647
So there is a 1/3 probability
of rolling a 1 or a 6.

103
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:46,091
Now, what is the probability –

104
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,658
And this might seem a little silly 
to even ask this question.

105
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,561
But I'll ask it just to make it clear.

106
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:53,708
What is the probability of rolling 
a 2 and a 3 –

107
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,855
And I'm just talking about 
on one roll of the die.

108
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:01,803
Well, in any roll of the die,
I can only get a 2 or a 3.

109
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,813
I'm not talking about taking
two rolls of this die.

110
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:14,804
So in this situation, there are 6 possibilities,
but none of these possibilities are a 2 AND a 3.

111
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:22,815
On one trial, you can't get a 2
and a 3 in the same experiment.

112
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:29,068
Getting a 2 and a 3 are mutually exclusive events.
They cannot happen at the same time.

113
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:31,870
So the probability of this is actually 0.

114
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,781
There's no way to roll this normal die,
and all of a sudden you get a 2 AND a 3.

115
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:40,680
And I don't want to confuse you with that, 
because it's abstract and impossible.

116
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,108
So let's cross this out right over here.

117
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:50,011
Now, what is the probability
of getting an even number?

118
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:54,968
So, once again, I have 6 equally likely
possibilities when I roll that die.

119
00:07:54,968 --> 00:08:01,479
And which of these possibilities
meet my condition – the condition of being even?

120
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,065
Well, 2 is even. 4 is even. And 6 is even.

121
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:11,327
So three of the possibilities meet my
conditions – meet my constraints.

122
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:13,395
So this is 1/2.

123
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:17,395
If I roll a die, I have a 1/2 chance
of getting an even number.
