00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,500
Problem 33

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,610
Asks: What distance did Jane travel?

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,100
What distance did she travel?

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,190
So, one. Bill traveled 40 miles in 40 minutes,

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,830
or essentially a mile a minute,

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,500
which is 60 miles an hour, whatever, 1 mile a minute, right?

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,740
That's what we can figure out. 1 mile per minute.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,740
That has no information about how far did Jane travel.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,020
It's useless.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,000
Two. Jane traveled at the same average rate as Bill.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,830
So that tells that Jane,

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,050
also, if she went at the same average rate as Bill,

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,710
that means that she also went 1 mile per minute.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,780
But we're not asking for how fast did Jane travel

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,140
or what was her average rate.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,470
We're asking for how far did she travel?

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,240
So with statements one and two combined,

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,140
all we know is Jane's rate,

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,940
but we don't know how long she traveled for.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,770
So we don't know the distance.

21
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,040
So the answer is e,

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,910
that both statements together are not sufficient.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,870
If statement two told us that Jane traveled at the same rate

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,320
as Bill and she traveled at that rate for 10 minutes,

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,560
then we would be able to solve this problem.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,910
But it didn't, so even with both pieces of information,

27
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,780
we still don't know how far Jane traveled,

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,030
only how fast she traveled.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,230
34.

30
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,070
What number is 15% of x?

31
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:42,000
So what we want to know is 0.15x.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,650
That's what we're trying to solve for.

33
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:55,050
Statement one tells us, 18 is 6% of x.

34
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,650
So you normally wouldn't even have to solve for it.

35
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,170
All you know is, by looking at this statement,

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,930
you can solve for x.

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,610
And if you can solve for x,

38
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,800
then you can just multiply that times 0.15,

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,990
and you'll have the answer to the original statement.

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,820
So you immediately know that statement one is sufficient.

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,190
If you don't believe me,

42
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,030
you can just write this as a equation 18 is equal to 6% of x.

43
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,300
And then you just solve for x.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,360
So 18 divided by 0.06, and then multiply it times 0.15,

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,030
and you've got your answer.

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Two, or Statement number two. 2/3 of x is 200.

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,080
Once again, you look at this,

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,530
and you say, this is a simple equation.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,250
I could solve for x here.

50
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,180
If I solve for x here, then I just substitute it back here,

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,410
and I will know what 15% of x is, and I would be done.

52
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,000
So each of these statements individually are sufficient

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,750
to answer our question what is 15% of x.

54
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,630
I don't think I've got to go through

55
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,120
the exercise of actually solving for that,

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,040
because I think you understand what I'm talking about.

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
35.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,850
Oh, I like these.

59
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:17,110
So they say 3.2 rectangle triangle, or delta, 6.

60
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,840
And they say, if rectangle and delta, or triangle,

61
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,700
each represent single digits in the decimal above.

62
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,920
OK. So this is a decimal. I thought they might be operations.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,730
So this is a decimal.

64
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,040
So it's four digits behind the decimal spot.

65
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,630
What does rectangle represent?

66
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,090
So we want to know what does this decimal--

67
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,040
what's the digit right here?

68
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,430
Statement number one tells us,

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,730
when the decimal is rounded to the nearest tenth,

70
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,680
3.2 is the result.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,010
The nearest tenth.

72
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,990
So when you round, what you do is you look at--

73
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,100
if we're rounding to the nearest tenth,

74
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,150
we look at this number, right?

75
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,350
We look at the rectangle.

76
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,690
And if the rectangle is 5 or greater,

77
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,760
we would round up, so we would get to 3.3.

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,000
If the rectangle is less than 5,then we would round down to 2

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,610
So statement number one tells us that rectangle is less than 5

80
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,440
And we know it's greater than or equal to 0,

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,000
because it's a digit.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,760
It's 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, right?

83
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,040
So we can say it's 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,050
That's rectangle.

85
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,450
But that by itself does not allow to figure out

86
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,000
what rectangle is.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,790
Now statement number two tells us,

88
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,280
when the decimal is rounded to the nearest hundredth,

89
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,590
3.24 is the result.

90
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,000
3.24 is the result when you round to the nearest hundredth.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,030
OK. So this is interesting.

92
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,670
Ok. So this number here is either going to be--

93
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,230
so when you're rounding to something,

94
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,920
it's either going to be either rounding down or rounding up.

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:10,340
So this tells us--so this number right here can either be 3--

96
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,010
so we already know, it can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

97
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,980
But which of these numbersŁż

98
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,050
when you round them could be rounded up or down to 4

99
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:28,780
Well, this could be 2, 3, 5, right?

100
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,220
Let me give you one scenario.

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:39,360
We could have 3.2356, where this is the rectangle

102
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,390
and this is triangle.

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,060
So this would round to 3.24.

104
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:52,630
You could also have 3.2416.

105
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,000
where this is the rectangle and this is the triangle.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,510
And either of these would round to 3.24.

107
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,960
So this tells us essentially that the rectangle

108
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,070
has to be either 3 or 4.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,330
And this tells us that it's either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

110
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,530
But even when you use them individually,

111
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,380
they don't tell you exactly what the rectangle is.

112
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,660
And when you use them together,

113
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,230
you can just narrow down to 3 or 4,

114
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,030
which just statement two alone tells you.

115
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,600
So this actually turns out that when you use both

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,650
statements together, you still can't get the answer.

117
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,390
You'd either need a third term there,

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,190
or we would have to have a little bit more information

119
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,470
about what the triangle is.

120
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,640
If they told us that the triangle rounds you up

121
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,440
or is greater than 5 or less than 5 or something like that,

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,030
then we could figure out what the rectangle is.

123
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,340
So they answer here is E, if I haven't missed something.

124
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,530
That together,

125
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,050
both statements are not sufficient to answer the question.

126
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,040
36.

127
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,930
A profit from the sale of a certain appliance increases,

128
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,690
though not proportionally with the number of units sold.

129
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,430
So it's not-- you know,

130
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,010
the profits do not equal just some constant times units.

131
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,140
It equals maybe some constant times units squared

132
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,090
or something like that.

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Did the profit exceed 4 million on sales of 380,000 units?

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,310
So is profit greater than 4 million--

135
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:41,000
this one is interesting-- when units is equal to 380,000?

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,010
Let's see if we can figure this out.

137
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,800
So they say that the profit exceeds

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,440
2 million on sales of 200,000.

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,220
So statement one says profit is greater than 2 million

140
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,670
when units is equal to 200,000.

141
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,510
Now, if they told us that profit was proportional to units,

142
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,550
then we could say,

143
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,930
oh, well, if we increase the units from 200,000 to 380,000,

144
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,850
then we're not doubling the units.

145
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,660
So then we can't be-- well, it still would be ambiguous

146
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,420
because they're not saying profit equals 2.

147
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,140
They're saying that profit is greater than 2,

148
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,010
so this actually still doesn't give me a lot of information.

149
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,500
Statement number two.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,010
I'll do it in a different color.

151
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,370
Statement number two says

152
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:45,020
the profit exceeds 5 million on sales of 350,000 units.

153
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,030
OK. So this is interesting.

154
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,200
So this tells us that when units are 350,000,

155
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,530
our profit is already greater than 5 million,

156
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,030
so they're definitely greater than 4 million.

157
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,390
And notice, they told us that

158
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,900
the profit from the sale of an appliance increases,

159
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,480
but not proportionally, with the number of units sold.

160
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,490
So if we made more than 5 million when there are 350,000 units

161
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,180
we know that when you go from 350,000 to 380,000,

162
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,200
we know from the statement of the problem

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,000
that the profit has to increase.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,440
We don't know by how much, but it's going to increase.

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,130
So the profit was already greater than 5 million.

166
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,420
It's going to increase above 5 million.

167
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,030
So statement two tells us that

168
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,990
the profit is definitely going to be above 5 million,

169
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,020
so it's definitely going to be above 4 million.

170
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,030
So statement two alone is enough.

171
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,130
And statement one actually tells us very little information

172
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,120
because we don't know how does the profit change

173
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,270
as you incrementally add units.

174
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,350
Maybe every other unit--

175
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,010
maybe every unit above 200,000 that you add, you get,

176
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,590
a millionth of a penny.

177
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,790
And then it doesn't tell you anything.

178
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,470
Or maybe you get a million pennies.

179
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,040
So it's very hard to tell.

180
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,360
Problem number-- actually, I'm already at 10 minutes.

181
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,790
Let me do that in the next video.

182
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,080
See you soon.
