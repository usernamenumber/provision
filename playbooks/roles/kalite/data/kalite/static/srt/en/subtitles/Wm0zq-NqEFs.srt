1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:03,470
Let's add 536 to 398,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,803
and we're going to do it two different ways so you really understand what this carrying is all about.

3
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:09,467
So first, we'll do it in the more traditional way.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:12,403
We start in the "one"s place, we say "what's 6 plus 8?"

5
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:18,534
Well, we know that 6 plus 8 is equal to 14.

6
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:21,367
And so when we write it down here in the sum....

7
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:25,805
We could say... well look, the 4 is in the "ones" place. So it's equal to 4, plus one 10.

8
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:28,337
So let's write that one "10" in the "tens" place.

9
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,410
And now we focus on the "tens" place.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,035
We have one 10, plus three 10s, plus nine 10s... So, what's that going to get us?

11
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:45,201
1 plus 3 plus 9 is equal to 13.

12
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:49,937
Now we have to remind ourselves that this is thirteen 10s.

13
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:59,670
Or another way of thinking about it, this is three 10s and one hundred.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,616
You might say, "Wait Wait! How does this make sense?"

15
00:01:01,616 --> 00:01:06,701
Remember! This is in the 10s place, so we're adding a one 10, plus three 10s, plus nine 10s.

16
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:14,137
So we're actually adding 10 plus 30 plus 90, and we're getting 130.

17
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:19,137
And so we're putting the 30 (the 3 in the 10s place represents the "30").

18
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:26,452
So this is the 3 that represents the 30, and then we're placing this 1 in the 100s place.

19
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:29,534
Ten 10s is equal to 100.

20
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:32,001
And now we're adding up the 100s place.

21
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:40,468
1 plus 5 plus 3 is equal to...

22
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:45,201
Let's see... 1 plus 5 is equal to 6, plus 3 is equal to 9.

23
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:48,952
We have to remind ourselves: this is nine hundred. This is in the hundreds place.

24
00:01:48,952 --> 00:02:09,951
So this is actually one hundred (let me make the colors the same), so this is actually one hundred, plus five hundred, plus three hundred...

25
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:16,367
is equal to nine hundred. And that's exactly what we got here.

26
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:22,737
One hundred, plus five hundred, plus three hundred, is equal to nine hundred. And we're done.

27
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:26,000
This is equal to 934.
