00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:05,769
We're at the Museum of Modern Art, looking at a really wonderful painting.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:08,088
This is by Henri Matisse, this is The Piano Lesson

3
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:10,571
and it dates to 1916.

4
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:13,009
It's a big, austere canvas.

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:22,640
It's probably one of Matisse's most Picasso-like canvases, sort of cubist in its severity and its use of line.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,657
And some art historians have seen it as Matisse really trying to, in a sense, answer cubism.

7
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:36,490
It certainly doesn't have the sensuality of many Matisse paintings, what we usually think of when we think of Matisse.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,087
As explicitly, you're absolutely right. None of the sensuous hips or...

9
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:49,953
There are little hints of it with the arabesques of the wrought iron, which is of course the balustrade,

10
00:00:49,953 --> 00:01:01,188
but that's perfect because some art historians actually see the rendering of that balustrade actually as a kind of written expression of the music that's being produced by Pierre Matisse,

11
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:06,835
Matisse's son, who's at the piano.

12
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,186
And so Pierre Matisse is at the piano, this is 1916...

13
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:15,185
Pierre Matisse, by the way, grew up to be a really important gallery owner in New York, selling his father's work, among others.

14
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:19,717
And we have a sense of real balance in this painting

15
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:24,316
because, you had mentioned the lack of sensuality, but actually if you look in the lower left corner --

16
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:25,867
that female figure on the lower left --

17
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:28,785
It's not a real female figure, or I shouldn't say "real,"

18
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:33,193
No, a Matisse sculpture, it's a painting of a bronze sculpture by Matisse.

19
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:43,216
So there we have a nude and she is curvilinear and really sensuous, and really contrasted, almost as if they were boxers, from the figure in the upper right.

20
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:50,904
Yes, she looks very strict, and reminds me of the metronome that's directly under her,

21
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:59,489
and is kind of uprightness and strictness and a sense of discipline and order in that figure.

22
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,132
She does hover over Pierre Matisse's head in a kind of menacing way, doesn't she?

23
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:12,122
And she's painted, you're right, so rectilinear, she's clothed, so much in opposition to the sculpture on the other side.

24
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:16,900
And the metronome is in that other corner, you're absolutely right, and that kind of alternates between the two.

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:26,826
So, soome art historians have suggested that this is a painting that is really about this opposition between order and structure, and beauty.

26
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:29,993
Sensuality and discipline, I can see that.

27
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:37,825
Now what about his face, do you think? Why one eye? Why is his face so cubist?

28
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:41,544
I have no idea. But it actually seems to reflect the metronome, doesn't it?

29
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:48,051
It does, and somehow I think it speaks to me of removing this image from reality.

30
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:56,416
So this is Matisse really trying to impose some of the strict geometric formal aspects in the painting to the figure itself,

31
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,541
so that we're not seeing it as a literal rendering.

32
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:03,137
I think so. And that figure in the upper right, is that really a figure there?

33
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:05,167
No, because this is his house in Issy, that's a wall,

34
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:12,084
and in fact the woman that we're seeing in a sense playing the role of the piano teacher is actually a painting of a woman on a high stool.

35
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:14,519
It's also in the collection at the Museum of Modern Art.

36
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,071
So it's really not...it's an allegory. It sort of is what it seems, but it is not what it seems.

37
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:23,521
Well, Matisse is playing with levels of reality here, right? He often does that.

38
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:27,837
Pierre looks out at us as though he would like to somehow escape

39
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:32,757
into the pleasures of the female nude on the far left!

40
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:36,408
Maybe, or perhaps of the shaft of...the daylight outside.

41
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:42,521
You almost see the last rays of sunlight coming across the lawn in that wonderful triangle between the windows.

42
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,788
It's a pretty austere allegory about what it means to make art.

43
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:52,874
In some ways I look at Pierre and I see him as a sort of stand-in for Henri, for Matisse himself.

44
00:03:52,874 --> 00:04:03,643
