PROBLEM: "Write a mathematical expression which

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,686
corresponds to x time y minus a times b times c."

3
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:13,398
So let's just think this through: "x times y."

4
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:14,545
Well I could write that –

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:16,844
I could either write that as x × y,

6
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:19,314
or I could just write that as xy.

7
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:22,227
And from that, I'm going to subtract a times b times c.

8
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,996
So: minus a times ...

9
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:27,827
And I could write it a [asterisk] b [asterisk] c.

10
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,876
I could write it like that.

11
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:32,493
Or I could just write -abc.

12
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,252
And you can see how it's being interpreted

13
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,602
by the computer right over here.

14
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,435
It understands that I'm saying

15
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:40,264
x times y minus a times b times c (or xy - abc).

16
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:42,408
And I'm done.
