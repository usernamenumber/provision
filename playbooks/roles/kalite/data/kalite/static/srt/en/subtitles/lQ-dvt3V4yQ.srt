1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:08,200
Let's do one more example dealing with displacement, velocity and time. So we have: If Marcia travels

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:18,042
for 1 minute at 5 m/s to the south, how much will she be displaced? And so we know, we know that

3
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:26,867
that velocity (let me do it this way) we know that velocity is equal to displacement

4
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:33,733
is equal to displacement divided by time, it's really once again, it is change in time

5
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,733
but we'll just say time, that's implicitly change in time

6
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:38,533
and if you manipulate this a little bit

7
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,733
you really just multiply both sides by time

8
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,267
you just multiply both sides by the variable 't'

9
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,533
you get displacement, cuz this cancels out...

10
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,712
...you get displacement, and I'll flip this around

11
00:00:50,712 --> 00:00:55,410
I'll write...what's on the righthand side I'll write on the left

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,955
so you get displacement is equal to time times velocity

13
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:01,045
or velocity times time

14
00:01:01,045 --> 00:01:08,615
is equal to velocity times time or velocity times change in time

15
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,400
so over here they're asking for displacement

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,800
they're asking us how much did Marcia get displaced

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,533
and they're saying that she travels for one minute

18
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:19,118
so this one minute right over here, this is her time

19
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,467
sometimes you can do that as her change in time

20
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,035
it really is her change in time

21
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:27,417
whatever...you know...if it said 0 minutes on her stopwatch when she started

22
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,831
at the end it'll say 1 minute

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,400
or if it starts at 5 minutes, or maybe it was 3:05 when she started, it'll be 3:06 when she finish

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,067
it was really the change in time

25
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,867
once again, I won't write the delta there, just cuz

26
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:40,929
it keeps it...this is the way you most frequently see it

27
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,748
but I want to tell you that these are the same thing for the purpose of this problem

28
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:47,000
because sometimes you'll see the delta there

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,733
so the one minute, the 't' right over here is one minute...

30
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,894
...one minute...

31
00:01:53,894 --> 00:02:00,133
...at 5 meters per second to the south

32
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,733
this right over here is the velocity

33
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,993
they give us the magnitude, which is 5 meters per second

34
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,710
or you could say that's the speed

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,877
and they also give us the direction, to the south

36
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,452
so this right over here

37
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:19,994
is 5 meters per second to the south

38
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:22,800
so we might just say, hey if we want displacement

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,067
that's just going to be equal to

40
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:40,467
5 meters per second to the south times 1 minute

41
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,467
the problem here is, when we talk about displacement

42
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,467
we're going to think about a magnitude of how much its moved

43
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:49,668
so it'll be a distance of some kind, and some direction

44
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:52,990
we have our direction here, but we don't want any other units there

45
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,677
and if we just multiply this over here

46
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:57,749
we have a minute over here, but we have seconds in the denominator

47
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,667
you can't just cancel out a minute and a second

48
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,671
so you can't just say you're going to get 5, and have some weird thing here

49
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,333
so in order for it to all work out

50
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:09,267
you either have to convert the 5 meters per second to meters per minute

51
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:11,267
or let me phrase it in another way

52
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,933
you have to convert the 5 meters per second to some amount of meters per minute

53
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,067
not 5 meters per minute, it's going to be different

54
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,692
or you convert the 1 minute to seconds

55
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:23,733
so at least in my mind it's easier to convert 1 minute to seconds

56
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,391
so let's do that

57
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,775
so this is the same thing

58
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,041
1 minute times...

59
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,667
and we want to get rid of the minute, the minute is essentially the numerator right now

60
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,000
we can put this over one

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but it's essentially the numerator

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,477
so we want to divide by minutes

63
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:41,258
and we want to multiply by seconds

64
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:43,533
we want seconds in the numerator

65
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,862
and so what is...how many seconds are there per minute?

66
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:50,846
you have 60 seconds for every 1 minute

67
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:53,329
and so you have a minute canceling out with the minutes

68
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:57,256
and so now you have 5 meters per second to the south times 60 seconds

69
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:00,533
this is now cool, cuz you now have seconds and seconds

70
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,241
I wrote 'sec' there, but this is also 'sec'

71
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:08,200
so now you have seconds over seconds, those cancel out

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:18,200
so your displacement is going to be equal to 5 times 60

73
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
and then your units left are meters

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,333
all the time units have canceled out

75
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:31,302
and it's meters to the south

76
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:41,456
and this is equal to...5 times 60 is 300 meters to the south

77
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:45,211
and we are done, that's how much she has been displaced

78
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:51,800
if they just wanted the distance, you can say that she traveled 300 meters

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,446
just that part, the magnitude of the displacement...

80
00:04:54,446 --> 99:59:59,999
...that is the distance that she traveled
