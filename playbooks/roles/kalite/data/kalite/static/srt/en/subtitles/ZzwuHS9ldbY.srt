1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,876
Let's learn a little
bit about springs.

3
00:00:02,876 --> 00:00:05,100
So let's say I have a spring.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,870
Let me draw the ground so that
we know what's going on with

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,490
the spring.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,280
So let me see, this
is the floor.

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,830
That's the floor, and
I have a spring.

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,680
It's along the floor.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll use a thicker one, just
to show it's a spring.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,060
Let's say the spring looks
something like this.

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,170
Whoops, I'm still using
the line tool.

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,430
So the spring looks like this.

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,299
This is my spring, my amazingly
drawn spring.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,170
Let's say at this end it's
attached to a wall.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,980
That's a wall.

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,470
And so this is a spring when I
don't have any force acting on

17
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,880
it, this is just the natural
state of the spring.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,050
And we could call this, where it
just naturally rests, this

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,340
tip of the spring.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,640
And let's say that when I were
to apply a force of 5 Newtons

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,410
into the spring, it looks
something like this.

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,210
Redraw everything.

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:11,355
So when I apply a force of 5
Newtons-- I'll draw the wall

24
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:12,700
in magenta now.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,180
   

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,300
When I apply a force
of 5 Newtons, the

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,550
spring looks like this.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,510
   

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,880
It compresses, right?

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,060
We're all familiar with this.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,320
We sit on a bed every
day or a sofa.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,620
So let's say it compresses
to here.

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,220
   

34
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,960
If this was the normal resting--
so this is where the

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
spring was when I applied no
force, but when I applied 5

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,420
Newtons in that direction, let's
say that this distance

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:01,290
right here is 10 meters.

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,940
And so a typical question that
you'll see, and we'll explain

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,759
how to do it, is a spring
compresses or elongates when

40
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,950
you apply a certain force
by some distance.

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,010
How much will it compress when
you apply a different force?

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,615
So my question is how much will
it compress when I apply

43
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:19,260
a 10-Newton force?

44
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,480
So your intuition that it'll
compress more is correct, but

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,220
is it linear to how much
I compress it?

46
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,150
Is it a square of how
much I compress it?

47
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,175
How does it relate?

48
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,480
I think you probably
could guess.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,880
It's actually worth
an experiment.

50
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,280
Or you could just keep
watching the video.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,020
So let's say I apply
a 10-Newton force.

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,180
What will the spring
look like?

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,740
Well, it'll be more
compressed.

54
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,900
   

55
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,780
Drop my force to 10 Newtons.

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,060
And if this was the natural
place where the spring would

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,580
rest, what is this distance?

58
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,280
Well, it turns out that
it is linear.

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,590
What do I mean by linear?

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,860
Well, it means that the more
the force-- it's equally

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,750
proportional to how much the
spring will compress.

62
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,060
And it actually works
the other way.

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,040
If you applied 5 Newtons in this
direction, to the right,

64
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,670
you would have gone 10 meters
in this direction.

65
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,940
So it goes whether you're
elongating the spring or

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,450
compressing the spring within
some reasonable tolerance.

67
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,620
We've all had this experience.

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,300
If you compress something too
much or you stretch it too

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,070
much, it doesn't really go back
to where it was before.

70
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,430
But within some reasonable
tolerance, it's proportional.

71
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,830
So what does that mean?

72
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:43,990
That means that the restoring
force of the spring is minus

73
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,840
some number, times the
displacement of the spring.

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
So what does this mean?

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,110
So in this example right here,
what was the displacement of

76
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,140
the spring?

77
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,528
Well, if we take positive x to
the right and negative x to

78
00:03:56,528 --> 00:04:00,980
the left, the displacement
of the spring was what?

79
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,010
The displacement, in this
example right here, x is equal

80
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,090
to minus 10, right?

81
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,180
Because I went 10 to the left.

82
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,520
And so it says that the
restorative force is going to

83
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:21,310
be equal to minus K times
how much it's

84
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,260
distorted times minus 10.

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,470
So the minuses cancel out,
so it equals 10K.

86
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,420
What's the restorative force
in this example?

87
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,210
Well, you might say, it's 5
Newtons, just because that's

88
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,550
the only force I've drawn here,
and you would be to some

89
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,160
degree correct.

90
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,260
And actually, since we're doing
positive and negative,

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,570
and this 5 Newton is to the
left, so to the negative

92
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,770
x-direction, actually, I should
call this minus 5

93
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,090
Newtons and I should call this
minus 10 Newtons, because

94
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,340
obviously, these are vectors and
we're going to the left.

95
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,630
I picked the convention that
to the left means negative.

96
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,980
So what's the restorative
force?

97
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,820
Well, in this example-- and we
assume that K is a positive

98
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,500
number for our purposes.

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,370
In this example, the restorative
force is a

100
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,660
positive number.

101
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,310
So what is the restorative
force?

102
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,970
So that's actually the force,
the counteracting force, of

103
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,030
the spring.

104
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,680
That's what this formula
gives us.

105
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,220
So if this spring is stationary
when I apply this

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,030
5-Newton force, that means that
there must be another

107
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,830
equal and opposite force that's

108
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,160
positive 5 Newtons, right?

109
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,460
If there weren't, the spring
would keep compressing.

110
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,240
And if the force was more than 5
Newtons, the spring would go

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,620
back this way.

112
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,010
So the fact that I know that
when I apply a 5-Newton force

113
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,920
to the left, or a negative
5-Newton force, the spring is

114
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,130
no longer moving, it means that
there must be-- or no

115
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,830
longer accelerating, actually,
it means that there must be an

116
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,330
equal and opposite force to
the right, and that's the

117
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,650
restorative force.

118
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,370
Another way to think about it is
if I were to let-- well, I

119
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,510
won't go in there now.

120
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,990
So in this case, the restorative
force is 5

121
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,950
Newtons, so we can
solve for K.

122
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,940
We could say 5 is
equal to 10K.

123
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,110
Divide both sides by 10.

124
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,380
You get K is equal to 1/2.

125
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,850
   

126
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,610
So now we can use that
information to figure out what

127
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,750
is the displacement
when I apply a

128
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,050
negative 10-Newton force?

129
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,410
When I push the spring
in with 10 Newtons in

130
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,790
the leftward direction?

131
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,050
So first of all, what's the
restorative force here?

132
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,790
Well, if the spring is no longer
accelerating in either

133
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,710
direction, or the tip of
the spring is no longer

134
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,120
accelerating in either
direction, we know that the

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,540
restorative force must be
counterbalancing this force

136
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,290
that I'm compressing
with, right?

137
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,810
The force that the spring wants
to expand back with is

138
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,030
10 Newtons, positive
10 Newtons, right?

139
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,550
And we know the spring constant,
this K for this

140
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,780
spring, for this material,
whatever it might be, is 1/2.

141
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,320
So we know the restorative force
is equal to 1/2 times

142
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,280
the distance, right?

143
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,940
And the formula is
minus K, right?

144
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,670
And then, what is
the restorative

145
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,340
force in this example?

146
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,190
Well I said it's 10 Newtons, so
we know that 10 Newtons is

147
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,440
equal to minus 1/2x.

148
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,950
   

149
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,750
And so what is x?

150
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,030
Well, multiply both sides
by minus 1/2, and

151
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,920
you get minus 20.

152
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,455
I'm sorry, multiply both sides
by minus 2, you get minus 20

153
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:19,705
is equal to x.

154
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,900
   

155
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
So x goes to the
left 20 units.

156
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,390
So that's all that
it's telling us.

157
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,710
And this law is called Hooke's
Law, and it's named after--

158
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,810
I'll read it-- a physicist in
the 17th century, a British

159
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,170
physicist. And he figured out
that the amount of force

160
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,460
necessary to keep a spring
compressed is proportional to

161
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,420
how much you've compressed it.

162
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,570
And that's all that
this formula says.

163
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,150
And that negative number,
remember, this formula gives

164
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,710
us the restorative force.

165
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,910
So it says that the force is
always in the opposite

166
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,860
direction of how much
you displace it.

167
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,470
So, for example, if you were
to displace this spring in

168
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,590
this direction, if you were to
apply a force and x were a

169
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,620
positive and you were to go in
that direction, the force-- no

170
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,150
wait, sorry.

171
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,320
This is where the
spring rests.

172
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,260
If you were to apply some force
and take the spring out

173
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,610
to here, this negative number
tells us that the spring will

174
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,610
essentially try to pull back
with the restorative force in

175
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,190
the other direction.

176
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,750
Let's do one more problem
and I think this

177
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,570
will be clear to you.

178
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,460
So let's say I have a spring,
and all of these problems kind

179
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,090
of go along.

180
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:40,280
So let's say when I apply a
force of 2 Newtons, so this is

181
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,880
what I apply when I apply
a force of 2 Newtons.

182
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,180
Well, let's say it this way.

183
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,740
Let's say when I stretch
the spring.

184
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,650
Let's say this is the spring,
and when I apply a force of 2

185
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:05,940
Newtons to the right, the spring
gets stretched 1 meter.

186
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,280
So first of all, let's
figure out what K is.

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,030
So if the spring is stretched
by 1 meter, out here, its

188
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,650
restorative force will be 2
Newtons back this way, right?

189
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,620
So its restorative force, this
2 Newtons, will equal minus K

190
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,530
times how much I displaced it.

191
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,050
Well I, displaced it by 1 meter,
so then we multiply

192
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,380
both sides by negative 1, and we
get K is equal to minus 2.

193
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,350
So then we can use Hooke's Law
to note the equation for

194
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,450
this-- to figure out the
restorative force for this

195
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,110
particular spring, and
it would be minus 2x.

196
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,530
And then I said, well, how much
force would I have to

197
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,730
apply to distort the
spring by 2 meters?

198
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,420
Well, it's 2 times
2, it would be 4.

199
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,330
4 Newtons to displace it by 2
meters, and, of course, the

200
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,580
restorative force will then be
in the opposite direction, and

201
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,620
that's where we get the
negative number.

202
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,800
Anyway, I've run out of time.

203
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,860
I'll see you in the
next video.

204
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:04,900
