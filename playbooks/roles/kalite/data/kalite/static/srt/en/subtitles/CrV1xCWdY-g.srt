1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,670
Let's say I had the set of
vectors-- I don't want to do

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,039
it that thick.

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,350
Let's say one of the vectors is
the vector 2, 3, and then

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:20,910
the other vector is
the vector 4, 6.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,050
And I just want to answer the
question: what is the span of

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,685
these vectors?

8
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:26,800
And let's assume that these
are position vectors.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,330
What are all of the
vectors that these

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,150
two vectors can represent?

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, if you just look at it,
and remember, the span is just

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,150
all of the vectors that can
be represented by linear

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,320
combinations of these.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,470
So it's the set of all the
vectors that if I have some

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,350
constant times 2 times that
vector plus some other

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,490
constant times this vector,
it's all the possibilities

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:52,970
that I can represent when I just
put a bunch of different

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,640
real numbers for c1 and c2.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
Now, the first thing you might
realize is that, look, this

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,250
vector 2, this is just
the same thing as

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,880
2 times this vector.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,000
So I could just rewrite
it like this.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,330
I could just rewrite it as c1
times the vector 2, 3 plus c2

24
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,820
times the vector-- and here,
instead of writing the vector

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,720
4, 6, I'm going to write 2 times
the vector 2, 3, because

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,310
this vector is just a multiple
of that vector.

27
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,330
So I could write c2 times
2 times 2, 3.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,470
I think you see that this is
equivalent to the 4, 6.

29
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,440
2 times 2 is 4.

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,100
2 times 3 is 6.

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,850
Well, then we can simplify
this a little bit.

32
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:45,320
We can rewrite this as just c1
plus 2c2, all of that, times

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,610
2, 3, times our vector 2, 3.

34
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,530
And this is just some
arbitrary constant.

35
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,290
It's some arbitrary constant
plus 2 times some other

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,740
arbitrary constant.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,550
So we can just call this c3
times my vector 2, 3.

38
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,110
So in this situation, even
though we started with two

39
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,040
vectors, and I said, well, you
know, the span of these two

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,419
vectors is equal to all of
the vectors that can be

41
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,260
constructed with some linear
combination of these, any

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,180
linear combination of these,
if I just use this

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,890
substitution right here, can
be reduced to just a scalar

44
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,860
multiple of my first vector.

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,420
And I could have gone the
other way around.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,840
I could have substituted this
vector as being 1/2 times

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,460
this, and just made any
combination of scalar multiple

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,290
of the second vector.

49
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,910
But the fact is, that instead
of talking about linear

50
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,150
combinations of two vectors,
I can reduce this to just a

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,840
scalar combination
of one vector.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,130
And we've seen in R2 a scalar
combination of one vector,

53
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,990
especially if they're
position vectors.

54
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,780
For example, this vector 2, 3.

55
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,850
It's 2, 3.

56
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,440
It looks like this.

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,060
All the scalar combinations of
that vector are just going to

58
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,970
lie along this line.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,740
So 2, 3, it's going
to be right there.

60
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,280
They're all just going to lie
along that line right there,

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,480
so along this line going in
both directions forever.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,000
And if I take negative
values of 2, 3, I'm

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,260
going to go down here.

64
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,695
If I take positive values,
I'm going to go here.

65
00:03:06,695 --> 00:03:08,100
If I get really large positive
values, it's

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,480
going to go up here.

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,640
But I can just represent the
vectors, and when you put them

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,190
in standard form, their arrows
essentially would

69
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,180
trace out this line.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,430
So you could say that the span
of my set of vectors-- let me

71
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,680
put it over here.

72
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:30,200
   

73
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,510
The span of the set of vectors
2, 3 and 4, 6 is

74
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,960
just this line here.

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,930
Even though we have
two vectors,

76
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,990
they're essentially collinear.

77
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,160
They're multiples
of each other.

78
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,970
I mean, if this is 2, 3, 4,
6 is just this right here.

79
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,530
It's just that longer
one right there.

80
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,090
They're collinear.

81
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,340
These two things
are collinear.

82
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,330
   

83
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,500
Now, in this case, when we have
two collinear vectors in

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,380
R2, essentially their span just
reduces to that line.

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,220
You can't represent
some vector like--

86
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,720
let me do a new color.

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,260
You can't represent this vector
right there with some

88
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,890
combination of those
two vectors.

89
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,540
There's no way to kind of
break out of this line.

90
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,890
So there's no way that you can
represent everything in R2.

91
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,330
So the span is just
that line there.

92
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,310
Now, a related idea to this,
and notice, you had two

93
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,650
vectors, but it kind of reduced
to one vector when you

94
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,670
took its linear combinations.

95
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,460
The related idea here is that we
call this set-- we call it

96
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,650
linearly dependent.

97
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,330
Let me write that down:
linearly dependent.

98
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,000
This is a linearly
dependent set.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,350
And linearly dependent just
means that one of the vectors

100
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,040
in the set can be represented
by some combination of the

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,850
other vectors in the set.

102
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,980
A way to think about it is
whichever vector you pick that

103
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,450
can be represented by the
others, it's not adding any

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,520
new directionality or any
new information, right?

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,160
In this case, we already had
a vector that went in this

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,270
direction, and when you throw
this 4, 6 on there, you're

107
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,030
going in the same direction,
just scaled up.

108
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,740
So it's not giving us any new
dimension, letting us break

109
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,050
out of this line, right?

110
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,990
And you can imagine in three
space, if you have one vector

111
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,790
that looks like this and another
vector that looks like

112
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,110
this, two vectors that aren't
collinear, they're going to

113
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,410
define a kind of two-dimensional
space.

114
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,380
They can define a
two-dimensional space.

115
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,840
Let's say that this is
the plane defined

116
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,450
by those two vectors.

117
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,270
In order to define R3, a third
vector in that set can't be

118
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,140
coplanar with those
two, right?

119
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,070
If this third vector is coplanar
with these, it's not

120
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,050
adding any more directionality.

121
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,980
So this set of three
vectors will

122
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,690
also be linearly dependent.

123
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,620
And another way to think about
it is that these two purple

124
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,230
vectors span this plane, span
the plane that they define,

125
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,610
essentially, right?

126
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:07,500
Anything in this plane going in
any direction can be-- any

127
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,410
vector in this plane, when we
say span it, that means that

128
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,620
any vector can be represented
by a linear combination of

129
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,810
this vector and this vector,
which means that if this

130
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,960
vector is on that plane, it can
be represented as a linear

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,390
combination of that vector
and that vector.

132
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,720
So this green vector I added
isn't going to add anything to

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,680
the span of our set of vectors
and that's because this is a

134
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,160
linearly dependent set.

135
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,880
This one can be represented by a
sum of that one and that one

136
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,620
because this one and this
one span this plane.

137
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,190
In order for the span of these
three vectors to kind of get

138
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,170
more dimensionality or start
representing R3, the third

139
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,090
vector will have to break
out of that plane.

140
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,590
It would have to break
out of that plane.

141
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,020
And if a vector is breaking out
of that plane, that means

142
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,370
it's a vector that can't be
represented anywhere on that

143
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,310
plane, so it's outside of the
span of those two vectors.

144
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,400
Where it's outside, it can't
be represented by a linear

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,360
combination of this
one and this one.

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,190
So if you had a vector of this
one, this one, and this one,

147
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,250
and just those three, none of
these other things that I

148
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,980
drew, that would be linearly
independent.

149
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,950
Let me draw a couple more
examples for you.

150
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,430
That one might have been
a little too abstract.

151
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:36,110
So, for example, if I have the
vectors 2, 3 and I have the

152
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:46,330
vector 7, 2, and I have the
vector 9, 5, and I were to ask

153
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,010
you, are these linearly
dependent or independent?

154
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,470
So at first you say, well, you
know, it's not trivial.

155
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,020
Let's see, this isn't a scalar
multiple of that.

156
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
That doesn't look like a scalar
multiple of either of

157
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,800
the other two.

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,320
Maybe they're linearly
independent.

159
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,610
But then, if you kind of inspect
them, you kind of see

160
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,600
that v, if we call this v1,
vector 1, plus vector 2, if we

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,810
call this vector 2, is
equal to vector 3.

162
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,910
So vector 3 is a linear
combination of

163
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,250
these other two vectors.

164
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:25,180
So this is a linearly
dependent set.

165
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,770
And if we were to show it, draw
it in kind of two space,

166
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,010
and it's just a general idea
that-- well, let me see.

167
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,330
Let me draw it in R2.

168
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,409
There's a general idea that if
you have three two-dimensional

169
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,350
vectors, one of them is
going to be redundant.

170
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,070
Well, one of them definitely
will be redundant.

171
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:49,030
For example, if we do 2, 3, if
we do the vector 2, 3, that's

172
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,872
the first one right there.

173
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,730
I draw it in the standard
position.

174
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:06,010
And I draw the vector 7, 2 right
there, I could show you

175
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:13,090
that any point in R2 can be
represented by some linear

176
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,450
combination of these
two vectors.

177
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,570
We can even do a kind of a
graphical representation.

178
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,750
I've done that in the previous
video, so I could write that

179
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:30,630
the span of v1 and v2
is equal to R2.

180
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,100
That means that every vector,
every position here can be

181
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,530
represented by some linear
combination of these two guys.

182
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:49,830
Now, the vector 9,
5, it is in R2.

183
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,730
It is in R2, right?

184
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,060
Clearly.

185
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,490
I just graphed it
on this plane.

186
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,870
It's in our two-dimensional,
real number space.

187
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,100
Or I guess we could call it
a space or in our set R2.

188
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,280
It's there.

189
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,720
It's right there.

190
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,930
So we just said that anything in
R2 can be represented by a

191
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,760
linear combination of
those two guys.

192
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
So clearly, this is in R2, so
it can be represented as a

193
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,850
linear combination.

194
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,940
So hopefully, you're starting
to see the relationship

195
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,810
between span and linear
independence or linear

196
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,370
dependence.

197
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,100
Let me do another example.

198
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,263
Let's say I have the vectors--
let me do a new color.

199
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,620
Let's say I have the vector--
and this one will be a little

200
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,140
bit obvious-- 7, 0, so that's
my v1, and then I have my

201
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,060
second vector, which
is 0, minus 1.

202
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,850
That's v2.

203
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,170
Now, is this set linearly
independent?

204
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,840
Is it linearly independent?

205
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,370
Well, can I represent
either of these as a

206
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,400
combination of the other?

207
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,020
And really when I say as a
combination, you'd have to

208
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,270
scale up one to get the other,
because there's only two

209
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,820
vectors here.

210
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,310
If I am trying to add up to this
vector, the only thing I

211
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,730
have to deal with is this
one, so all I can

212
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,030
do is scale it up.

213
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,850
Well, there's nothing
I can do.

214
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,190
No matter what I multiply this
vector by, you know, some

215
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,520
constant and add it to itself
or scale it up, this term

216
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,400
right here is always
going to be zero.

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,560
It's always going to be zero.

218
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,300
So nothing I can multiply
this by is going to

219
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,970
get me to this vector.

220
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,820
Likewise, no matter what I
multiply this vector by, the

221
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,590
top term is always
going to be zero.

222
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,920
So there's no way I could
get to this vector.

223
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,020
So both of these vectors,
there's no way that you can

224
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,720
represent one as a combination
of the other.

225
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,970
So these two are linearly
independent.

226
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,220
And you can even see
it if we graph it.

227
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,245
One is 7, 0, which
is like that.

228
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,195
Let me do it in a non-yellow
color.

229
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,990
   

230
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,140
7, 0.

231
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,250
And one is 0, minus 1.

232
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,030
And I think you can clearly see
that if you take a linear

233
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,780
combination of any of these
two, you can represent

234
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
anything in R2.

235
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,320
So the span of these, just to
kind of get used to our notion

236
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,550
of span of v1 and v2,
is equal to R2.

237
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,790
Now, this is another interesting
point to make.

238
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,640
I said the span of
v1 and v2 is R2.

239
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,850
Now what is the span of
v1, v2, and v3 in

240
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,810
this example up here?

241
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,550
I already told you.

242
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,170
I already showed you that
this third vector can be

243
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,030
represented as a linear
combination of these two.

244
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,050
It's actually just these
two summed up.

245
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,210
I can even draw it right here.

246
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,620
It's just those two
vectors summed up.

247
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,280
So it clearly can be represented
as a linear

248
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,860
combination of those two.

249
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,670
So what's its span?

250
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,270
Well, the fact that this is
redundant means that it

251
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,200
doesn't change its span.

252
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,000
It doesn't change all of the
possible linear combinations.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,500
So its span is also
going to be R2.

254
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,540
It's just that this was
more vectors than you

255
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,210
needed to span R2.

256
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,210
R2 is a two-dimensional space,
and you needed two vectors.

257
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,180
So this was kind of a more
efficient way of providing a

258
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,830
basis, and I haven't defined
basis formally, yet, but I

259
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,720
just want to use it a little
conversationally, and then

260
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,780
it'll make sense to you when
I define it formally.

261
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,060
This provides a better basis, or
this provides a basis, kind

262
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,460
of a non-redundant set of
vectors that can represent R2.

263
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,910
While this one, right
here, is redundant.

264
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,620
So it's not a good
basis for R2.

265
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,060
Let me give you one more example
in three dimensions.

266
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,940
And then in the next video,
I'm going to make a more

267
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,400
formal definition of linear
dependence or independence.

268
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,205
So let's say that I had
the vector 2, 0, 0.

269
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:45,470
Let me make a similar argument
that I made up there: the

270
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:53,330
vector 2, 0, 0, the vector 0, 1,
0, and the vector 0, 0, 7.

271
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,560
   

272
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,050
We are now in R3, right?

273
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,550
Each of these are
three-dimensional vectors.

274
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,290
Now, are these linear dependent
or linearly

275
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,010
independent?

276
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,080
Sorry, are they linearly
dependent or independent?

277
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Well, there's no way with some
combination of these two

278
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,880
vectors that I can end up with
a non-zero term right here to

279
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
make this third vector, right?

280
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Because no matter what I
multiply this one by and this

281
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,400
one by, this last term
is going to be zero.

282
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,690
So this is kind of adding
a new direction

283
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,640
to our set of vectors.

284
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,810
Likewise, there's nothing
I can do-- there's no

285
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,720
combination of this guy and
this guy that I can get a

286
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,430
non-zero term here.

287
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,930
And finally, no combination of
this guy and this guy that I

288
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,680
can get a non-zero term here.

289
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,035
So this set is linearly
independent.

290
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:43,940
   

291
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,550
And if you were to graph these
in three dimensions, you would

292
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,610
see that none of these--
these three do not

293
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,690
lie on the same plane.

294
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,580
Obviously, any two of them lie
on the same plane, but if you

295
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,730
were to actually graph
it, you get 2, 0.

296
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,350
Let me say that that's x-axis.

297
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,690
That's 2, 0, 0.

298
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,510
Then you have this, 0, 1, 0.

299
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,700
Maybe that's the y-axis.

300
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,370
And then you have 0, 0, 7.

301
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,070
It would look something
like this.

302
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,300
So it almost looks like, your
three-dimensional axes, it

303
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,860
almost looks like the
vectors i, j, k.

304
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,390
They're just scaled
up a little bit.

305
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,410
But you can always correct
that by just scaling them

306
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,160
down, right?

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,240
Because we care about any linear
combination of these.

308
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,090
So the span of these three
vectors right here, because

309
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,580
they're all adding new
directionality, is R3.

310
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,490
   

311
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,690
Anyway, I thought I would leave
you there in this video.

312
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,950
I realize I've been making
longer and longer videos, and

313
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,230
I want to get back in the habit
of making shorter ones.

314
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,270
In the next video, I'm going
to make a more formal

315
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,450
definition of linear dependence,
and we'll do a

316
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,200
bunch more examples.

317
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,515
