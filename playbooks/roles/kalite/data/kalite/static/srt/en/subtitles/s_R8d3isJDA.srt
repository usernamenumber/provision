1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:07,140
We learned in the videos on
torque that torque equals--

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,940
let me actually draw a picture,
so you remember what

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,170
we're talking about
with torque.

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:18,580
So let's say-- so that's the
arm, let's say right here is

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,120
what its pivot is.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,510
That's its pivot.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:30,420
And let's say that I'm putting
a force right there, and it's

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,216
perpendicular to this arm.

10
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:35,540
And let's say the length
of this arm is r.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:45,220
And this force is f.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,000
So we know that the torque
is this force times

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,730
the distance, right?

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,510
   

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,030
And then we also know that--
what is force?

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,390
Well, that is equal
to mass times

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,980
acceleration times distance.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,730
So torque is equal
to mass times

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,090
acceleration times distance.

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,900
And then so what is
acceleration?

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,540
Well that's equal to mass times
change in velocity over

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,240
change in time, times
distance, right?

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,020
So we learned all that from our
torque chapter, and you

24
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,420
might want to review it, just
to get an intuition of what

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,180
torque is good for.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,850
But in general, if something
isn't spinning, you apply

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,080
torque, and you'll
get it spinning.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,560
Or if something is spinning
already, if you apply torque

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
in the direction that it's
spinning, it'll spin faster.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
Or if you go in the opposite
direction, it'll spin slower.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,170
And what I'm showing you here,
is that what happens if you

32
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,690
apply no torque?

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,310
Well if you apply no torque,
then we know that this

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,070
quantity is 0.

35
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,270
Or another way to think about
it-- actually why did I write

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,530
d, it could be d, but I
shouldn't have called this r,

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,590
it should be d.

38
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,950
So if this is 0-- if we are
applying no torque, right--

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,920
what do we know?

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,850
We know that the change in
velocity over change in time,

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,660
times this distance,
won't change-- that

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,760
this quantity is 0.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,020
So we know that the velocity
times the distance is going to

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,270
be a constant.

45
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,230
   

46
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,660
And that comes from what
I just talked about.

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,070
It falls out of Newton's laws,
but it applies to spinning.

48
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,690
An object that's not spinning
will tend to not stay

49
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,480
spinning, and an object
that is spinning will

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,190
tend to stay spinning.

51
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,470
So in this case, if this object
at this point right

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,090
here-- so we're in a case where
there's no torque, so

53
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,770
this force is 0-- there's
no force applying here.

54
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,190
And whatever this object's
velocity was-- its tangential

55
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,490
velocity-- it's going to stay
at that velocity, right?

56
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,300
It's just going to keep spinning
at that velocity.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,940
If I apply more torque it'll
go even faster, if I apply

58
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,600
less torque, it'll slow
down a little bit.

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,510
But we know that this
velocity times

60
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,440
the distance is constant.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,850
And actually, I don't know why
I took this m out-- we know

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,060
that the mass times the velocity
times the distance,

63
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,320
is constant.

64
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,520
Right?

65
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,350
So what does that tell us?

66
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,400
Well, we learned in the angular
velocity video-- my

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,530
mind's a little slow
today-- that what?

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:27,220
Angular velocity is equal to
velocity divided by the

69
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,330
radius, and this case, the
radius is this distance, so we

70
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,730
could also write it as velocity
over distance.

71
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,510
And when I talk about radius,
it's just the radius of the

72
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,760
circle that you're spinning
around in, right?

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,620
This could be the
circle, up here.

74
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,920
So this d, that's the same
thing as the radius.

75
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
I'm just switching letters
to confuse you.

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,210
But let's see if we can write
something, if we can change

77
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,670
this expression to include
angular velocity.

78
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,800
You'll see where I'm
going in a second.

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,070
So let's solve for v.

80
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,560
So let's multiply both sides
of this, times d.

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,450
So you get dw is equal to v.

82
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,890
Right, I just took this d,
put it on this side.

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,740
So let's write that here-- m
times dw-- right, I just

84
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,560
replaced the v-- times d,
is equal to a constant.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,660
Assuming that we have no net
torque on the system.

86
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,130
And so what does that get us?

87
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,310
Well that gets us m times the
angular velocity times d

88
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,490
squared is equal
to a constant.

89
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,340
   

90
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,170
So what does this tell us?

91
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,400
This tells us the mass of an
object spinning-- let me

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,050
rewrite this, because I think--
so what we know is

93
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,300
that the mass of an object
spinning, times how fast it is

94
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,020
spinning, times the distance
to the center of its

95
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,110
rotation-- and actually I'm
going to change that d to an

96
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,370
r, I don't know why I even used
d to begin with-- times

97
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,720
that squared.

98
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,950
That's going to be equal to a
constant, assuming no net

99
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,720
force-- no net torque.

100
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,970
Another way of looking at that,
if we just wanted to go

101
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,420
to angular velocity from the
get-go, we could have said

102
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,870
torque is equal to mass times
change in velocity, times

103
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,840
change in time, times the radius
to the center of where

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
you're rotating around.

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,810
And change in velocity is just
the same thing as mass times

106
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,920
change in angular velocity,
times r.

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,460
Change in time, and then
there's another

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,480
r, that's this r.

109
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,996
Because velocity is angular
velocity times r, and we're

110
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:43,560
assuming r doesn't change, so
any change in velocity is just

111
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,260
going to be a change in
the angular velocity.

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,880
And then we would get the same
thing that we just got here.

113
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
If we have no net torque, we're
going to have no change

114
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
in angular velocity, so angular

115
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,100
velocity will be a constant.

116
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,690
So you'll get mass times angular
velocity, times-- and

117
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,780
then you have this r, and this
r-- times r squared, is going

118
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,790
to be equal to a constant.

119
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,430
Where am I going with
all of this?

120
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,930
Well let's think about
something.

121
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:12,870
Let's say that I have some
object traveling in a circle.

122
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,080
I do everything for a reason,
and you'll see my

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,290
reason right now.

124
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:34,120
Let's say that-- so let's
say this is some type of

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,740
retractable pole, and
I'm an ice skater.

126
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,230
And I'm not using the ice
skater's body right now,

127
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,690
because it'll become
complicated.

128
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,070
Let's say this is some type of
robot arm, and that's its

129
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,050
joint right there.

130
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,440
And it's holding a
mass out here.

131
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,030
   

132
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,730
This is neat because after
this concept, you'll

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,660
understand what goes on in
figure skating, and then the

134
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,930
Olympics-- oh no, the
Winter Olympics are

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,980
over, aren't they?

136
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,830
Anyway, let's say that this
object is spinning

137
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,080
around at some rate.

138
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,750
   

139
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:17,320
It's spinning around at
10 radians a second.

140
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,330
That's its angular velocity.

141
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,570
And let's say, right
now its rotational

142
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:29,560
distance is 10 feet.

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:38,665
So this is spinning on an ice
skating rink, because you

144
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:40,280
don't want friction
and all of that.

145
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,920
So what's its current
angular momentum?

146
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,690
So that's what this term right
here is, angular momentum.

147
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,400
   

148
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,790
So what's its current
angular momentum?

149
00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:00,880
Well its mass times 10, times--
10 is its-- actually,

150
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,920
let's make this radius a
different number, let's call

151
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,810
it 8 feet, just you know
what I'm doing.

152
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,310
So its angular velocity is
10, and then its radius

153
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,560
is 8, so times 64.

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,250
So it equals 640 times mass.

155
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,535
This is its angular momentum.

156
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:19,790
   

157
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,130
Now what happens if this arm,
for whatever reason,

158
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:26,900
shortens-- and maybe it does
something like this, the arm

159
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,950
kind of bends.

160
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,760
And then the mass comes
here, it comes in

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,340
closer to the center.

162
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,900
I'll write that in a
different color.

163
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,280
The mass comes closer to
the center, so now

164
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,659
the radius is 4.

165
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,870
But I've had no net torque on
the system, all I've done is

166
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,450
change how far it is from
the center of rotation.

167
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,660
How much faster is it
going to spin now?

168
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,760
Let's think about it.

169
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,310
Its angular momentum won't
change, this is a constant,

170
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,680
which is its angular momentum.

171
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,940
That won't change.

172
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:01,810
So we now know that the mass
times the angular-- the new

173
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,470
angular momentum, we'll write
that angular momentum 1--

174
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,890
times the new distance squared--
times 16-- is also

175
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,780
going to be equal to 640m.

176
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,860
The angular momentum
doesn't change.

177
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's cross out m from both
sides, and then divide both

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,330
sides by 16.

179
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,790
We now have that w1 is equal
to 16 goes into 640.

180
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,390
So what happened?

181
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,540
Originally, I was going around
at 10 radians per second, when

182
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,400
I halved the radius-- when I
got half as close to the

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,200
center of my rotation, I'm
actually spinning around 4

184
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,540
times as much.

185
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,620
And that's because this term
is a quadratic term.

186
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,860
And you probably have observed
this behavior before, when you

187
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,140
see the ice skater skating
around, and they're spinning

188
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,950
with their arms wide open, and
then they pull their arms in,

189
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,130
and they go a lot, lot,
lot, lot faster.

190
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,700
And that's because their angular
velocity, or the rate

191
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,980
at which they're spinning, is
proportional to the square of

192
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,680
the radius around their
axis of rotation.

193
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,770
Anyway, I hope I didn't confuse
you, and I'll do some

194
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,620
more problems with this in
the future, but I've

195
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,390
just run out of time.

196
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,840
See you soon.
