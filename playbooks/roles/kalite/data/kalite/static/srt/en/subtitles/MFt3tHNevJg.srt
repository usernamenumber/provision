1
00:00:01,172 --> 00:00:03,830
(music playing)

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,026
The Column of Trajan is part of the Forum of Trajan, which is one of the Imperial Fora.

3
00:00:08,026 --> 00:00:11,118
We're looking out at a part of the Forum of Trajan.

4
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:17,151
And unfortunately you cannot have a nice view of the entire square because it has been cut by Medieval walls.

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:25,319
These walls have been cut here, because the excavation in this area has been conducted in the 1990's with new, modern archaeological techniques

6
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,063
meaning that you have to understand the development of a site.

7
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,231
So, even the Medieval aspect of it is important to be preserved.

8
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:41,034
As I'm looking at this remaining piece of the Forum of Trajan, I'm seeing some large marble fragments that are clearly the parts of a column.

9
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:45,845
And, if you walk a little further, we can see a little bit of the original flooring.

10
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:54,007
These remains have been left here instead of being brought inside a museum to really show you a little bit of how lavishly decorated these places were.

11
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:59,231
If you just look at the flooring, it is quite expensive slabs of marble - green and red.

12
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:02,021
Together with green columns and red columns and yellows columns.

13
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:05,437
So even the columns were not all white, they were colorful.

14
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,706
It was about displaying the wealth.

15
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:14,970
Being able to bring marble from all over the empire into Rome meant being a Roman could permit you to bring the empire to you.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,945
Let's go take a look at the Column of Trajan.

17
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:23,611
So, the column. There are 22 different layers. They're not panels because they go around.

18
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,667
So, there's a kind of spiral.

19
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:33,003
And it narrates the two main wars, two main campaigns I should say, that Trajan fought against the Dacians, chronologically.

20
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:39,781
So it goes from the beginning of the war up to the top part, you can barely see, but at the end there is a sacrifice.

21
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:45,101
If you're looking at the some of the scenes, you see that they are like building camps, building bridges.

22
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:51,034
Yes, building the fortifications. And, as we were saying earlier, in a sense, when you're going to bring your army somewhere,

23
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:56,048
you're going to build the infrastructure that's necessary to actually maintain that place.

24
00:01:56,048 --> 00:02:00,687
Yes, and we know that actually the army was the building force during this war,

25
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:05,671
because there would be camps that would remain and would be transformed into cities and roads and things like that.

26
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:13,952
The image of this guy with his back towards us, this building man, is actually a representation of the Danube river, where the campaign started.

27
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:20,292
In Germany? Yes. What is today more or less Austria, Germany, Central Europe.

28
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:23,254
So, that's really a personification of the River Danube? Yes.

29
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:29,689
All rivers are represented as bearded, half-naked men. Usually there are symbols to identify them.

30
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:34,219
For example, another is for the Nile. The she-wolf and the twins for the Tiber River.

31
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,139
In this case you see there are a series of boats and soldiers on top.

32
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:47,742
This is the famous description, we know that Apollodorus of Damascus, to be able to cross the Danube, built an entire bridge of boats to do it.

33
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:50,275
And, this is a faithful narration of what happened.

34
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:53,126
Can I ask you a little bit about the base.

35
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:58,195
The base is representation of typical Dacian weapons and carrasses.

36
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:02,023
So, it's a representation not of the defeated people, you don't see people there.

37
00:03:02,023 --> 00:03:04,837
But, the defeated weapons, so to speak.

38
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:12,312
The enemy here is treated as a valorous opponent, of course, because if you have a weak opponent your strength is not that impressive.

39
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:18,941
The base of the column is actually an oak, it's a victory crown.

40
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,690
I'm still struggling with how it is made.

41
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,176
Those are blocks of marble carved. Inside it's something.

42
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:31,397
You can walk. There's a staircase inside. You can see the small windows. You can go up to the top part.

43
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:36,359
Right at the neck of the personification of the Danube you can see that that's where two blocks join.

44
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,226
Just to get a sense of scale.

45
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:44,632
There are 22 layers and each layer is approximately one yard and the base is also huge.

46
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:50,683
They carved pieces of the band a put them together? Exactly. They carved pieces.

47
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:55,649
Just painted? It was painted over with colors, and colors would have helped to read it.

48
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,140
But still, there was a percentage that was lost.

49
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,063
But, presumably at least, if you ascended the libraries on either side, you'd be able to gain some elevation.

50
00:04:04,063 --> 00:04:11,058
Absolutely yes. Again it's a celebration of the empire. It's the greatness empire, of the Roman people, to be able to bring civilization.

51
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:17,389
It's their ingenuity, it's their engineering prowess, it's their discipline. It's their ability to build.

52
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,002
And those are, of course, attributes that last beyond the victory.

53
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:27,101
And it makes sense to celebrate them here because those are attributes that really take into account the entire grandeur of the city and the culture.

54
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:36,581
Exactly. And, it's also a celebration not just of a victory but of the entire reign of Trajan, so to speak, because he was able to build something, something lasting.

55
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,560
If you think about the Forum, it's still lasting today.

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,266
The idea was celebrate the person in his entirety, not just one of the aspect of his life.

57
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:52,543
