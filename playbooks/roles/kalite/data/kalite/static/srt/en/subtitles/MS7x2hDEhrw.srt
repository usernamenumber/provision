1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:03,640
The earth is now starting to get closer

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:08,369
to being hospitable to people or animals like us

3
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,706
In the last video we saw, during the

4
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:15,076
Proterozoic eon, oxygen began to accumulate

5
00:00:15,076 --> 00:00:16,432
in the atmosphere.

6
00:00:16,432 --> 00:00:18,178
This actually caused this first snowball earth

7
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:21,639
and this mass extinction of all the anaerobic species

8
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:25,131
that made conditions suitable for eukaryotic cells

9
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,660
and maybe even more important,

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,675
these eukaryotic cells were able to form

11
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:32,014
multicellular organisms, and we see where that starts

12
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:35,258
right here on this chart.

13
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:38,130
Multicellular life starts right over here.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,521
And I want to be clear, all of these things are moving targets

15
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,333
as we discover more things in the geological

16
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,711
record and we get more tools at our disposal

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,150
these numbers get tweaked.

18
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,486
But they do give you a good sense,

19
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,358
based on our current understanding

20
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:52,143
of when these things start to appear.

21
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,731
And coinciding with multicellular

22
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,533
life, and this is interesting in its own right

23
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,169
because it has its own meta-level effect on evolution,

24
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:07,288
you actually start also having sexual reproduction.

25
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,850
And what's interesting about this,

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,199
why this has such a big impact on evolution,

27
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,618
we talk about it a lot in the biology playlist,

28
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,897
is before evolution, variation in DNA had to be

29
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:22,125
completely dependent on mutations and random movements

30
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,411
within DNA and maybe some viruses.

31
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:27,944
Now with sexual reproduction, you had

32
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:30,712
a systematic mixing of DNA,

33
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:32,730
so that you got more variation in the gene pool

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,387
which allowed more selection, more variance to select for

35
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:41,420
and so you kind of had an acceleration

36
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,992
in the actual pace of evolution.

37
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:47,688
We're talking, I've looked at a bunch of sources,

38
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,230
they say from 1.2 billion, 1.5 billion,

39
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,061
a little bit over a billion

40
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:56,828
you start having these multicellular lifeforms

41
00:01:56,828 --> 00:01:59,106
and sexual reproduction.

42
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:01,081
The other thing that we talked about from

43
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,776
the Proterozoic eon, is the accumulation of oxygen

44
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:06,952
allowed the ozone layer to build up.

45
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:10,994
Ozone is just three oxygen atoms, it is O3.

46
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:14,720
And by the end of the Proterozoic eon

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,064
so we're talking about 550 million years ago

48
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:22,306
(give or take a hundred million years)

49
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,803
(these are all moving targets)

50
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:26,742
the ozone layer was dense enough to protect

51
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:28,697
the land from UV rays, we talked about that

52
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:31,844
in the last video.

53
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:34,303
The Earth is being bombarded with UV rays

54
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,174
and the ozone layer is the only thing that

55
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:39,899
keeps us from being seriously irradiated by the sun

56
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:42,585
and allows land animals to actually live.

57
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:45,138
And so coinciding with that time

58
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:47,762
period, around 550 million years ago,

59
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:50,413
you start to have life colonizing,

60
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,697
especially significant life colonizing land.

61
00:02:53,697 --> 00:03:00,735
Life colonizes the land.

62
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,023
And this was an interesting, when I first learned it,

63
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:05,176
kind of an "Aha!" moment.

64
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:09,753
You always assume that trees and grasses

65
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:10,670
are part of the background,

66
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,316
they come part and parcel with land,

67
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:16,383
but it turns out that animals colonized land

68
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:18,382
before plants did.

69
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:21,319
Plants didn't come into the picture before about

70
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,024
450 million years ago, give or take a few tens of

71
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:27,710
millions of years.

72
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,736
And so we're now entering the end of the

73
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:32,062
Proterozoic eon.

74
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:34,069
Life has started to colonize land,

75
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,188
we now have an ozone layer,

76
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:39,491
and actually there's another snowball glaciation

77
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:41,860
or snowball earth near the end of the

78
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,858
Proterozoic eon, and there are a bunch of theories

79
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,339
about why it came about and why it disappeared

80
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:50,621
maybe there were volcanoes

81
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,430
greenhouse gases, who knows.

82
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,260
But as we enter the end of that,

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,507
we start seeing life begin to flourish.

84
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:00,263
And it starts to really flourish as we enter

85
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:03,574
the (I always have trouble saying this)

86
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:06,374
Phanerozoic eon

87
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,921
It's not even labelled here.

88
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:13,025
The Phanerozoic eon is this chunk of time

89
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,513
right over here, let me write it out.

90
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,232
This right over here is the

91
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:23,787
Phanerozoic eon.

92
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:27,676
These divisions right here are eons

93
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:32,111
and then they break into eras.

94
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,174
Eras are subsets of eons.

95
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,862
They're hundreds of millions of years.

96
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:37,435
This is the Paleozoic era,

97
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:40,259
the Mesozoic era and the Cenozoic era.

98
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,008
And that's actually our current era.

99
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:45,039
But perhaps the most interesting,

100
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,296
I don't want to pick favorites here,

101
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:48,536
but it's one of the most interesting times in the

102
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,474
geologic era

103
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:56,683
is the first period in the Paleozoic era,

104
00:04:56,683 --> 00:05:02,247
which is the first era in the Phanerozoic eon -

105
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:04,584
and that's the Cambrian period.

106
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:05,548
You might have heard of it before,

107
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:11,575
that's about this period of time here.

108
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:16,471
Cambrian. And during this period of

109
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:19,527
time, the earth experiences what we call

110
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,632
the Cambrian Explosion. That's because there

111
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:27,079
was just this explosion in the number of species

112
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,618
and genera that existed, the biodiversity

113
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,750
on the planet.

114
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,363
It might just be that we had the ozone layer protecting us,

115
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,979
things were colonizing land,

116
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,159
it was an oxygen rich environment.

117
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:43,017
We start seeing complex multicellular organisms,

118
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,970
it's about that time.

119
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,311
If you fast forward maybe a few tens of millions of years,

120
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,243
you start seeing the first fish,

121
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:52,901
the first pre-amphibians or proto-amphibians.

122
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:56,404
You fast forward a little bit as we get out of

123
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,297
the Cambrian period, we start seeing

124
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:05,255
plants, so they draw it right over here.

125
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,885
And of course these are moving targets depending

126
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:10,352
on what we discover in the fossil record.

127
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:14,455
And for me, the big "Aha!" moment here is

128
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,194
so many of these things you consider fundamental to

129
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:21,594
what Earth is a relatively recent phenomenon.

130
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:26,761
Plants weren't on land until about 450 million years ago.

131
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,632
Insects weren't on land, or did not even exist

132
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:33,512
until about 400 million years ago.

133
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:36,399
Reptiles didn't exist until 300 million years ago.

134
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,145
So we're about right over here now.

135
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,793
Mammals didn't exist until 200 million years ago.

136
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:46,255
Birds didn't exist until about 150 million years ago.

137
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:47,961
The whole dinosaur age, which we consider

138
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:53,627
in our distant past, that's essentially the Mesozoic era.

139
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,792
So this is essentially the age of the dinosaurs.

140
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,279
When you look at your time clock you see

141
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,254
it's a relatively recent time period,

142
00:07:02,254 --> 00:07:05,129
and it actually ends with, we currently believe,

143
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,685
a huge rock, a 6-mile diameter rock

144
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:11,260
colliding with what is now

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,652
the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, right off the coast

146
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:15,793
of the Yucatan Peninsula.

147
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:18,407
And it destroyed all of the large land lifeforms ,

148
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,825
especially the dinosaurs.

149
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,147
And to put all of this in perspective,

150
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:24,947
and actually the thing that really was an

151
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,821
"Aha!" moment for me,

152
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,773
plants are 450 million years ago,

153
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:33,916
grass I view as this fundamental thing in nature,

154
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:34,926
but grass has only been

155
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:36,352
around for about

156
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:39,172
(I've seen multiple estimates) 40-70 million years.

157
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:43,073
Grass is a relatively new thing on the planet.

158
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:46,386
Flowers have only been around for 130 million years.

159
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,386
So there was a time when you had dinosaurs,

160
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,916
but you did not have flowers

161
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,623
and you did not have grass.

162
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:54,729
And so you fast forward all the way,

163
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,725
when you look at this scale it's funny to look at,

164
00:07:56,725 --> 00:08:00,102
this is where the dinosaurs showed up,

165
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:03,620
this brown line is where the mammals showed up,

166
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,622
so the dinosaurs showed up along with the mammals

167
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:09,421
and then of course the dinosaurs died out here.

168
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:13,965
Our ancestors, when the giant rock hit the earth,

169
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:15,551
must have been burrowed in holes

170
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,931
and were able to stash some food away,

171
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,662
or who knows what, and didn't get fully affected.

172
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:22,671
I'm sure most of the large mammals were destroyed,

173
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:26,105
But what's humbling or almost humorous or

174
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,534
almost ridiculous when you look at this chart,

175
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:31,854
they put a little dot, you can't see it here,

176
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:34,561
2 million years ago, the first humans.

177
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,682
And even this is being pretty generous when they say

178
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,435
first humans, these are really the first pre-humans.

179
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,644
The first humans that are the same as us,

180
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,410
if you took one of those babies

181
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,929
and you brought them up in the suburbs and

182
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,198
gave them haircuts and stuff, they would be

183
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,948
the same thing as we are,

184
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:52,290
those didn't exist until 200,000 years ago.

185
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,249
200,000 to 400,000 years ago, I've seen estimates.

186
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,068
So this actually a very generous

187
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:01,366
period of time to say first humans,

188
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,876
it's actually 200,000 years ago.

189
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,761
And just to give you an idea of how new we are

190
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,978
and how new our evolution is, it was only

191
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:12,791
5 million years ago, and I mentioned this

192
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,809
in a previous video,

193
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,216
it was only 5 million years ago.

194
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,299
So this is just to get a sense.

195
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,423
This is 0 years.

196
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:22,424
Homo sapiens sapiens only around for 200,000 years.

197
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,886
The neanderthals, they were cousin species,

198
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,308
they weren't our ancestors, many people

199
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,262
think they were - they were cousin species,

200
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,793
we come from the same root,

201
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:32,160
although there are now theories that they might have

202
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,174
remixed in with homo sapiens, so maybe some of us

203
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,773
have some Neanderthal DNA,

204
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,202
and it shouldn't be viewed as an insult,

205
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,236
they had big brains, well,

206
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:43,243
they didn't actually have big brains,

207
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:46,346
they had big heads, but that seems to imply big brains

208
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,477
but who knows, we always tend to portray them as

209
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,660
somehow inferior, but I don't want to get into the

210
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,629
political correctness of how to portray

211
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:57,167
neanderthals, but anyway but this is a very small

212
00:09:57,167 --> 00:10:00,095
period of time.

213
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,183
If you go 2 million years then you get to

214
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:05,397
the pre-human ancestors and

215
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:10,594
our family tree, only diverged from the chimpanzees

216
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:15,003
5 million years ago. If you draw that on this clock

217
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:17,192
it would barely make... it would be like 2 pixels

218
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:18,734
or maybe not even 2 pixels,

219
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,940
is when we diverged from the chimpanzees.

220
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,455
So hopefully that gives you a sense of things,

221
00:10:23,455 --> 99:59:59,999
at least for me it really puts things in perspective.
