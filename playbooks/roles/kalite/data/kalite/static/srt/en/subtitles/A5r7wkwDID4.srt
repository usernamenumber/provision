1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,910
I mentioned in the last video
that 99% of the aromatic

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,330
compounds that you'll see in a
chemistry or organic chemistry

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,240
class is either going to be
benzene or a molecule derived

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,490
from benzene.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,250
   

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,370
So what I want to do in this
video is just familiarize you

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,350
with some of these molecules
and how to name them.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,810
So you know what you're
looking at.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,730
Or I guess so you could name
what you're looking at.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,440
So you've seen this
multiple times.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,850
Benzene just looks like this.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,300
It's a six carbon ring with
three double bonds.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,900
These three double
bonds like that.

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,260
And that's not it's only
configuration.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,000
Sometimes it's shown to
be in resonance with

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,060
this form right here.

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,030
So the double bonds all flip
around the circle, like that.

19
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,960
Or sometimes it's simply
drawn like this.

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,870
And I talked about this
in the last video.

21
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,290
Just to show that really
neither of these

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,200
configurations is
exactly right.

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,690
That these pi electrons, they're
just moving around the

24
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,670
entire ring.

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,930
So and sometimes you'll just
have the hexagon with a circle

26
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,720
on the inside to show that the
pi electrons are just floating

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,710
around the entire ring.

28
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,360
Now if I were to add something
to the benzene ring, it's

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,810
pretty straightforward
to name it.

30
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,000
So say I have this molecule
right here.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,860
   

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,880
So let's see I have that.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,120
That's benzene.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,250
But let's say this carbon
over here, it has

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,810
one, two, three bonds.

36
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,810
If I didn't draw anything else,
you'd just assume that

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,340
there's also a hydrogen here.

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,380
But maybe there's no
hydrogen there.

39
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,340
Let me do this in a
different color.

40
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,550
Maybe you have a
chlorine there.

41
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,630
Well this is just
chlorobenzene.

42
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,590
   

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,410
If that was a bromine, it
would be bromobenzene.

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,320
So pretty straightforward.

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,230
Let me draw it.

46
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,340
Let me actually change
it a little bit.

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,950
Let's say you had
a chloro there.

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,980
And let's say you had,
oh I don't know.

49
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,140
Let's say you had a
bromo over here.

50
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,610
Let's say you have a
bromo over there.

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,860
Draw the bromo.

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,140
   

53
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,000
So you can just start
numbering.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,090
You can actually start numbering
in either place.

55
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,750
Let's start with the bromine.

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,400
It's alphabetically in front.

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:27,170
So this would be 1-bromo,
2-chlorobenzene.

58
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,860
   

59
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,200
Pretty straightforward.

60
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,640
Now it gets a little
bit more involved.

61
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,950
The IUPAC, which we know is kind
of the group that named

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,200
most things.

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,390
   

64
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,710
Everything else we've seen so
far, they came up with a

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,090
separate naming mechanism
from the common names.

66
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,930
But benzene, it's so ingrained
in the organic chemistry

67
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,190
community, that all of the
benzene or benzene derivative

68
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,160
molecules, they just kind of
said, well you know what,

69
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,630
we're just going to use the
names that everyone uses.

70
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,170
So here's a couple of common
benzene derivatives.

71
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,470
So if you have this molecule
right here.

72
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,120
Let me-- if you have this
molecule right here-- I'll

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,510
actually draw the pi electrons
as a circle.

74
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,550
Actually I'll draw it with
the double bonds.

75
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,530
So let's say you have this
molecule right here.

76
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,470
And over here you have an OH.

77
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,300
You have an OH right there.

78
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,550
This is called a phenol.

79
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,630
   

80
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,980
So it's not called a
benzene anymore.

81
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,700
And if you had a molecule
that looked like this,

82
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,010
so just like a phenol.

83
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,130
So essentially it is a phenol.

84
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,140
But let's say you have a
bromine right there.

85
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,670
What you do is you start
numbering at the group that's

86
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,940
making this is a phenol.

87
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,050
So you start numbering there.

88
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,380
One and then you
get to the two.

89
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,140
So this is 2-bromo.

90
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,390
This is 2-bromophenol.

91
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,710
   

92
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,970
And unfortunately this is one of
those things that you just

93
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,810
kind of have to memorize.

94
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,180
That a phenol is really just a
benzene ring with an OH group.

95
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,570
Another one that is probably
a good idea to memorize.

96
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,130
I mean at least for me in
organic chemistry, the most

97
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,019
confusing thing is when someone
says the name of a

98
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,490
molecule that sounds like they
expect you to understand.

99
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,459
But you don't understand it.

100
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,420
So it's, I guess, a good
idea to understand as

101
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,270
many names as possible.

102
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,140
So if you just have a benzene
ring, and you just have a

103
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,190
methyl group attached to
that benzene ring,

104
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,780
this is called toluene.

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,810
   

106
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:44,550
And once again let's
say you had a

107
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,070
fluorine right over there.

108
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:52,240
This would be one, two,
three fluorotulene.

109
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,500
I always have trouble
saying that.

110
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,560
So it's one, two, three.

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,940
You start at the group
that's kind of

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,170
making this the toluene.

113
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,610
So let me make it a little
bit clearer.

114
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,805
So this would be
3-fluorotoluene.

115
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:07,540
   

116
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,560
This would all be in one word.

117
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
I just wrote it up here
to save some space.

118
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,910
Now a couple of other ones
that you'll see.

119
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,640
And once again, as you know, if
you watched many, many Khan

120
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,040
Academy videos, I hate
memorizing things.

121
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,300
But these are just names.

122
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,330
And these aren't systematically
derived.

123
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,540
The chemistry community just
uses them, because that's the

124
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,340
way they've heard them.

125
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,750
So it is one of those things you
kind of have to memorize.

126
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:37,560
So if you have a benzene ring,
where the functional group

127
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,060
that is kind of defining the
benzene ring, it's essentially

128
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,070
becoming an amine.

129
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,850
We haven't actually covered
videos on amines yet.

130
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,130
And I'll do that in
a future video.

131
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,410
But it's essentially, it's
replaced one of the hydrogens

132
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,660
in ammonia.

133
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,690
Let me draw ammonia.

134
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,630
Ammonia has three hydrogens
and one lone pair.

135
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,250
Here we've replaced one
of the hydrogens.

136
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,640
Actually there's two
hydrogens here.

137
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,090
We've replaced one of the
hydrogens with a benzene ring.

138
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,700
This type of thing you
call an aniline.

139
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,480
   

140
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,950
Right there.

141
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,860
And the same idea.

142
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,400
If I put a fluoro here, this
would be 2-fluoroaniline.

143
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,970
So you use whatever the base
molecule is, and then you just

144
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,020
name it, really the way we've
named a lot of things before.

145
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,530
And I'll just introduce you to
two more, just so that you

146
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,560
have them under your belt.

147
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,290
So that you'll have seen them
before if anyone introduces

148
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,210
them to you.

149
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,160
And they're really introducing
groups that we'll study in

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,310
more detail in the future.

151
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,650
But if you have a benzene
ring once again.

152
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,180
So we have a benzene ring.

153
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,730
And then you have a
carboxyl group.

154
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,900
And we'll talk more about
carboxyl groups in the future.

155
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,010
But it creates carboxylic
acid.

156
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,490
This thing right here, this
hydrogen, it can actually be

157
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,560
released quite easily.

158
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,480
And we'll talk about
that in the future.

159
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,305
This right here is called
benzoic acid.

160
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:01,230
   

161
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,380
And this name, actually
there is a little bit

162
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,430
more logic to this.

163
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,330
You have the benz part
for the benzene.

164
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,880
So let me make this in
different colors.

165
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,400
The benzene part, that gives
us the benz right there.

166
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,130
And then in general, whenever
you have a carboxyl group like

167
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,680
this, it becomes a
carboxylic acid.

168
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,600
And you tend to add the
-oic acid to the end.

169
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,750
So this actually has some
logical naming to it.

170
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,620
Now the last one I'll introduce
you to is very

171
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,120
similar to this.

172
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,100
Instead of having an OH right
here, we just have a hydrogen.

173
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,590
It would be an aldehyde.

174
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,590
So let me draw that.

175
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,930
And you could almost
imagine what

176
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,600
that's going to be called.

177
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
It's benzaldehyde.

178
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,150
So let me draw it.

179
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,650
So you have your benzene ring.

180
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,760
   

181
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,400
And then instead of this
carboxyl group, you have an

182
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,990
aldehyde group.

183
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,810
You have your carbon.

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,200
There's implicitly
a carbon here.

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,230
Let me make that, just in
case it's the first time

186
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,090
you're seeing it.

187
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:58,930
You have a carbon there.

188
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,030
Instead of an OH group, you
have just a hydrogen.

189
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,240
And so once again you
have a benzene.

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,780
So it actually makes sense to
put the benz over there.

191
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,900
And then you have the
aldehyde group.

192
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,730
Then you have an aldehyde
group right over here.

193
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,205
So this is called a
benzaldehyde, or this molecule

194
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:21,470
is called benzaldehyde.

195
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,940
And we'll study amines and
aldehydes and carboxylic acids

196
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,540
in much more detail in future
videos, and actually see

197
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,710
reactions that involve them.

198
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,770
But I just wanted to
expose you to this.

199
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,929
And so when you see these kinds
of names, you don't

200
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,179
become intimidated.

201
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,334
