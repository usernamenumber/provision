00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:07,129
Draw a circle and label the radius, diameter, center, and circumference.

2
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,634
Let me draw a circle, and it won't be that well-drawn of a circle, but I think you get the idea.

3
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:18,506
So that is my circle. I'm going to label the center over here. So I'll do the center--I'll call it "C."

4
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:27,051
So that is my center. And I'll draw an arrow there. That is the center of the circle. And actually, the circle itself is the set of

5
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:33,135
all points that are a fixed distance away from that center. And that fixed distance away that they're all

6
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:42,253
from that center, that is the radius. So let me draw the radius. So this distance right over here is the radius.

7
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:49,528
That is the radius. And that's going to be the same as this distance, which is the same as that distance.

8
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:56,169
I can draw multiple radii. All of these are radii. The distance between the center and any point on the

9
00:00:56,169 --> 00:01:03,430
circle. Now, a diameter just goes straight across the circle, going through the center, from one side

10
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:10,194
of the circle to the other side, going through the center. And it's essentially two radii put together.

11
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:16,788
So, for example, this would be a diameter. That would be a diameter. You have one radii, then another

12
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:23,244
radii, all one line, going from one side of the circle to the other, going through the center. So that

13
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:29,931
is a diameter. That is a diameter. And I could have drawn it other ways. I could have drawn it like this.

14
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:34,267
That would be another diameter. But they're going to have the exact same length. And then finally, we

15
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:38,522
have to think about the circumference. And the circumference is really just how far you have to go to

16
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:44,002
go around the circle. Or if you put a string on the circle, how long would that string have to be.

17
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:50,333
So, what I'm tracing out in blue right now, the length of what I'm tracing out, is the circumference.

18
00:01:50,333 --> 99:59:59,999
So, right over here, that is the circumference. Circumference. And we're done.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Draw a circle and label the radius, diameter, center and circumference.
