1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:04,267
Graph x is less than 4.

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:07,467
So, let's draw ourselves a numberline overhere.

3
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:12,005
So let me draw a number line.

4
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,467
Let me put ....I'll start here 0.

5
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:20,333
1-2-3-4-5

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,600
And we can go below 0

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,600
-1,-2,-3,-4 and I can go on

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,800
now we wanna graph all of the Xs that are less than 4

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,667
but we're not including 4

10
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,467
it's not less or equal than 4

11
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,314
it's less than 4

12
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:39,800
and to show that we're not including 4

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,794
what we're going to do is that we're going to draw a circle around 4

14
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,600
so this shows us that we're not including 4

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,067
if we were including 4

16
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,600
I would make that a solid dot

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,000
To show that we're going to do all of the values less than 4

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,200
we'll shade in the number line below 4 going down from 4

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,442
just like that just like that

20
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:06,400
and we can shade in the arrow just like that

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,933
here is all of the values less than 4

22
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,267
and you can test it out

23
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,467
take any value where there is blue

24
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,067
so there is blue overhere

25
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:20,875
-2,-2 is definitely less than 4

26
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:24,667
if you take this value right here, this 2. It's definitely less than 4.

27
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,933
4 is not included, because 4 is not less than 4.

28
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,533
It's equal to 4.

29
00:01:29,533 --> 99:59:59,999
5 is not included because 5 is not less than 4.
