1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:03,964
So let's review the situation that has been emerging in Greece

2
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:06,881
and then dig a little bit deeper as to their options.

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:11,631
So as we saw in the last video, Greece was spending

4
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:16,451
a lot more then it was bringing in tax revenues.

5
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:19,980
So it was running these deficits, and year after year

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,374
these deficits were piling up and the national debt was increasing.

7
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:29,641
And to make matters worse, Greece actually tried to cover this up

8
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,515
for many years with some accounting shenanigans,

9
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:38,952
because there were some European Central Bank rules about how much debt you could take on.

10
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,689
So it was trying to not trigger those rules while still being able to

11
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:47,797
take on more debt, so that it could fund this spending.

12
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,372
But then, in the last few years it became clear,

13
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:53,558
the shenanigans were cleared up. And when they were cleared up;

14
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:56,815
one, it made people realize, wow, that was kinda shady what they did

15
00:00:56,815 --> 00:01:06,965
and on top that, they had a much larger government public debt burden then people thought.

16
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:13,479
And the combination of the two, that the country was trying to not make its obligations

17
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,792
apparent and to be transparent to the market,

18
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,711
and on top of that, that this debt burden was so huge.

19
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:25,043
It made people wary of whether the country would actually be able

20
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:29,558
to fulfill its obligations. So trust,

21
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:32,098
investor trust, when I talk about investors, I'm taking about the people

22
00:01:32,098 --> 00:01:34,719
who would invest in Greek bonds. So essentially, the lenders to Greece.

23
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,230
Their trust went down, and they expected higher interest.

24
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,598
Higher interest from the Greek Government, and that made things worse.

25
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:48,296
Now not only they had to keep spending on all their entitlements,

26
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:52,230
but now the cost of funding that existing debt that they already had

27
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,731
and the new debt that they had to do to keep spending at that rate,

28
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:58,189
the cost of that debt itself went up.

29
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,880
And that only kinda added fuel to this balloning debt problem.

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,637
Now in the last video, we explored a couple of options.

31
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:10,079
In particular, we said what about austerity?

32
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,567
What about the situation where you just really, mainly you could

33
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:16,667
try to increase your revenue or slah spending, but people really try to focus on the spending side.

34
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:19,767
What if really just slashed the spending,

35
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,664
in a very severe way? Realy jist cut straight to the bone.

36
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,964
Well, there's a couple of problems there.

37
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:30,722
One problem was that it is not popular at all

38
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:34,464
and then the bigger problem was that you are already in the recession,

39
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:40,764
and this could make the recession even more severe

40
00:02:40,764 --> 00:02:45,516
...recession more severe...

41
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:48,448
Frankly, it was not popular, it is never popular

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,299
but as we move now, in 2012, is even less popular

43
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,714
because Greece has already gone through couple of rounds of this austerity,

44
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:01,482
This is not a new problem, they´ve been bailed out in small ways,

45
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,298
and I´ll talk more about what a bail out is,

46
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:06,214
as part of that package, people who were bailing them out

47
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:08,730
said, look if we´are going to give you something

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,164
if we are going to use some of our tax payers money to help you out,

49
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:15,330
you´ve got to cut your spending. But what is happening in every round of austerity so far,

50
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,415
is that it helps slow the economy even further.

51
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:22,364
The recession kept deepening and deepening and it kind of common sence that it would,

52
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:28,415
if government stops spending in a big way, it slows down already slow economy.

53
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:33,520
The other thing you might be saying is - why doesn't Greece just stop paying its debt?

54
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,268
Why doesn´t it just default on its debt?

55
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:44,799
So like, sorry investors that you have to take a loss here but we just not paying anymore.

56
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,848
Well, the problem is that it has a situation when spending more than it is bringing in

57
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:54,164
and its obligations are all in the euro.

58
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:58,681
It does not have its own currency. And so, if they would be on default on their debt,

59
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:02,016
obviously the people who lended them money would be very upset,

60
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:05,447
and there is not way they are going to lend more money to Greece.

61
00:04:05,447 --> 00:04:10,549
And if they do not lend more euros to Greece,

62
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,331
Greece is not going to be able to continue spending euros the way it has.

63
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:18,964
it is promising all of their pensions, retirees, unemployment insurance,..

64
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,134
it is paying all these obligations in euros

65
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:25,375
and if they default, they are not going to be able borrow more euros to do those obligations

66
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:29,496
and once again, it will be kind of very fast and violent austerity

67
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,913
because there wouldn't be even the money to fund

68
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:37,481
and you would have this kind of drastic,..almost shut down of the government.

69
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,330
So, this right over here is not a good option.

70
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,414
Now, to start exploring the third option

71
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:45,430
and this is kind of the option it seems likely that Greece might have to going.

72
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,998
Let´s think about what Greece could have done

73
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:52,581
if it had monetary independence. If it had it´s own currency.

74
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:56,551
Just remember, this is completely hypothetical,

75
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:00,064
Greece did have its own currency, the drachma, before it joined the euro,

76
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:03,031
but let's think about what it could have done in this situation

77
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:07,190
if it actually did have its own currency.

78
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,119
It is not cut-and-dry here because Greece was

79
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,115
actualy able to historically borrowed at very cheap rates,

80
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:15,481
because it was part of this EuroZone. But let's just think about it

81
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:20,148
if it wasn't the situation, what it could of done if had its own central bank.

82
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:24,114
So this is some of our stats from our last video,

83
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:27,614
and if it has its own central bank, let me make this very clear,

84
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:32,601
this is all hypothetical, Greece does have no its own central bank right now,

85
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:37,781
for all of the Eurozone countries, the euro is printed by the European central bank,

86
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,453
it is not by anyone country. But - hypothetically, let's say

87
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:48,997
Greece does has its own central bank. So, Greek central bank...

88
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:51,698
that prints its own, let's call new drachma.

89
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,913
And so that Greek Central bank in this type of the situation

90
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:59,847
could just start printing drachma and essentially

91
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:04,749
use that drachma to buy government bonds

92
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:08,248
so essentially printing that money and buy government bonds

93
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:11,400
it is lending it to the government. It lends to the government

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:19,549
so that the government could spend on its entitlements, on all of its various obligations.

95
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:22,797
Now, that may seen very convinient, essentially one part of the government

96
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:25,797
or something associated with the government, prints money,

97
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:28,303
essentially lends it to the government, funds its obligations

98
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:30,103
but the immediate thing you may say is "well, hey..

99
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:32,614
..if you just print currency like this, willy-nilly,

100
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:43,380
won't this lead to an inflation?" And the simple answer is, it probably will.

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,848
But that actually might be the solution, if you are in conundrum like Greece is in.

102
00:06:48,848 --> 00:06:51,641
First of all, inflation might not be so bad,

103
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,464
Right now the country is in a deep recession, so there

104
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:56,445
is all the extra capacity, you might even have a little bit

105
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:59,367
of price cushion. And just in general the inflation rates

106
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:03,230
aren't ultra dramatic, there are not super low but not

107
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,330
super high either, so there might be some.. you may not have to worry

108
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,881
about kind of hyper-inflationary situation, but on top of that

109
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,336
the government probably wants a respectable amount

110
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,113
of inflation, might not want 100% or 1000% of inflation

111
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:20,530
but it might like 10%, 20% or 30% yearly inflation.

112
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,047
And to think about that, think about the idea, in this hypothetical Greece,

113
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:27,605
all of its obligations wouldn't be in euro, its obligations

114
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:31,337
would be in drachma. And so, you can imagine a world,

115
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:33,516
let's think about hypothetical Greece and I'm going to use

116
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:36,498
hypothetical numbers, just to make things more simple

117
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,458
to understand or to do in our heads, let's take this hypothetical Greece,

118
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,780
but it could be Greece or any other country, and let's say it has a GDP ...

119
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:57,515
...GDP of 100, let's call it 100 of its currency, ...100 drachma is its GDP,

120
00:07:57,515 --> 00:08:09,000
and let's say it has its entitlement obligations,..and this is all on the annual basis,..

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,710
...and let's say 10 billion of its currency, of its drachma. This is not the situation of Greece as

122
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,480
all its obligations are in euros but let's just think about the situation

123
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,194
and let's say that on top of that it has debt obligations, total debt, total value of debt

124
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:31,935
let's say that it was, ... I don't know,..there was another 150 billion of its currency.

125
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:37,169
Let's say you inflate over couple of years, so inflation occurs,

126
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,446
and let's say you have 100% of inflation over few years

127
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:44,215
but in real terms your GDP doesn't change, ....so in real terms

128
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:50,213
if you have 100% inflation but you producing the same amount,

129
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:55,964
the nominal value of your GDP will now be 200 billion.

130
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:59,515
It is the same amout of goods and services but everything now costs twice as much,

131
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,998
so you would value it to 200 billion. If you would have your

132
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:05,397
inflation adjusted, it would still be 100 billion. The good thing,

133
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:08,139
and it is very seldom that you use inflation to good context,

134
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,463
but it would be good for Greece in this situation, that these

135
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:15,756
entitlement obligations, they would still be 10 billion.

136
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:18,401
You still going to say " I'm gonna to still pay you 10 billion" even if that 10 billion

137
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:22,181
is goign to buy people half as much. That is much easy to do politically

138
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:28,637
than telling people over night that I'm going to reduce your pension by half. This is political suicide.

139
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:32,565
But to inflate away the obligations, nominally it looks like you paying the same thing

140
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:36,054
but just buying less, it is a little bit more viable to do.

141
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:38,200
And the same thing is to review debt obligations.

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,731
Your debt obligations won't adjust the inflation, and so you would still owe

143
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:49,326
150 billion but as the percentage of GDP you've halved how big the debt is,

144
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:54,081
you've halved how big the entitlement obligations are. So there is actually a viable solution

145
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:57,110
and in this hypothetical situation is probably the best solution

146
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:04,622
for government to essentially inflate away its obligations.

147
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:09,266
So, I'll leave you with that, something for you to think about and then we can think about

148
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:12,982
what could Greece actually do in this directions but more importantly

149
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:16,564
let's think about, and you can start to think why is the whole world so scared,

150
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:20,965
all of this is Greece, it is relatively small country, so why is whole Eurozone

151
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:25,103
so scared, why are people thinking about bailing out Greece

152
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:27,756
in some way to prevent all this craziness from happening

153
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:31,898
and what are the repercussion in the larger global market.

154
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:34,933
But I'll leave you there and leave you to think about all this stuff.
