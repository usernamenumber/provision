1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:04,378
We've been talking a lot about elasticities of a demand,

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,160
so you were probably wondering,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,193
can we think about elasticities of a supply?

4
00:00:10,193 --> 00:00:12,468
And as you can imagine, the answer is:

5
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:13,499
of course we can!

6
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:14,915
And it's interesting to think about

7
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:18,405
how does the quantity the percent change in quantity supplied

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,327
relate to percent change in prices

9
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:23,670
So, for example, let's say we have

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,695
a lemonade stand of some sort.

11
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:28,422
So this is price on that axis

12
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:30,559
and that is quantity on that axis.

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,359
And let's say that our supply curve

14
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,155
looks something like that

15
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,796
Obviously, the higher the price,

16
00:00:35,796 --> 00:00:37,905
the more quantity we are willing to supply.

17
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:42,924
And let's say at a price of $1,

18
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:47,140
the quantity supplied is going to be 10 gallons/week.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,357
this is going to be 10 gallons/week.

20
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:55,094
So the quantity of supplies is going to be 10 gallons per week.

21
00:00:55,094 --> 00:01:03,293
And let's say that if the price goes to $2,

22
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:10,892
the quantity supplied goes to 16 gallons per week.

23
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:14,562
So what is the elasticity of supply,

24
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:17,495
roughly, over this period right over here?

25
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:22,343
So the elasticity... elasticity of supply, and you can imagine

26
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:31,905
how we can calcalute this as % change in quantity supplied over our

27
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:36,260
% change in price, so what is our percent

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:44,090
change in price, well we went from $1 to $2, (so this part right over here) is going to be

29
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,995
we went up by $1,

30
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:49,867
so we went up by $1 per gallon,

31
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:57,533
so it's going up by $1,and we all use our starting point as base we can do in traditionally finding of percent change

32
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:01,308
because we have the same percent change , if we're going from 1 to 2, as from 2 to 1

33
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:08,493
so instead the conventionally we think about elasticity is to use the mid-point of these two, use the average of these two

34
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:17,822
so 1+2 is 3, 3/2 is 1,5. So it's 1 over $1.50. We can say, $1,50 is right in between these two things.

35
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:29,022
and 1 over $1,50 this is about 67 % roughly, so this is approximatelly 67%

36
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:32,626
change in price based on how we just calculate it, how we're using

37
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:35,658
the midpoint as our base, and that are % change

38
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:45,282
in quantity supplied, that's % change in quantity supplied, that's this, this right over here

39
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:53,889
we went from 10 to 16, so we have +6 over base of midpoint between 10 and 16, is 13. 10 + 16 is 26, divided by two

40
00:02:53,889 --> 00:03:01,195
is 13. 6 over 13. Which is going to be something percent. We'll take calculator out, so

41
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:08,904
we have 6 divided by 13, get this 46 %. So this is, this right over here is 46%. So we have

42
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:16,569
when we had based on the way we have calculated, this 67%

43
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:25,195
increase in price we had 46% increase in quantity supplied.

44
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:31,538
So this is 46% increase in quantity supplied, it's all we can see about elasticity

45
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:37,358
of supply, it's goÃ­ng to be 46% over 67%, so it's going to be something less than 1.

46
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:47,685
We can get, so that's going to be that divided by 0,6666666... keeps going on forever, this is 0,69

47
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:55,586
So this is elasticity of supply 0,69, we've back see it approximatelly 0,69.

48
00:03:55,586 --> 00:04:03,738
we've tell this, we get a smaller percent at least this price point right over here, we get a smaller percent change in quantity

49
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:14,899
supplied than our percent change in price. Let's think about like me did with let me talk about we do about elasticities of demand, let's think about different scenarios

50
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:20,792
So let's think about, let's think about a scenario that is inelastic.

51
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:23,813
That is maybe perfectly inealastic. So let's say that price,

52
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:36,082
price and quantity. So let's take me for an example - I make videos, I love making videos, this is what I want spend my days doing

53
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:41,960
and I don't care about how much they pay me, or how little you pay me, I guess prepair to be enough

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,626
that would maybe and I spent little bit more time making videos.

55
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:54,349
What else just as soon that I don't completely, I you know what you pay me a penny pro video or 0 pro video or do you pay me a $1000 pro video

56
00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:03,690
I'm going to just make the same number videos every day. So this is the right over here videos, videos pro day on average and it's

57
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:10,744
and this is the price per video. And let's say no matter how much you pay - what do you pay me nothing or you pay me $1000.

58
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:17,761
I was going to produce on average, let's say 3 videos a day. So than you have this

59
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:21,698
right over here you have an perfectly inelastic

60
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:35,946
perfectly inelastic supply curve. Now you can have the other scenario, you can have the

61
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:44,696
when you are farmer, so let me do price and quantity. Now you can have the other scenario when you are farmer

62
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:51,895
and you can either do crop, aid cropy, maybe it's corn and wheat. And you can easily swap between the two

63
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:58,292
unless this is soon for simplicity cost you the exact the same to produce one or the other. So

64
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:10,616
in that situation so let's say that the price of wheat pearl, let's say we're using capable price units. So the price of wheat is for you know

65
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:20,629
adjusting 4 units in all of that, let's say is $10 I don't know for bushels or something like that. I like this simplyfy for the sink model right here but this

66
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:24,898
right over here we're thinking about corn. We're thinking about corn.

67
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:39,090
We're thinking about corn, and so if corn so let's say corn is right $10. We're bought it for right $10 I will produce, so them let me make this clear

68
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:48,392
So price of corn is $10 and the quantity of corn maybe I don't know produce, I produce 2000 bushels

69
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:55,239
I know these prices are away for what a real price for bushel of corn or wheat is the same thing

70
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,823
my quantity for wheat right here is 2000. Now

71
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:07,900
if the price of corn will go marginally up if the price of corn, so let me put this, so this is graph of corn. So this is $10

72
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,573
and this is 2000 bushels pro year of something, so let's say that we're right over there,

73
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:23,208
now if the price for corn goes marginally up, the price for corn goes up to even $10,5 per bushel

74
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:33,099
all cents awnished from wheat production to corn production, this is going to be zero and this is going to go to 4000

75
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:40,530
So then, whenever we go, just as 10, line, whenever we go all the way to 4000. And likewise if this price will go down

76
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:48,224
if this go down like 9,95, I will shift all my production to wheat and wouldn't produce any corn. And so there you see that we have the very

77
00:07:48,224 --> 00:08:02,693
the main curve is getting very flat and you can see based on very very small percent changes in prices, I have very large percent changes in quantity supplied.

78
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:13,689
So this right over here is approaching, this is approaching, approaching perfect elasticity,

79
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:20,291
huge changes in quantity supplied elasticity for small percent changes in price

80
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:26,756
Now, the cool thing about elasticity of supply is actually much easier to make a curve that has unit elasticity or even

81
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:34,242
it's easy if you have unit elasticity, but if you have unit elasticity the easy as curve I can draw

82
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:42,627
for unit elasticity is going look like this, much this is curve for unit elasticity, it will be curve looks like that

83
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:50,813
and the reason why it works in this case is upwards sloping as price increases so as quantity

84
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:55,695
increase for the supply curve so that any point here the 2 are going to be proportional

85
00:08:55,695 --> 00:09:01,814
So a given change in quantity and a given change in price they are going to represent the same percentages.

86
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:06,691
Because as price is increasing, what this is we have large price, or we have medium price, you have medium quantity

87
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:13,216
When you have a large price, you have large quantity.

88
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:19,267
So these steps are going to be the same percentage of I wonder you have small prices, you have small quantity.

89
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,267
It's much easier to construct a curve, a supply curve that has unit elasticity, than this is to construct a normal demand curve that has unit elasticity.
