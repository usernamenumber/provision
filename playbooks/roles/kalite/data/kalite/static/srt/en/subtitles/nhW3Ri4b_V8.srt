1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:02,134
In the last video we saw that

2
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:04,781
if Ben's shoe company's stock prices

3
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:08,669
are trading at $21.50 per share

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,051
and if Ben's shoe company has 10,000 shares,

5
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,023
and we saw that over here on the left....

6
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:16,867
If it had 10,000 shares,

7
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,169
and actually both of the shoe companies had 10,000 shares,

8
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,783
then the market is essentially

9
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:23,921
valuing the equity of Ben's shoe company

10
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:26,655
at $215,000,

11
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:28,344
even though the book value of the equity

12
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:30,647
was $135,000.

13
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:32,794
What I want to do in this video is think about

14
00:00:32,794 --> 00:00:34,063
what does that mean,

15
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,862
or how should we perceive

16
00:00:35,862 --> 00:00:39,439
the market's value of the assets of Ben's shoe company,

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,223
and then we can also think about Jason's shoe company.

18
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:43,929
So, remember,

19
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:50,623
assets are equal to liabilites plus shareholder's equity,

20
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:51,691
so if all of a sudden

21
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,147
the market value of the equity,

22
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:54,841
the market capitalization,

23
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:58,120
for Ben's shoe company is $215,000...

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,442
(That is the equity part right over here)

25
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,624
This is the equity...

26
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:05,279
And the only liability that Ben's shoe company had

27
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:08,560
was this $5,000 in accounts payable...

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,200
So let me show you that right over here...

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,141
He had this $5,000 dollars in accounts payable,

30
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,867
also depicted over there.

31
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,785
So the only liability is this $5,000.

32
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,795
So the liabilities plus the equity

33
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,261
in the case of Ben's company

34
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,828
is $215,000 plus $5,000,

35
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:30,744
so this piece right over here is $220,000.

36
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,928
Now, you might remember from previous videos

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,284
that the book value of the assets in Ben's company

38
00:01:36,284 --> 00:01:38,464
are only $140,000!

39
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:42,052
$20,000 of cash, $100,000 of inventory,

40
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:43,622
$20,000 of... this is not equity,

41
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:46,256
this is equipment I should call it.

42
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:50,457
This is equipment, $20,000 of equipment.

43
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,476
So the question is what makes up the gap here?

44
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,798
when we think about the market value of the equity.

45
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:56,829
Because remember,

46
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,688
this piece right here only adds up to $140,000!

47
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,906
But our total assets,

48
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:06,111
or the market's perception of the total assets of the company,

49
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:08,015
are essentially what it's willing to pay

50
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,148
for the equity plus the liabilities,

51
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:13,816
so the market is saying that Ben's assets,

52
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:18,266
the assets in that company are worth $220,000.

53
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,417
So what makes the difference?

54
00:02:20,417 --> 00:02:21,884
And even better, let's assume that

55
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:23,450
Ben has actually done a good job

56
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,534
of saying the market value of his inventory,

57
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,282
the market value of his equipment.

58
00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:29,142
Well, what the market is saying in this situation,

59
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:31,583
and this is actually what tends to happen

60
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,849
where the market value

61
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,823
or in general the market value of a company

62
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,433
tends to be higher than the book value,

63
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,584
is that the company is saying that

64
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:41,773
this company has some type of intangibles,

65
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:44,049
things that you really can't put a finger on,

66
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,789
or touch or feel or hold.

67
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,040
But it makes this company's assets,

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,640
or this company has more than just the sum of its parts.

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,079
There's more to this company

70
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,726
than just the equipments, the inventory and the cash.

71
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:59,374
It might be Ben's management expertise.

72
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:02,300
It might be a certain way they have of doing business.

73
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,972
It might be a certain location they have.

74
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,365
It might be their assortment.

75
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:06,433
Who knows what it has!

76
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:09,148
But the market is saying that the combination of this

77
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,388
plus all of the expertise

78
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,572
and how the business is organised

79
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,487
means that it actually has more assets

80
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,270
than are on the books.

81
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,972
And the same thing is true of Jason's company.

82
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:21,805
When they assign a $120,000 market cap there...

83
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:25,473
This is $120,000 in equity, market value of equity,

84
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:29,699
he has another $105,000 in liabilites.

85
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,625
So the market is valuing their equity plus liabilities

86
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,410
at 100 and... or $225,000.

87
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,573
Is that right?

88
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,240
120 + 100 + 5

89
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,208
So 225,000

90
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,343
So once again they're valuing all of the assets

91
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:47,160
at 225,000.

92
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,436
Because assets are equal to liabilites,

93
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:51,387
(these are the liabilities right here)

94
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:52,780
plus equity.

95
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,474
So once again they're saying there's something above and beyond

96
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:59,792
the $140,000 that makes this company special

97
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,464
And an interesting thing to think about,

98
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,786
and we'll address it in the next video is:

99
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,783
Which one is a better deal?

100
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:09,060
Considering that these companies are pretty, pretty similar.
