1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,433
In the US we don't directly vote for a president or a vice president.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,733
Instead we use something called the "Electoral College"

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,476
The Electoral College...

4
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,900
So, when you show up to vote on Election Day,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,408
and Election Day will happen on November of an election year

6
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,807
and it could happen as early as November 2nd

7
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,314
and it could happen as late as November 8th.

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,796
And it's going to be the Tuesday after the first Monday in the month.

9
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:31,208
So, it'll be November 2nd if the first Monday is November 1st,

10
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:35,155
and it'll be November 8th if the first Monday is November 7th.

11
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,406
And so you go on Election Day and you will see a ballot

12
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,937
that will have the presidential candidates, it'll have their parties there

13
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:42,667
and it'll have the vice presidental candidates

14
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,979
and you'll vote for one of them.

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:50,503
But in actuality, when you're voting for candidate A

16
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,640
and let's say candidate A is a democrat.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,124
You are not actually voting for candidate A,

18
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:59,025
you are actually voting for a slate of electors

19
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,322
who promised to vote for that candidate.

20
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,873
So electors for that candidate.

21
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:09,056
And it isn't, in most States,

22
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,156
proportional, based on what proportion of people

23
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,725
vote for one candidate or another.

24
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,581
It's in most of the States, except for Maine or Nebraska,

25
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:18,994
it is a winner takes all system, so what do I mean by that?

26
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:23,267
So, right here we have the break down of the Unites States

27
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,937
by state of how many electors each State gets.

28
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:28,561
And the number of Electors is essentially

29
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,372
the number of Congressmen that that state has.

30
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:33,275
For example: California has 2 Senators

31
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,668
Every state has 2 Senators

32
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:38,638
California has 2 Senators and 53 Congressmen

33
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:40,612
and for those of you who aren't familiar with it

34
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:42,516
Every state gets 2 senators and

35
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:46,417
the House of Representatives is dictated by population

36
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:50,457
California is a huge State, 2 Senators, 53 Representatives

37
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:56,471
you have Texas: 2 Senators and it has 32 Representatives

38
00:01:56,471 --> 00:02:01,347
you go to Lousiana: you have 2 Senators and you have 7 Representatives

39
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:06,084
So, the Electors per State is based on the total number of Congressmen

40
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,869
So the number of Senators plus the number of Representatives

41
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,632
That's what gives us 55 in California,

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,767
9 in Lousiana, 34 in Texas.

43
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:19,738
What is interesting here is it's a winner take all in every state,

44
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:23,074
except for Nebraska and Maine.

45
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:28,631
In every other state if I get 51% of the vote in Texas,

46
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:33,182
I get all 34 electoral votes in the Electoral College

47
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:37,687
If I get 51 or ever if I get 50.1%,

48
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:40,729
just a slight majority of the votes in California,

49
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:45,535
I will get all of the votes for California in the Electoral College,

50
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,193
and in general, or in actuallity,

51
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:51,860
the president is whoever gets the majority

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,467
of the electoral votes in the United States.

53
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,657
And right now that threshold is

54
00:02:56,657 --> 00:02:59,119
or that magic number, you could think of it that way

55
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:07,133
is 270 Electoral College votes.

56
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:13,004
If no candidate is able to hit this threshold of 270 Electoral College votes

57
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,419
than it'll go to the US Congress

58
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,045
And in the US Congress it's interesting

59
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:18,809
because it isn't one Congressman one vote

60
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,712
or actually I should say: The US House of Representatives.

61
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,800
It'll go to the US House of Representatives

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,729
and it won't be one Representative one vote

63
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,862
what will happen is the Representatives in each State will vote together

64
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:33,438
and each State will get only one vote.

65
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,269
So, in a tie breaker the big states really, really lose out

66
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,566
because in the tie breaker Texas will get only one vote

67
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,935
California will get one vote

68
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,071
and Alaska will get one vote

69
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,557
and Rhode Island will get one vote.

70
00:03:46,557 --> 00:03:50,481
So, Rhode Island will have just as much to say in a tie breaker

71
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,477
as California will over who will be president

72
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:55,915
and they'll just keep voting until someone gets

73
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:59,375
a simple majority of the votes by state.

74
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,070
Now, there's one other twist here.

75
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,400
It's that the District of Columbia

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,467
Washington DC right over here

77
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,526
in Congress gets no Representatives

78
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,791
they have no Senators and they have no Representatives

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
but they do get 3 electoral votes

80
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,605
when it comes to deciding who is going to be president.

81
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,019
Now you might already may be beging to have a sense here

82
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,875
that maybe this winner takes all system might lead to some distortions

83
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,081
and the biggest distortion of all is

84
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:27,006
you can imagine a candidate who wins

85
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:30,434
who wins the popular vote

86
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:35,574
and loses the election, or loses in the electoral college.

87
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:39,800
And you might be thinking well gee, how can that happen?

88
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,540
And the way to think about it is,

89
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,667
imagine someone, let's say someone gets

90
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,160
with the States that they win, they get huge majorities.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,800
So lets say there is a conservative candidate,

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,067
and he or she gets huge majorities in the States they win

93
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:57,200
80% in Texas, they get 80% in Mississippi,

94
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,933
they get 80% in Oklahoma.

95
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,463
They get huge majorities in the states that they win

96
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:05,226
and the state that they lose they barely lose.

97
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,409
And they barely lose those really big states.

98
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:12,076
So let's say in Florida that candidate, I should say,

99
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,468
gets 49% of the vote.

100
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:16,952
So they had a lot of votes in Florida but not

101
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:19,135
enough to win it, the other person let's say gets 51%

102
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,411
all 27 go to the other candidate.

103
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:25,869
Let's say the same thing happens in California,

104
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,725
that candidate got 49% of the vote,

105
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,000
the opponent, say, gets 51% of the vote.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,809
All 55 go to California, you get no credit for that 49%

107
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,479
you get no credit for that 49% in Florida.

108
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,753
So in this situation, this candidate might actually end up

109
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:43,075
with the majority barely losing the states they lose and

110
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:46,697
trouncing the other candidate in the states that they win

111
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:50,598
but despite that actually getting fewer Electoral College votes.

112
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:52,867
Now there's a few clarifications I want to make

113
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:56,000
especially ones that have confused me in the past.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,933
One of them is, because you have

115
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,267
the same number of Electoral College votes

116
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,391
as you have US Representatives plus Senators

117
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:07,409
there's kind of this feeling that maybe each

118
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,800
each district sends its own elector to the state capital

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,262
to decide who the president is

120
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:13,800
and it doesn't quite work that way.

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
So this right here is the panel of electors

122
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,744
for Louisiana in 2008, and you can see right over here

123
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:23,667
each of the parties have their own slate of electors

124
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,467
and these are either decided by the parties themselves

125
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,200
or they're decided by the candidates' teams

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,600
and even though you have someone here for each district

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
and then you have these at large canidates,

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,733
it's not like, let's take a situation,

129
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,400
and this actually happened in Louisiana,

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,733
where John McCain got a majority of the state

131
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:46,025
so John McCain and Sarah Palin got a majority of the state

132
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:49,867
it's not the case that, let's say, in the second district

133
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,333
which is New Orleans,

134
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,667
Let's say that the second district the majority of the people

135
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,400
actually voted for Barack Obama.

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,733
It is not the case that Kenneth Garret in 2008

137
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:01,837
would have been the chosen elector.

138
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:05,067
Actually, even though they divide things by district

139
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,600
and they have these at large candidates

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,469
it actually a state wide election.

141
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:11,933
So they don't look at who won each of the districts

142
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,533
they just say, "look John McCain and Sarah Palin

143
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,292
won the entire state."

144
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,733
So all of these electors

145
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,210
are the ones that are going to go

146
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,133
to the state capital in December

147
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:26,357
and decide who they want to plege their vote for

148
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:29,004
so even if Obama won

149
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,769
just the second congressional district

150
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,200
that's not how it's thought about in the electoral college,

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,533
it's just a state-wide election.

152
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,333
McCain got the majority of the state,

153
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,862
all of the electors will be chosen from McCain's slate

154
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,298
or from the republican party slate.

155
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,800
And then their gonna go to the state capital

156
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
in the case of Louisiana it would be the Baton Rouge

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,241
and they will decide who they want to plege their votes to.

158
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:52,667
And all of the electors in all of the states

159
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,246
go to their designated location,

160
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:56,785
usually the state Capitol, on the same day

161
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:59,533
and usually that is some day in December

162
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:00,477
and then they pick the president,

163
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,673
although by that point everyone know who the president is

164
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:05,088
because the actual election was in early November

165
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:07,671
and people know which way the votes went

166
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,661
and which way the electoral college votes went.

167
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:14,200
Now I did mention that there are two states

168
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,821
that don't do this winner take all,

169
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,200
Nebraska and Maine,

170
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,667
and in Nebraska and Maine

171
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,867
when you go vote it really is by congressional district

172
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,000
Nebraska has 3 congressional districts

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,754
so in those 3 congressional districts

174
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,519
if one of them goes to the democrat

175
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,680
and two of them goes republican

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,954
then they'll have 1 electoral vote for the democrat

177
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,600
and 2 for the republican.

178
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,282
And then they have two at large votes

179
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:35,933
that are decided the same way

180
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,600
the kind of the "winner takes all" basis

181
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,867
if you take 51% of the vote on a state wide basis

182
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,600
you get two at large votes.

183
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,006
Same thing for Maine,

184
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,733
but Maine has 2 congressional districts

185
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,400
so 2 of the congressional districts could go either way

186
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,933
and then the at large are based on a state-wide vote.

187
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,333
Now you could imagine the other kind of

188
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,133
unfair thing here other than the popular vote versus the

189
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,067
you know, the electoral college vote,

190
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,867
is it, you can imagine it makes some states

191
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,867
better represented than others.

192
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,948
So if you just divide population

193
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,733
by the number of electors,

194
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,667
you see the larger states each elector

195
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,667
is representing many, many more people,

196
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,000
this is California right here,

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,436
Each elector is representing over 600,000 people,

198
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,933
and in the smaller states,

199
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,400
this is Wyoming right here,

200
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,733
each elector is representing under 200,000 people.

201
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,867
So in Wyoming people are getting kind of

202
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,400
three times the representation

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,277
as they would in California on a per capita vote.

204
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:33,277
What makes it even a little bit more skewed

205
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,067
because it's "winner takes all"

206
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,333
and the candidates aren't silly

207
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,200
and they wanna make sure that they spend their money

208
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,267
and their visits and their time in the most leverageable way

209
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,067
it actually creates this weird scenario where

210
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:48,600
candidates will often ignore huge part of the population

211
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,267
and they ignore them because those huge parts of the population

212
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,800
are unlikely to swing either one way or the other.

213
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,400
So, for example, California is very reliably democratic

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,133
and Texas is very reliably republican.

215
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,067
So this right here, this is a fascinating graph

216
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,067
--at least in my mind--

217
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:11,667
it shows where George W Bush and John Kerry

218
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:15,702
spent the last 5 weeks of the 2004 election

219
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:16,933
--let me close that right there...--

220
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,667
of the 2004 election.

221
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,933
This top graph shows where they actually

222
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,600
spent their time so each these little hands here is a visit

223
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,067
in those final 5 weeks

224
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,400
and each of these dollar signs

225
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,333
is a million dollars spent on marketing and advertising

226
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,267
and on ads and whatever else in those states

227
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,343
and you can see California and Texas,

228
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:37,690
the two biggest states,

229
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,200
they didn't spend enough money to threshold

230
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,800
to get a dollar sign written there

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,267
so they didn't even spend a million dollars

232
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,400
on these huge states

233
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,067
they only had a few visits to California

234
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,600
and Texas,

235
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,733
Texas had no visits in the final five weeks

236
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,067
so what happens is that candidates spend

237
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,467
a disproportionate amount of attention and money

238
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,667
in the states that are more likely to swing

239
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,467
one way or another,

240
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,133
so the people in Florida, or in Ohio,

241
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,667
--this is all Ohio and Florida--

242
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:07,133
got a ton of more attention, especially on a per person basis

243
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,775
they the people in Texas did.
