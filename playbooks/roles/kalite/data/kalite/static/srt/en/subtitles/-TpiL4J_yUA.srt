1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:05,133
Simplify 3a times a to the fifth times a squared.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,933
So the exponent property we can use here is

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,733
if we have the same base, in this case it's a,

4
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,333
if we have it raised to the x power and we're

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,333
multiplying it by a to the y power,

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:21,667
then this is just going to be equal to a to the x plus y power,

7
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,575
and we'll think about why that works in a second,

8
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:26,000
so let's just apply it here, and let's start with

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,333
the a to the fifth times a squared. So if

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,067
we just apply this property over here, this will result

11
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:35,267
in a to the five plus (2nd) power.

12
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,200
so that's what those guys reduce to or simplify to

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,067
and of course we still have, we still have the

14
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,491
3a out front.

15
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:46,486
Now, what I want to do to take a little bit to the side

16
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:47,996
and realize why this works.

17
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:50,200
Let's think about a to the fifth times a squared

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,567
means. A to the fifth literally means

19
00:00:54,567 --> 00:01:00,000
a times a times a times a times a.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,319
Now, a squared literally means a times a.

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,133
And we're multiplying the two times each other.

22
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:11,800
So we're multiplying these five a's times these two a's,

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,966
so what have we just done?

24
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:15,333
We're multiplying a by itself five times, then

25
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:22,579
another two times, so let me make it clear

26
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,133
this over here is a to the fifth, this over here

27
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,165
is a squared, when you multiply the two

28
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:36,067
you're multiplying a by itself seven times! Five plus two!

29
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:40,067
So this is a to the seventh power. (A to the five plus two power.)

30
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:45,933
So this simplifies to 3a times a to the seventh power.

31
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:50,829
Now, you might say, how do I apply the property

32
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,179
over here? What is the exponent on the a?

33
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,400
And remember, if I just have an a over here,

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,817
this is equivalent to a to the first power.

35
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:02,533
So I can rewrite 3a as three times a to the first power

36
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:05,000
And now maybe it makes it a little bit more clearer

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,667
a to the first power, and the association property

38
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,867
of multiplication-- I can do the multiplication of

39
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:13,067
the a's first before I worry about the 3's!

40
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,733
So I can multiply these two guys first.

41
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:18,067
So a to the first times a to the seventh,

42
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:21,034
I just have to add the exponents cause I have the same base and I'm taking the product,

43
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:24,000
that's going to be a to the eighth power,

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,820
and I still have this three out front.

45
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,333
So, 3a times a to the fifth times a squared simplifies to

46
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,000
3a to the eighth power.
