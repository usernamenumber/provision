1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,090
Now that you've had a little
bit of exposure to what a

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,650
convolution is, I can
introduce you to the

4
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:14,900
convolution theorem, or at
least in the context of--

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,470
there may be other convolution
theorems-- but we're talking

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,050
about differential equations
and Laplace transforms. So

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,440
this is the convolution theorem
as applies to Laplace

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,400
transforms. And it tells us that
if I have a function f of

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,259
t-- and I can define its Laplace
transform as, let's

10
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,130
see, the Laplace transform of
f of t is capital F of s.

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,660
We've done that before.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,580
And if I have another function,
g of t, and I take

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:50,010
its Laplace transform, that of
course is capital G of s.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,220
Then if we were to convolute
these two functions, so if I

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,670
were to take f and I were to
convolute it with g, which is

16
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,990
going to be another function
of t-- and

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,040
we already saw this.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,970
We saw that in the last video.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,860
I convoluted sine and cosine.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,460
So this is going to be
a function of t.

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,350
That the Laplace transform of
this thing, and this the crux

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,770
of the theorem, the Laplace
transform of the convolution

23
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,860
of these two functions is equal
to the products of their

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,030
Laplace transforms. It equals
F of s, big capital F of s,

25
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,970
times big capital G of s.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,050
Now, this might seem very
abstract and very, you know,

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,170
hard to kind of handle
for you right now.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,830
So let's do an actual example.

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,260
And actually, even better, let's
do an inverse Laplace

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,870
transform with an example.

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,040
And actually, let me write
one more thing.

32
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,950
If this is true, then we could
also do it the other way.

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,580
We could also say that f-- and
I'll just do it all in yellow;

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,200
it takes me too much time to
keep switching colors-- that

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,800
the convolution of f and g, this
is just a function of t,

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,790
I can just say it's the inverse
Laplace transform.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,480
It's just the inverse Laplace
transform of F of

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,540
s times G of s.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,680
Although I couldn't resist it.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,930
Let me switch colors.

41
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,020
   

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,420
There you go.

43
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,570
Now, what good does
all of this do?

44
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,510
Well, we can take inverse
Laplace transforms. Let's just

45
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,760
say that I had-- let me write
it down here-- let's say I

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,080
told you that the following
expression or function, let's

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,430
say H of s-- let me write it
this way-- H of s is equal to

48
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,510
2s over s squared plus 1.

49
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,880
Now, we did this long
differential equations at the

50
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,880
end, we end up with this thing
and we have to take the

51
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,170
inverse Laplace transform
of it.

52
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,580
So we want to figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of H

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,960
of s, or the inverse Laplace
transform of

54
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,830
this thing right there.

55
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,090
So we want to figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of

56
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,285
this expression right here, 2s
over s squared plus 1 squared.

57
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,040
I don't want to lose that.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,170
Right there.

59
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,760
Now, can we write this as the
product of two Laplace

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,000
transforms that we do know?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,510
Let's try to do it.

62
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,790
So we can rewrite this.

63
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,965
And so this is the inverse
Laplace transform.

64
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,880
So let me rewrite this
expression down here.

65
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,920
So I can rewrite 2s over s
squared plus 1 squared.

66
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,180
This is the same thing as-- let
me write it this way-- 2

67
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:51,420
times 1 over s squared plus 1,
times s over s squared plus 1.

68
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,490
I just kind of broke it up.

69
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,590
If you multiply the numerators
here, you get 2 times

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,580
1, times s, or 2s.

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,200
If you multiply the denominators
here, s squared

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,920
plus 1, times s squared plus 1,
well, that's just s squared

73
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,130
plus 1 squared.

74
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,360
So this is the same thing.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,640
So if we want to take the
inverse Laplace transform of

76
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,530
this, it's the same thing as
taking the inverse Laplace

77
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,650
transform of this right here.

78
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,649
Now, something should
hopefully start

79
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,870
popping out at you.

80
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,360
If these were separate
transforms, if they were on

81
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,470
their own, we know
what this is.

82
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,380
If we call this F of s, if we
said this is the Laplace

83
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,230
transform of some function, we
know what that function is.

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,980
This is this piece right here.

85
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,020
I'm just doing a little
dotted line around it.

86
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,810
This is the Laplace transform
of sine of t.

87
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,890
And then if we draw a little
box around this one right

88
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,560
here, this is the Laplace
transform of

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,480
cosine of t, G of s.

90
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,110
So this is the Laplace transform
of sine of t, or we

91
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,510
could write that this implies
that f of t is

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,170
equal to sine of t.

93
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,600
You should recognize
that one by now.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,650
And this implies that g of t,
if we define this as the

95
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,650
Laplace transform of g, this
means that g of t is equal to

96
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,770
cosine of t.

97
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,170
And, of course, when you take
the inverse Laplace

98
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,150
transforms, you could
take the 2's out.

99
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,440
So now what can we say?

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,170
We can now say that the-- let
me write it this way-- the

101
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,110
inverse-- so actually, let
me write it this way.

102
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,890
Or, actually, a better thing to
do, instead of taking the 2

103
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,990
out, so I can leave it nice
and clean, we could, if we

104
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,220
were to draw a box around this
whole thing, and define this

105
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,470
whole thing as F of s, then F of
s is the Laplace transform

106
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,130
of 2 sine of t.

107
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,500
I just wanted to
include that 2.

108
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,620
I didn't want to leave that
out and confuse the issue.

109
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,150
I wanted a very pure F
of s times G of s.

110
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,430
So this expression right here is
the product of the Laplace

111
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,200
transform of 2 sine of t, and
the Laplace transform of

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,610
cosine of t.

113
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,400
Now, our convolution theorem
told us this right here.

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,510
That if we want to take the
inverse Laplace transform of

115
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,470
the Laplace transforms of two
functions-- I know that sounds

116
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,530
very confusing --but you just
kind of pattern match.

117
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,920
You say, OK look, this thing
that I had here, I could

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,690
rewrite it as a product
of two Laplace

119
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,460
transforms I can recognize.

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,670
This right here is the Laplace
transform of 2 sine of t.

121
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,050
This is the Laplace transform
of cosine of t.

122
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,180
And we just wrote that as
G of s, and F of s.

123
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,040
So if I have an expression
written like this, I can take

124
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,440
the inverse Laplace transform
and it'll be equal to the

125
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,220
convolution of the original
functions.

126
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,830
It'll be equal to the
convolution of the inverse of

127
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,630
g or the inverse of f.

128
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,750
Let me write it this way.

129
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,810
I could write it like this.

130
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:03,410
We know that f of t is equal
to the inverse Laplace

131
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,080
transform of F of s.

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,830
And we know that g-- I should
have done it in a different

133
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,520
color, but I'll do g in green--
we know that g of t is

134
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,190
equal to the inverse Laplace
transform of G of s.

135
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,450
So we can rewrite the
convolution theorem as the

136
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,960
inverse-- and this might maybe
confuse you more than help,

137
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,060
but I'll give my best shot.

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,550
The inverse Laplace transform
of-- and I'll try to stay true

139
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:43,480
to the colors-- of F of s times
G of s is equal to-- I'm

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,220
just restating this convolution

141
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,690
theorem right here.

142
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,910
This is equal to the convolution
of the inverse

143
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,340
Laplace transform of F of s.

144
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,680
So it's equal to the convolution
of the inverse

145
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,620
Laplace transform of F of s
with the inverse Laplace

146
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,480
transform of G of s.

147
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,380
With the inverse Laplace
transform of

148
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,410
capital G, of G of s.

149
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,740
I'm not sure if that helps you
or not, but if you go back to

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,160
this example it might.

151
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,260
This is F of s, this is
F of s right here.

152
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:28,130
2 times-- I'll do it in the
light blue-- this is 2 over s

153
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,320
squared plus 1.

154
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,460
That's F of s in our example.

155
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:39,820
And the G of s was s over
s squared plus 1.

156
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,590
And all I got that from is I
just broke this up into two

157
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,570
things that I recognize.

158
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,980
If I multiply this together, I
get back to my original thing

159
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,540
that I was trying to take the
inverse Laplace transform of.

160
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,930
And so the convolution theorem
just says that, OK, well, the

161
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,170
inverse Laplace transform of
this is equal to the inverse

162
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:05,090
Laplace transform of 2 over s
squared plus 1, convoluted

163
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:14,960
with the inverse Laplace
transform of our G of s, of s

164
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,430
over s squared plus 1.

165
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,430
And we know what these
things are.

166
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,900
I already told them to you, but
they should be somewhat

167
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,700
second nature now.

168
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,650
This is 2 times sine of t.

169
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,720
   

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,110
You take the Laplace transform
of sine of t, you get 1 over s

171
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,190
squared plus 1, and then you
multiply it by 2, you get the

172
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,260
2 up there.

173
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,870
And you're going to have to
convolute that with the

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,660
inverse Laplace transform
of this thing here.

175
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,580
And we already went over this.

176
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,900
This is cosine of t.

177
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,670
   

178
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,480
So our result so far--
let me be very clear.

179
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,130
It's always good to take a step
back and just think about

180
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,270
what we're doing, much less
why we're doing it.

181
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:00,960
But let's see, the inverse
Laplace transform of this

182
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,650
thing up in this top left
corner, 2s over s squared plus

183
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,220
1 squared, which before we did
what we're doing now was very

184
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,740
hard to figure out-- actually,
this would be a curly bracket

185
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,620
right here, but you get the
idea-- is equal to this.

186
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:30,710
It's equal to 2 sine of t,
convoluted with cosine of t.

187
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,830
And you're like, Sal, throughout
this whole process

188
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,990
I've already forgotten what
it means to convolute two

189
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,330
functions, so let's
convolute them.

190
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,570
And I'll just write the
definition, or the definition

191
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,310
we're using of the
convolution.

192
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,370
That f convoluted with
g-- it's going to be

193
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,040
a function of g.

194
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,350
I'll just write this
short-hand-- is equal to the

195
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,570
integral from 0 to t,
of f of t minus tau,

196
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,910
times g of tau, dtau.

197
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:03,280
So 2 sine of t convoluted with
cosine of t is equal to-- let

198
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,575
me do a neutral color-- the
integral from 0 to t, of 2

199
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:22,290
sine of t, minus tau, times
the cosine of tau, dtau.

200
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,800
Now if you watched the very last
video I made, I actually

201
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,515
solved this, or I solved a very
similar thing to this.

202
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:34,400
If we take the 2 out we get 2,
times the integral from 0 to

203
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:43,090
t, of sine of t minus tau,
times the cosine of tau.

204
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,950
I actually solved this in
the previous video.

205
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,490
This right here, this is the
convolution of sine of t and

206
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,170
cosine of t.

207
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:54,000
It's sine of t convoluted
with cosine of t.

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,870
And I show you in the previous
video, just watch that video,

209
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,490
where I introduce a convolution,
that this thing

210
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,870
right here is equal
to 1/2t sine of t.

211
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,460
Now, if this thing is equal to
1/2 t sine of t, and I have to

212
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,750
multiply it by 2, then we get,
our big result, that the

213
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:21,550
inverse Laplace transform of
2s over s squared plus 1

214
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:26,170
squared is equal to the
convolution of 2 sine of t

215
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,480
with cosine of t.

216
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,550
Which is just 2 times this thing
here, which is 2 times

217
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,650
1/2-- those cancel out-- so
it equals t sine of t.

218
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,470
And once you get the hang of
it, you won't have to go

219
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,820
through all of these steps.

220
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,760
But the key is to recognize that
this could be broken down

221
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,800
as the products of two Laplace
transforms that you recognize.

222
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,160
This could be broken down as
the product of two Laplace

223
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,840
transforms we recognized.

224
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,630
This is the Laplace transform
of 2 sine of t.

225
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,010
This was the Laplace transform
of cosine of t.

226
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,320
So the inverse Laplace transform
of our original

227
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,460
thing, or original expression,
is just the convolution of

228
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,760
that with that.

229
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,190
And if you watched the previous
video, you'd realize

230
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,160
that actually calculating that
convolution was no simple

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,890
task, but it can be done.

232
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,840
So you actually can get
an integral form.

233
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,200
Even if it can't be done, you
can get your answer, at least,

234
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,510
in terms of some integral.

235
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,920
So I haven't proven
the convolution

236
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,730
theorem to you just yet.

237
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,260
I'll do that in a
future video.

238
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,540
But hopefully, this gave you a
little bit of a sense of how

239
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,040
you can use it to actually
take inverse Laplace

240
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,840
transforms. And remember, the
reason why we're learning to

241
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,040
take inverse Laplace transforms,
and we have all of

242
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,280
these tools to do it, is because
that's always that

243
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,950
last step when you're solving
these differential equations,

244
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,490
using your Laplace transforms.

245
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:45,647
