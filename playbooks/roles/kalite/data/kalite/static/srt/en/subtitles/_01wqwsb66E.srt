1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,540
Find the greatest common factor of these monomials.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,015
Now the greatest common factor of anything

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:11,757
is the largest factor that's divisible into both --

4
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:13,540
if we're just talking about pure numbers:

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,938
into both numbers,

6
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:16,637
or in this case into both monomials.

7
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:18,420
Now we have to be a little bit careful

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,206
when we talk about 'greatest'

9
00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:22,937
in the context of algebraic expressions like this

10
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:25,022
because it's 'greatest' from the point of view that

11
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:27,203
it includes the most factors

12
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:29,869
for each of these monomials,

13
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:32,676
it's not necessarily the greatest possible number

14
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,205
because maybe some of these variables

15
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:36,756
can take on negative values;

16
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:38,840
maybe they are taking on values less than one

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,267
so if squared they actually become a smaller number

18
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,537
but I think,

19
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:44,272
without getting too much into the weeds there,

20
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:46,616
I think if we just kind of run through the process of it

21
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:48,520
you'll understand it a little bit better.

22
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,420
So to find the greatest common factor.

23
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,842
Let's just essentially break down

24
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:53,619
each of these numbers into

25
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,876
what we could call their prime factorization

26
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,175
but it's kind of a combination

27
00:00:57,175 --> 00:00:58,365
of the prime factorization

28
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,014
of the numeric parts of the number

29
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:02,837
plus essentially the factorization of the variable part.

30
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:04,607
So if we wanted to write 10,

31
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:08,143
or if we wanted to write 10cd^2

32
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:09,536
we can rewrite that

33
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,020
as the product of the prime factors of 10

34
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,937
- which is just 2 * 5 -

35
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:16,666
those are both prime numbers

36
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,466
So 10 can be broken down

37
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,270
as 2 times 5.

38
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,870
C can only be broken down by c.

39
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,085
We don't know anything else

40
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:26,200
that c can be broken into.

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,842
So 2 times 5 times c

42
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:31,271
But then the d^2 can be rewritten

43
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,453
as d times d.

44
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,213
This is what I mean

45
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:38,055
by writing this monomial

46
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,126
as the product of its constituants.

47
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:42,949
For the numeric part of it,

48
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,129
it's the constituants of the prime factors

49
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,656
and for the rest of it

50
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,790
we are just expanding out the exponents.

51
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,054
Now, let's do this for

52
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,653
25 c to the third, d squared.

53
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:55,279
So 25, that is 5 * 5.

54
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,390
So this is equal to 5 * 5.

55
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,534
And then c^3, that is

56
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:04,390
c times c times c.

57
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,790
And then d-squared,

58
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,444
that is d times d.

59
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,793
So what is their greatest common factor

60
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,876
in this context?

61
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:21,123
Well, they both have at least one 5,

62
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:26,395
and they both have at least one c

63
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:31,629
and then they both have two d's.

64
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:34,789
So the greatest common factor in this context

65
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,123
the greatest common factor

66
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,591
of these two monomials,

67
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,789
will be the factors that they have in common.

68
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,285
It will be equal to

69
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,624
this five, times

70
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,480
we only have one c in common,

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,371
times - we have two d's in common.

72
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,125
So this is equal to

73
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,876
5 times c times d-squared.

74
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:55,944
So 5 c d-squared

75
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,394
we can view as the greatest --

76
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,925
I'll put that in quotes,

77
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:00,279
you know, depending on whether c

78
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,395
is negative or positive -

79
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:02,701
and d is greater than

80
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,998
or less than zero.

81
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,623
But this is the "greatest" common factor

82
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:07,225
of these two monomials.

83
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,062
It's devisable into both of them

84
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,060
and it uses

85
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,583
the most factors possible.
