1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
   

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,580
And welcome back.

3
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:08,000
We are now on number
seven on page 409.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,790
Dwayne has a newspaper route
for which he collects k

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,040
dollars per day.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:21,370
   

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,400
From this amount, he pays out--
so this is how much he

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,180
makes-- k/3 dollars per day
for the cost of the paper.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,210
So this is cost of papers.

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,200
And he saves the rest
of the money.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,690
In terms of k, how many
days will it take

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,230
Dwayne to save $1,000?

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,290
That's his goal.

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,710
Well, how much does
he make per day?

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,650
Well, he makes k, and he has
to give out k/3 per day.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:06,370
So each day, per day, he
makes k minus k/3.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,060
We could write this
as 3k minus k/3.

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,200
   

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,790
k is the same thing is 3k/3.

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,225
So this is equal to 2k/3.

21
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,820
   

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,760
That's how much he
makes per day.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,760
So how much does he
make in d days?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,520
If d is the number of days,
how much does he make?

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,920
Well, he makes 2k/3 times d.

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,550
That's how much he makes,
right? d days.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,390
Well, he wants to make $1,000,
so how many days

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,640
is it going to take?

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,850
   

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,692
Hopefully, you realize this is
a level one linear equation,

31
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:57,210
so you multiply both sides
times a reciprocal.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,815
So 3/2k times this,
times 3/2k.

33
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:04,470
   

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,260
This cancels this.

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,840
This cancels.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,410
That cancels.

37
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,300
You're just left with a d
on the left-hand side.

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,509
And on the right-hand side, we
can do little canceling, too.

39
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,290
This 2 will cancel and
make this into 500.

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,620
You have 500 times 3/k.

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,040
So that equals-- I don't know
why I started tilting-- that

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:33,880
equals 1500/k days.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,830
And that is the choice
number D.

44
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,910
All right.

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,350
I get excited.

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,360
Number eight has
a number line.

47
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,030
I get excited whenever there's
a number line problem.

48
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,800
I don't know why.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,820
It's a psychological
disorder, perhaps.

50
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,740
But a good one.

51
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,260
Some abnormalities are positive
abnormalities.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,610
Let's see.

53
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,780
So let me draw this
number line.

54
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,680
   

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,320
All right.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,615
I drew that number line.

57
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:10,300
That's a number line.

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,370
Most of the time is probably
just going to take drawing it.

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,460
Let me do this in a
different color.

60
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,160
So I have point A.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,440
Let me do it in a more
vivid color.

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,250
Point A is here, and then it's
right next to negative 2.

63
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,240
It's a little bit less
than negative 2,

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,100
which is right there.

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,680
Then I have negative
1 right here.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Then I got a bunch of points.

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,740
I have B.

68
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,800
I have P.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,550
I have C.

70
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,680
Then I have 0.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,020
Then I have 1.

72
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,920
And then I have a couple
points more.

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,530
D.

74
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,970
And then I have Q.

75
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,760
Then I have the number
2, and I have E.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
All right.

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,660
So let's read the problem.

78
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,440
Which of the letter points, on
the number line above, could

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,790
represent the result when the
coordinate of point P is

80
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,880
multiplied by the coordinate
of point Q.

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,910
All right.

82
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,850
So this is pretty much just an
approximation problem, right?

83
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,950
So we're trying to figure out
P times Q, essentially.

84
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,940
So point P, well, let's eyeball
it, it's a little bit

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,670
to the left of 0, to the
right of negative 1.

86
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,320
It looks like maybe, I
don't know, I'm just

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,130
guessing, minus 0.5?

88
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,980
minus 1/2, right?

89
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,570
Minus 1/2.

90
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,170
And what's Q?

91
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:44,260
Well, Q looks a little bit
closer to 2 than it is to 1,

92
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,880
so I would say maybe,
1 and 3/4?

93
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,820
I'm just guessing.

94
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,470
You could just approximate
it as you want.

95
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,720
So 1 and 3/4.

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,690
   

97
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,550
Or if you wanted to write that
as an improper fraction, which

98
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,410
I prefer to deal with, 7/4.

99
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,610
I'm just eyeballing it.

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,760
Nothing fancy here.

101
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,540
So if P is minus 1/2, and this
number is 7/4, what happens

102
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,810
when you multiply the two?

103
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:21,020
So minus 1/2 times 7/4 is equal
to minus 7/8, right?

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,490
So minus 7/8, that's
almost minus 8/8.

105
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,800
Minus 8/8 would be here.

106
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,780
Minus 8/8 would be at negative
1, and so this is a little

107
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,305
less negative, so it's a
slightly larger number.

108
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:42,050
So minus 7/8 is going to be
someplace around this area.

109
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,090
Well, it's interesting that
I've bumped into a number

110
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,030
there while I was looking
in that area.

111
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,780
I bumped into point B.

112
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,050
And maybe my approximation
is wrong.

113
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,380
Maybe it could be point P.

114
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,020
But when I look at the
choices, P isn't a

115
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,530
choice, and only B is.

116
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:01,570
So B is what I would bubble in,
as what happens when you

117
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,120
multiply P times Q.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,190
And that was kind of fun,
because it's just pure

119
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,410
approximation.

120
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,990
And you kind of get something
that approaches the answer.

121
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,080
Well, it is the answer I guess.

122
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,550
Hopefully.

123
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,800
All right.

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560
   

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,060
I'm having too much fun,
absolutely too much fun.

126
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,830
OK.

127
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,720
Number nine.

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:37,220
If 5y plus 2x is equal to 23,
and x is equal to y plus 1,

129
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,120
what is the value of y?

130
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,140
What does y equal?

131
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,490
Well, this we could
do straight up

132
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,560
substitution to solve.

133
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,610
We have x is equal
to y plus 1.

134
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,130
Substitute.

135
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,030
Substitute for x.

136
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,670
So then we're left with
5y plus 2 times x.

137
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,910
For x, we substitute
this term.

138
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,290
2 times y plus 1
is equal to 23.

139
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,730
We just do algebra, or
even arithmetic.

140
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,750
5y plus-- distribute the 2--
2y plus 2 is equal to 23.

141
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,720
5y plus 2y is 7y, plus
2 is equal to 23.

142
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,260
Subtract 2 from both sides.

143
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,500
7y is equal to 21.

144
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,740
y is equal to 3.

145
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,850
This was just a question to see
if you even took Algebra

146
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,540
I, not to make you feel bad
if you don't remember.

147
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,500
People forget things.

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,600
But anyway, let's move on.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,960
Number 10.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,230
A company produced 300
appliances in the first week

151
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,430
of the month.

152
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,810
So this is number
10 we're doing.

153
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,160
Let me switch colors because
that mauve is too dark.

154
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,410
So week one.

155
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,240
   

156
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,540
Appliances.

157
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,580
Produced 500 in week one.

158
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,030
Because it received additional
machinery, its production

159
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,650
increased 50% from the first
week to the second week.

160
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,390
How many appliances did
the company produce

161
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,030
in the second week?

162
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,210
Well, I didn't even have to
make a table here, right?

163
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,830
So it improved 50%.

164
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,910
So plus 50%.

165
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,690
So it's important.

166
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,030
It improved 50% percent.

167
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,650
Week 2 isn't 50% percent of 500,
it's 50% more than 500.

168
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,630
So it's 500 plus 50% of 500.

169
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,760
What's 50% percent of 500?

170
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,370
Well, that's 250, right?

171
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,250
So it's 250 plus 500 is 750.

172
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,650
I was looking forward to
something more challenging.

173
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,190
Anyway, number 11.

174
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,480
Let's see if I have time to do
number 11 in this video.

175
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,090
You know what?

176
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,780
I only have one minute left.

177
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,610
I will do this in
the next video.

178
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,860
See you soon.

179
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,060
