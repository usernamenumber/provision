1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,910
Problem 47.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,960
Which graph represents the system of equations shown below?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,480
So each of these equations represents a line.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,080
So this is going to be a line, well,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,500
both of them have y-intercepts of plus 3.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,510
And this line has a slope of minus 1.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's see.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,700
We need a downward sloping thing

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,460
that intersects at positive 3.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,710
Actually, they're both going to intersect at positive 3.

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,080
So choice A, neither of them.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,780
Both of their y-intercepts are minus 3.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,620
We need to see a plus 3 here.

14
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,960
So it's not choice A.

15
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,750
In choice C, one of the lines intersects at positive 3,

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,050
but the other line intersects at minus 3.

17
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,400
And they also have the same slope,

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,420
and these guys obviously don't have the same slope.

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,040
So it's not going to be choice C.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,020
Choice B.

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,020
So I have two lines.

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,010
Both of them have a y-intercept of 3.

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,670
This looks good so far.

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,020
Both of them have y-intercepts of 3.

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,510
And then I have one line that has a positive slope of 1.

26
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,050
For every 1 I go over, I go up 1.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,020
And I have one that has a negative slope of 1.

28
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,030
When I move over 1, I go down 1.

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,370
This line right here is y is equal to x,

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,650
because I have a slope of 1.

31
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,380
1x plus 3.

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,040
3 is its y-intercept.

33
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,510
And this line right here is y is equal to--

34
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,850
its slope is minus 1.

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,490
You move to the right 1, you go down 1.

36
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,050
So minus 1x, or minus x, and its y-intercept is plus 3.

37
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,580
So our answer is B.

38
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,020
These are the two equations that we have up there.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,000
You can't see it yet.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,690
That we have right here.

41
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,440
Our answer is B.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,030
And D, both of these guys have the same slope,

43
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,440
so you can't have-- clearly it doesn't apply to

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,880
the two equations up there.

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,460
And they also have two different y-intercepts,

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,470
so it's definitely not choice D.

47
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,060
Problem 48.

48
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,560
Yoshi has exactly $1 in dimes, which is $0.10,

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,010
and nickels, $0.05.

50
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,610
If Yoshi has twice as many dimes as nickels,

51
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,050
how many nickels does she have?

52
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,590
So she has $1.

53
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,830
So let n equal the number of nickels,

54
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:29,210
and let d is equal to the number of the dimes.

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,050
So it says Yoshi has twice as many dimes as nickels.

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,870
So the dimes are twice as many as the number of nickels.

57
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,730
That's what this tells us.

58
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,010
Yoshi has twice as many dimes as nickels.

59
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,090
That translates into the dimes are 2 times the nickels.

60
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,070
And then we also know that she has $1.

61
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,010
So how do you get $1?

62
00:02:52,010 --> 00:03:00,800
Well, it's $0.10, so 0.1 times the number of dimes.

63
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:09,230
Plus 0.05 times the number of nickels is equal to $1.

64
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,670
Or maybe just so we can avoid decimals,

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,000
I could rewrite this statement right here, exactly $1.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,070
Instead of writing in dollars, I could write in cents.

67
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,210
I could write 10 cents times each dime,

68
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:28,050
plus 5 cents times each nickel is equal to 100 cents.

69
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,950
So if you compare this equation and this equation,

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,030
I just multiplied both sides by 100.

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,000
Here I'm dealing with cents-- $1 is 100 cents.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,040
Here I'm dealing with dollars.

73
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,010
A dime is 1/10 of a dollar.

74
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,450
A dime is 10 cents.

75
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,480
This one right here is probably a little bit

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,580
easier to deal with.

77
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,950
So what are they asking? How many nickels does she have?

78
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,870
So we want to solve for n,

79
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,050
we want to solve for nickels.

80
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,630
We have this piece of information right here.

81
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,660
The dimes are equal to 2 times the number of nickels.

82
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,130
And we have this right here.

83
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,270
So what we can do is substitute for d.

84
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,230
We can replace this d, and we know that d is equal to 2n.

85
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,840
So we could put 2n in the place of that.

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,000
So let me write it over here.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,090
So I have 10d plus 5n is equal to 100.

88
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,580
10 cents times my number of dimes plus 5 cents times

89
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,070
my number of nickels is equal to 100 cents.

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,920
And then my dimes is equal to 2n.

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,050
So 10 times 2n plus 5n is equal to 100.

92
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,060
10 times 2n is just 20n, plus 5n, is equal to 100.

93
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,470
And then we get 25n is equal to 100.

94
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,620
Divide both sides of this equation by 25,

95
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,040
and you get n is equal to 100 divided by 25 is 4.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,020
Yoshi has 4 nickels.

97
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,320
And if you want to know how many dimes,

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,660
you multiply it by 2.

99
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,030
She has 8 dimes.

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,780
So she has $0.80 in dimes and she has $0.20 in nickels,

101
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,130
4 times 5.

102
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,000
Problem 49.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,440
What are all the possible values of x such that 10 times

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,020
the absolute value of x is equal to 2.5?

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,480
So we can simplify this.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,560
So we have 10 times the absolute value of x

107
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,000
is equal to 2.5.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,630
Or if we divide both sides of this equation by 10,

109
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,560
we get-- let me do it in blue.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,910
We get the absolute value of x is equal to--

111
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,030
what's 2.5 divided by 10?

112
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,040
You might be able to just do it in your head.

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,930
You say, oh, you know, there's 4 quarters in $1,

114
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,040
or 25 times 4 is 100.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
But this is 25 divided by 10.

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,810
You multiply 2.5 times 4, you're going to get 10.

117
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,720
So you can say this is 1/4.

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,270
If that wasn't obvious to you,

119
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,470
you could actually do the division.

120
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,020
You can divide 10 into 2.5.

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,010
Maybe throw some 0's there.

122
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,300
Put the decimal there.

123
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,050
10 goes into 2 zero times.

124
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,010
0 times 10 is 0.

125
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,010
Bring down the 2.

126
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,030
2 minus 0 is 2.

127
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,070
Bring down the 5.

128
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,480
10 goes into 25 how many times?

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:20,060
10 goes into 25 two times.

130
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,090
2 times 10 is 20.

131
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,610
25 minus 20 is 5.

132
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,040
Bring down another 0.

133
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,030
10 goes into 50 exactly five times.

134
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,440
5 times 10 is 50.

135
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
Subtract, you get 0.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,910
So 10 goes into 2.5, 0.25 times,

137
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,430
which is the same thing as 1/4.

138
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,040
The absolute value of x is equal to 0.25.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,610
Now that tells us that x, what are the two values for x?

140
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,270
x could definitely be equal to 0.25,

141
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,830
because the absolute value of 0.25 is 0.25.

142
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,030
Or what other number,when I take its absolute value,is 0.25?

143
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,040
Well, it could be minus 0.25.

144
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,920
I take the absolute value of minus 0.25,

145
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
I also get 0.25.

146
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,540
So my two choices are 0.25 or minus 0.25,

147
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,530
and that is choice A right there.

148
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,090
And when we did this division,

149
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,690
I did it kind of a long and slow way.

150
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,480
And if you didn't recognize this as 1/4.

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,280
The other way to say it is when you divide by 10,

152
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
that's equivalent to moving your decimal 1 slot to the left.

153
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,290
So you could have just said, oh,

154
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,860
2.5 divided by 10 is equal to--

155
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,900
let's just move the decimal over to the left--

156
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,010
is equal to 0.25.

157
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,010
All of those would have been equivalent ways of doing it.

158
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,070
Problem 50.

159
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,440
Which of the following is equivalent to 1 minus 2x

160
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,760
is greater than 3 times x minus 2?

161
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,110
So let's solve this.

162
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,030
So we have 1 minus 2x is greater than 3 times x minus 2.

163
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,550
Or we get 1 minus 2x is greater than--

164
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,010
let's distribute our 3-- 3x minus 6.

165
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,060
3 times minus 2 is minus 6.

166
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,770
Now we can subtract 1 from both sides.

167
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,700
So we have a minus 1 plus here,

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,030
and we're going to subtract a 1 from that side.

169
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,710
The whole reason why I'm doing that is to cancel out

170
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,770
that 1 right there.

171
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,080
So this side, those cancel out,

172
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,200
so I'm just left with minus 2x is greater than 3x,

173
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,000
and then minus 6 minus 1 is minus 7.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And now here's the vaguely tricky part.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,030
No, actually, we're not at the vaguely tricky part yet.

176
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,010
Let's subtract 3x from both sides.

177
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,290
So we have minus 3x on that side,

178
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,370
and then minus 3x on that side.

179
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,590
And the whole reason why I'm doing that

180
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,630
is to cancel out this 3x.

181
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,270
So that these two guys obviously cancel out.

182
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,990
Now minus 3x plus minus 2x, which is minus 5x,

183
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,040
is greater than minus 7.

184
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,030
And now here's the vaguely tricky part.

185
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,070
We want to divide both sides by minus 5.

186
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,130
But when you have an inequality,

187
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,560
and you're dividing or multiplying both sides

188
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,030
by a negative number,

189
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,000
you need to switch the inequality.

190
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
So if we divide both sides by minus 5,

191
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,910
so I could multiply by a fraction,

192
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,200
minus 1/5 times minus 5x.

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,080
And then I'm going to have a minus 7 times minus 1/5.

194
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,060
I'm going to switch the inequality.

195
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,870
So it goes from greater than to less than.

196
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,930
And the whole reason why it's switched is

197
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,900
because I'm multiplying both sides,

198
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,000
or depending on how you do it,

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,050
dividing both sides by a negative number.

200
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,000
So then this becomes--I picked minus 1/5 so this cancels out

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,530
So this just becomes x is less than,

202
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,560
and then minus 7 times minus 1/5,

203
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,020
the negatives cancel out,

204
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,040
or a negative times a negative is a positive.

205
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,010
So you're left with 7/5.

206
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,030
So x is less than 7/5.

207
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,440
And it shows you that maybe you don't want to

208
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,790
go work out the whole problem.

209
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,770
Because right here,

210
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,500
they didn't expect me to figure out the whole problem,

211
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,510
so I just wasted a little bit of both of our time.

212
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,390
They just wanted us to go a couple of steps into it.

213
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,020
So what did they just do?

214
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,420
Well, they just wanted that first step,

215
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,010
where I distributed the 3.

216
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,040
3x minus 6.

217
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,550
So that's all they did here.

218
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,340
Because they didn't change the left-hand side anywhere,

219
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,020
they didn't change the inequality anywhere.

220
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,000
So all I have to do is pick choice C right there.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,990
But hopefully you learned a little bit about

222
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,950
inequalities as well.

223
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,430
I hate to waste your time like that,

224
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,380
but this was actually a fairly straightforward problem.

225
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,060
But actually,the very first step we did got us to the answer

226
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,580
So that teaches us both a lesson:

227
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,000
look at the choices before you proceed with the problem.

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,050
51.

229
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:49,030
Which equation represents the line on the graph below?

230
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,010
So we can look at this, we can just kind of eyeball it.

231
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,630
But sometime it's hard to eyeball it.

232
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,610
So what we want to do is look for some point,

233
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,030
my first intuition is to say, OK,

234
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,270
y is equal to mx plus b.

235
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,550
Let's look for the y-intercept and the slope.

236
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,150
But here the y-intercept,

237
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,020
it's not completely obvious where it is.

238
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Although it looks like it's at 1.5.

239
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,270
And we can actually verify that it's at 1.5,

240
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,350
because its slope, you can see right here.

241
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,580
If we start at 1, and if we go 2 to the right,

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,440
we go down by exactly 1.

243
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:32,070
So its slope, m, is equal to change in y over change in x.

244
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,840
When your change in x is positive 2,

245
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,040
your change in y is minus 1.

246
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,380
So your slope is minus 1/2.

247
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,030
So if you go back 1, you're going to go up 1/2.

248
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,020
Just like that.

249
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,320
So our y-intercept is 1.5.

250
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,190
It's right there.

251
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,070
It's equal to 1.5.

252
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,080
Just like that. I can verify that from the slope.

253
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,530
If I start at 2, and I go 1 to the right,

254
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,010
that means I'm going to go 1/2 down.

255
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,930
Because my slope is minus 1/2.

256
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,030
So we go 1/2 down, and that'll get me to 1.5.

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:15,650
So the equation of this line is y is equal to minus 1/2 x,

258
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,020
that's my slope, plus 1.5.

259
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,950
And that doesn't look like any of these choices here,

260
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,720
so we need to simplify this a little bit.

261
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,260
Well, the first thing we might want to do

262
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,630
is multiply both sides of this equation by 2.

263
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,650
So you get 2y is equal to 2 times minus 1/2 x,

264
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,030
is just minus x, and then 2 times 1.5 is 3.

265
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,190
Plus 3.

266
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,660
And then if we add x to both sides of this equation,

267
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,860
and I'm doing that to get rid of this minus x

268
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,470
on the right-hand side, we get x plus 2y is equal to 3.

269
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,950
And that is choice A right there,

270
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,380
which was completely equivalent to what we did up here.
