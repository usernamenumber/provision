1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:11,122
We've talked a good bit about how the Chinese government is printing yuan to buy foreign exchange to keep the yuan devalued.

2
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:15,673
What I want to do in this video is actually to look at the data to show I wasn't making all that stuff up.

3
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:23,382
This is actually data from the People's Bank of China. This is directly from their website.

4
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:28,305
Right over here this is 2010 money supply and this is 2009 money supply.

5
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:31,490
You can get any money supply any year you want from their site.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:38,615
What we can do is just look at what happened over 2010 from the same point in 2009 and 2010.

7
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:47,996
Let me take just November 2009 to November 2010. I'll look at their M1 money supply.

8
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:53,678
I am going from November to November, because we'll see it from some of the other charts that we actually have data there.

9
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,632
We don't have December to December for some other charts I am going to use in this video.

10
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:07,333
This just gives the general idea. If we go from November of 2009, the M1 money supply.... now this is in hundreds of million yuan.

11
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:14,908
There was 212,493 hundred million yuan. Let's try to convert this into numbers that make a little bit more sense.

12
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:28,604
You fast forward to November 2010. The M1 is 259,420 hundred million yuan. Let's get calculator out. Now actually make some sense of that.

13
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:41,634
So a year later, it said 259,420. From that let's subtract what it was before: 212,493.

14
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:47,299
The difference is 46,927. This is in hundred million yuan.

15
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:55,338
If you want it in million yuan, you want to multiply it by 100. I think this is pronounced as yuan or yuan. I am not a Chinese pronunciation expert.

16
00:01:55,338 --> 00:02:06,498
That gets us to 4....this is in millions of yuan. If you want it in billions, we can divide this by 1000. Let's divide this by 1000.

17
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:17,648
So it's roughly 4692 billions or 4.7 trillion yuan increase in their M1 money supply from November 2009 to November 2010.

18
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:28,441
Pretty dramatic increase. Just so you can put in scope of dollars. I'll use a rough approximation for the current exchange rate: 6.5 yuan per dollar.

19
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:34,459
So let me divide that by 6.5 to get a rough approximation for what that would be in dollars.

20
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:47,787
And we get 722 billion dollar expansion in the M1 money supply of China from November 2009 to November 2010.

21
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:56,405
In the next video, we will see how this compares with their actual increase in foreign exchange, actually foreign assets.

22
00:02:56,405 --> 00:03:02,964
And we can see how much of this would go buy things from other countries or buy foreign exchange from other countries,

23
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:07,153
and essentially to keep the Chinese yuan devalued.

24
00:03:07,153 --> 99:59:59,999
