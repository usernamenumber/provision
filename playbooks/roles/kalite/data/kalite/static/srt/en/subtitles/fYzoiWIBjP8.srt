1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,730
Let's say I have the
vector field v.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,920
The vector at any given point
is equal to minus-- or the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,570
magnitude of my x direction
is actually dependent on y.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,280
So where we are in the y
coordinate and the xy plane.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,385
Plus-- and then my magnitude
in the y direction

7
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,470
is dependent on x.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,690
   

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,920
Fair enough.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,210
So first, let's just
chuck through this, and

11
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,090
figure out it's curl.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,680
So the curl of v.

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,450
   

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,160
It is equal to our del
vector operator, cross v.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,780
Which is nothing but this.

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,200
And even though this looks like
a two dimensional vector field,

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,480
we actually have to take the
cross product in 3 dimensions.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,420
Because a curl is just like
torque, and when you-- like we

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,410
did the right hand rule when we
studied-- well, I hope you

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,750
watched some of the videos on
magnetism and torque-- but the

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,780
torque actually goes in a
direction that is perpendicular

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,060
to both of the vectors
in your cross product.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,550
If both of these only have x
and y components, your actual

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,640
result is going to be
in the z direction.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,210
It's going to be perpendicular
to both of these vectors.

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,750
So when you take the cross
product, you still have to

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,730
do it in 3 dimensions.

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:31,660
So i j k, partial with respect
to x, partial with respect to

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,400
y, partial with respect to z.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,690
The x component is minus y.

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,500
The j component is x.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,920
And we have no k component.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,110
This one should be a little
bit cleaner to calculate

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,370
than the last example.

35
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,150
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, see the i

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,195
component-- let's cross out
its column and its row.

37
00:01:53,195 --> 00:02:00,180
So it's going to be the partial
with respect to y of 0

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,980
minus the partial with
respect to z of x.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,030
Minus that.

40
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,140
And all of that times i
minus-- and now it's going

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,870
to be the j component.

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,180
Remember, you do
plus minus plus.

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,960
So minus and this is
the j component.

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Cross out its row and column,
the partial derivative

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,300
of x with respect to 0.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,550
Or partial derivative of 0
with respect to x, actually.

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,450
Minus the partial
derivative of z.

48
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,840
Or the partial derivative
of the [? vector ?]

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,540
z of minus y.

50
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,860
That's its j component.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,820
And finally, plus
its k component.

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,630
Row and column.

53
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:50,740
So the partial derivative with
respect to x minus the partial

54
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,280
derivative of y with
respect to minus y.

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
And I know you can't read it,
but that's that minus y there,

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,900
and that's the k component.

57
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,990
And now let's simplify it.

58
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,810
I'll simplify it above it.

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,220
So this term-- let's see,
partial derivative of 0.

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,950
Well, that's 0.

61
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,360
Partial derivative of
x with respect to z.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,310
Well, as far as z's concerned,
x is a constant, so that's 0.

63
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,280
Partial derivative of 0
with respect to x, 0.

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,550
Partial derivative of minus
y with respect to z.

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,740
As far as z's concerned,
y is also constant.

66
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,010
So that's 0.

67
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,530
So all we're left is
with this last term.

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,270
That was pretty
straightforward.

69
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,320
Why don't we just cross
all of that out?

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,420
And that makes intuitive
sense, too, right?

71
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,000
Because at least from x's point
of view, the rotation is--

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,990
although, the rotation, if you
think about it, is going to be

73
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:47,080
in the direction perpendicular
to both the x direction and

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,380
perpendicular to the direction
in which it is changing.

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,370
You could kind of view it
orthogonally, to its direction

76
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,650
of motion, which is y.

77
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,310
So it would be the z direction.

78
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,860
If that confuses you,
don't worry about it.

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,420
But if it doesn't, then
you could apply the same

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,350
argument to the j vector.

81
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,270
But anyway, lets simplify this.

82
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,890
So this is equal to the
partial derivative of

83
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,280
x with respect to x.

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,510
Well, that's just 1.

85
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,270
Minus the partial derivative
of y-- of minus y

86
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,130
with respect to y.

87
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,750
Well, that's just minus 1.

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,560
So it equals 2.

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,330
So the curl, at any point of
this vector field, is 2.

90
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,380
Let's see what this vector
field looks like, and let's

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,590
see if that gives us-- if
our intuition holds

92
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,610
in this example.

93
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,360
And let me try to make
it a little bit bigger.

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,650
Make the window bigger.

95
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,510
There you go.

96
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,150
Well, I think it's clear, you
know, right when you look at

97
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,010
it, that this vector field
looks like it's spinning.

98
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,760
If you were to stick something,
especially in the middle, it's

99
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,450
very clear that it would spin.

100
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,450
But what might be a little
unintuitive-- you might think,

101
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,870
wow, well, wouldn't something
spin faster near the center

102
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,280
than it would here?

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,660
Why is the-- you know,
the curl we got is 2.

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,450
It's a constant.

105
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,150
The curl is the same throughout
this entire vector field.

106
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,680
So you'll be like, whoa, that's
kind of implying that the field

107
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,440
is making something spin
equally, no matter where

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,210
you are in the field.

109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,950
Let's see if that makes sense.

110
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,730
Well, in the middle, it
definitely makes sense that

111
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,970
something is spinning.

112
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,360
If I had a little stick here,
I'd be pushing in this

113
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,890
direction, with not that much
of a magnitude in

114
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,790
that direction.

115
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,720
And then I'd be pushing down to
the right in this direction,

116
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,570
so it would cause it to spin.

117
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,900
But what if I had that
same stick here?

118
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,810
You'd say, well, on the
top right I'm pushing

119
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,020
up, up and to the left.

120
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,180
And the bottom left, I'm also
pushing up and to the left.

121
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,270
You know, it wouldn't
spin as much.

122
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,880
But it would.

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,390
Because the difference in
magnitudes of these 2-- you

124
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,530
could almost view them as the
torque producing forces-- the

125
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,390
difference in magnitude is
enough that you'd still have

126
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,030
the same counterclockwise
rotation here as you

127
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,800
would have here.

128
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,110
So because the curl is a
constant positive number, when

129
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,410
we look at the xy plane like
this, if you put a twig-- that

130
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,390
same twig anywhere where you
put it on this plane--

131
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,370
it'll have the same
counterclockwise rotation.

132
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,370
I think that's pretty neat.

133
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,150
Now let's do a
little experiment.

134
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,600
What would have happened
if this was plus y.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,900
So let's just do
that experiment.

136
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:29,930
If this was plus y then this
would have been plus y, then

137
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,060
this final term-- we would have
taken the partial derivative

138
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,110
with respect to y of plus y--
and so this would have

139
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,260
been 1 minus plus 1.

140
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,050
And then our curl
would have been 0.

141
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,710
Which would have meant that we
would have had no rotation.

142
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,030
And what's the
intuition of that?

143
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,070
Well, if we just look at it
mathematically, if we have 0

144
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,770
curl, somehow, the rotation in
our x direction must be being

145
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,230
offset by a rotation
in the y direction.

146
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,290
That the torques must
be just perfectly

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,210
offsetting each other.

148
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,350
Let's see what happens
if I were to change.

149
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,740
So this was our old graph.

150
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,000
Let me actually change it
to my new vector field.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,310
   

152
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,160
So that's our new vector field.

153
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,700
This is our vector
field plus yi plus xj.

154
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,890
And now the curl
is 0 everywhere.

155
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,540
Which implies, or which means,
that I could put a twig

156
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,310
anywhere here and I'm not going
to get any kind of rotation.

157
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,160
Let's see if that makes sense.

158
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,070
If I put a twig in the center,
or some kind of stick in

159
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,740
the center, let's see.

160
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,330
I would have the forces or the
fluids pushing in in this

161
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,860
direction, but they're not
helping to rotate, and pushing

162
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,280
out in that direction.

163
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,870
Well, that's not going
to help me either.

164
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,110
So I'm definitely not
going to rotate there.

165
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,070
And actually, you could
put a twig anywhere.

166
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,240
And maybe a twig might be
pushed in a direction.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,520
For example, if I put a twig
here, it's going to be pushed

168
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,450
outward by the flow of the
water, by the velocity

169
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,350
of the water.

170
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,920
But it's not going to rotate.

171
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
So the [? ink ?]

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,230
kind of holds.

173
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,740
That's even though I kind of
have curl in the x direction,

174
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,300
or I have curl in the
y direction, they're

175
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,590
offsetting each other.

176
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,720
So that in 2 dimensions,
I actually end up

177
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,990
having no rotation.

178
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,070
And actually, this is called an
irrotational-- I think that's

179
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,410
the word-- vector field.

180
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,510
Where you're not going to
have any rotation here.

181
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,520
All of the-- if you think of it
as force or velocity of the

182
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,350
vector field-- is going to be
applying translation to

183
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,870
objects in that field.

184
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,520
And actually, just for fun,
let's think about the

185
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,630
divergence of that field.

186
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,900
Just to, I don't know.

187
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,250
Just because I have 2 minutes.

188
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,180
So if I were to think about the
divergence of that field, it's

189
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,340
fairly easy to calculate.

190
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,920
Let me erase this real fast.

191
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,240
It's always fun to just
interpret a vector

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,400
field to death.

193
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,320
Let's do the divergence
of this one.

194
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,000
So the divergence of that
vector field, is just a

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,210
partial derivative of
this with respect to x.

196
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:58,350
So div of v is the same thing
as our del operator dot

197
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,230
our vector field, v.

198
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,810
And that's the partial
derivative of this

199
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,260
with respect to x.

200
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,290
Well, the partial derivative of
y with respect to x is just 0.

201
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,140
Plus the partial derivative
of x with respect to y.

202
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,860
So this is 0.

203
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,520
So the divergence of
this field is 0.

204
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,430
And even in the other case,
when this was a minus, it

205
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,240
still would have been 0.

206
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,590
And does that make sense?

207
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,110
Well, if we take a circle
anywhere here-- let's take it

208
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,050
in the center, because the
center's the most interesting.

209
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,300
Let's take a circle.

210
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,690
So we do have some fluid or
particles coming in at a

211
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,940
certain velocity from the
bottom right and the top left.

212
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,410
But just as much is coming
out through the top right

213
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,100
and the bottom left.

214
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,650
Whatever's coming in through
here and here is leaving

215
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,490
through there and there.

216
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,330
So if I had an infinitesimally
small circle, or sphere, in

217
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,650
this vector field, I would have
no net density increasing.

218
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,500
Or nothing would be entering
into that circle, or in any

219
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,880
given amount of time the
concentration of that

220
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,060
circle wouldn't change.

221
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,660
And that's true pretty
much anywhere.

222
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,060
If I were to draw a circle
here, because the divergence

223
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,630
is 0, it's telling us that
whatever's coming in in 1

224
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,060
direction is coming out
in the other directions.

225
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,540
So I'm not getting any
denser, or any less dense.

226
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,080
I have no divergence
or convergence.

227
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,040
So that's just interesting.

228
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,120
Well, now I've run of time.

229
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,150
So we're done analyzing
this vector field.

230
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,300
See you in the next video.

231
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,900
