1
00:00:00,478 --> 00:00:01,938
In the late 1950s,

2
00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,440
William Phillips noticed a correlation

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,348
between unemployment and inflation

4
00:00:07,348 --> 00:00:09,604
and I have a picture of this gentleman right over here,

5
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:10,746
Irving Fisher

6
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:13,681
because he actually noticed that relationship a few decades before

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,771
but the relationship has taken on Phillips's name really because

8
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:21,272
his publication kind of captured people's imagination

9
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:24,520
and the relationship is not that surprising

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,271
it seems to fall a little bit out of common sense

11
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:30,770
but we'll talk about examples that seem to go against this relationship

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,012
If I were to plot the unemployment percentage right here

13
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,211
on my horizontal axis

14
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:45,349
and I plot inflation on my vertical axis,

15
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:51,347
so let me put inflation here

16
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:53,937
Then he noticed, (and I'm just gonna pick random data points)

17
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:59,081
but in one year where there was high inflation, there was low unemployment

18
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:00,346
and then in another year,

19
00:01:00,346 --> 00:01:03,015
where there was high unemployment, there was low inflation

20
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:05,185
and it's not clear which one's causing which

21
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:07,210
or maybe they both circle back on each other

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,475
and then in other years, maybe where you had medium inflation

23
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:15,208
or relatively low unemployment

24
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,184
so he looked at a bunch of years and plotted them on an axis like this

25
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,934
(let me do them all in the same color)

26
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,099
so you take a bunch of years

27
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:22,935
and you plot them here

28
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:28,747
so now you have higher inflation, slightly higher unemployment than that year over there

29
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:32,209
and I could just keep plotting some points over here

30
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,934
you could have deflation

31
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,476
and what he saw is that there's a correlation here

32
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,850
that there's an inverse relationship

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,681
that if you were trying to fit a curve to these points

34
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:44,270
and you could have more points here, I'm just picking them at random,

35
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:50,407
you could fit a curve that looks something like this

36
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:54,676
generally saying, when you have high inflation,

37
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:59,075
so when you're up here, you have high inflation

38
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:10,157
and low unemployment

39
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:11,943
the low unemployment part is a good thing

40
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:22,835
and now here you have low inflation and high unemployment

41
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:29,241
and if this curve goes below the horizontal axis you would actually have deflation

42
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,074
and it makes reasonable sense

43
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:35,405
we've kind of talked bout it in common sense terms before

44
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,405
but you can imagine - once again, it's not clear which one's causing which -

45
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,943
but you can imagine a world, just reasoning through it,

46
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:46,624
that if you have low unemployment, or you could view that as high employment,

47
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:55,217
one way to view low unemployment is that you have a high utilisation of the labour market

48
00:02:55,217 --> 00:03:05,482
well, now, in this situation, workers have more leverage

49
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:07,274
and if workers have more leverage

50
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:12,738
then employers will have to increase wages

51
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,276
to attract and retain employees

52
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:18,034
they have more leverage and they have more options

53
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,905
there are a lot of people looking to hire them

54
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:36,403
employers raise wages to attract and retain employees

55
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:41,570
but of course when you increase wages you're increasing buying power, generally for workers

56
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:51,677
so this is increasing workers' buying power

57
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:54,402
which would increase their demand

58
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,815
for goods and services

59
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:02,009
and if they're increasing the demand for goods and services,

60
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,070
they're going to increase the utilisation of all of the factors of production:

61
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,276
of land, of capital, of entrepreneurship,

62
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:14,234
and of labour, so that's going to lower unemployment even more

63
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,735
and you can imagine if you already have low unemployment,

64
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,481
and this is just one of the factors of production,

65
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:23,029
but if you think about all factors of productions, they are probably all highly utilised

66
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,568
the factories are running at close to full capacity

67
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:28,342
the labour market is running at full capacity

68
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:33,215
if you increase buying power, if you increase demand in that context,

69
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:35,068
so demand is going up

70
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:41,276
lower unemployment, labour utilisation is going down

71
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:43,067
there's less capacity, more demand

72
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,816
this is going to cause prices to go up

73
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:52,149
so this is going to cause prices generally to go up

74
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:57,609
and then if prices go up, now workers have leverage and options of employment

75
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:02,942
but they also have higher cost

76
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:06,903
higher cost of living

77
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:09,149
and this is a very kind of hand, wavy diagram,

78
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,546
but it's just to make you think about the overall dynamics

79
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,009
so workers have more options and leverage

80
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,482
they also have a higher cost of living,

81
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:20,148
the whole economy is kind of operating at close to full tilt

82
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:23,093
and so they're going to demand higher wages even more

83
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:26,076
and then this thing can keep cycling and keep cycling

84
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,215
now, this seems a bit common sense,

85
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,481
but there are exceptions to these

86
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,275
in the 1970s, the US experienced stagflation

87
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:39,481
and that's kind of the worst: that's high inflation and high unemployment

88
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,730
so that is right over here

89
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,147
and things that could cause it

90
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,980
and particularly what people point to in the 1970s,

91
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,761
and it's always important to realise that in economics people don't know for sure what was the exact cause

92
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,147
and there seldom is only one cause

93
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,480
but one of the things that's often pointed to

94
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,753
is that you had a supply shock

95
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:04,000
and the supply shock was in oil

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,145
it made the cost of producing everything more expensive

97
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,343
and so that just drove the prices up

98
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:15,145
but really didn't allow the country as a whole to become more productive

99
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:18,730
one way to think about it is it drove the prices up here

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,395
causing a higher cost of living right over here

101
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:28,076
but this part of this cycle that we associate with low unemployment and high inflation

102
00:06:28,076 --> 00:06:32,119
was not occurring

103
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,811
and because those higher prices were essentially going out of the country,

104
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:43,895
you could essentially imagine that they were squeezing out people's ability to pay for other things

105
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,676
so the higher cost of living

106
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,228
or the higher prices for oil

107
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:51,359
you could draw a line from either one and I know it's getting messy now

108
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:56,977
you can imagine that it inhibited demand for domestic production

109
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,565
so I'll draw "negative feedback" right over there

110
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:03,310
so it squeezed out people's desire to buy things because they had to pay so much for oil

111
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,643
and there's other explanations for it

112
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:09,977
when people saw the low unemployment, the government wanted to print even more money

113
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:15,393
to fuel things, but it did not get this virtual cycle happening

114
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,245
there were some arguments that there were structural reasons

115
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:21,677
why the economy couldn't adapt properly

116
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:26,087
so that employees and resources couldn't be allocated efficiently

117
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:31,308
but the whole point of bringing up the 1970s is to show you that this isn't a law

118
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,476
it's not clear what's causing what

119
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:37,582
that there was a situation in the 1970s where you had stagflation

120
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:42,476
and the opposite of that was what we really saw in the late 90s

121
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:48,011
where you had relatively low inflation and you had relatively low unemployment

122
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:51,142
so this is a very good situation that we had in the late 90s

123
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:54,808
and the argument that many pople make why we were able to do that,

124
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,742
why this cycle didn't keep going on and on

125
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:04,226
why the prices didn't go up is that you had this other trend of huge technological improvement

126
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:12,141
you had computers, and telecommunications, the Internet, this kind of super proactivity curve

127
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:18,678
so even though you had the cycle, you had increased buying power, demand was going up,

128
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,610
the proactivity of the country was increasing so much

129
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,389
that it did not lead to inflation

130
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,474
so that's what threw us there in the late 90s

131
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,550
so, in general, it's a neat thing to think about,

132
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,056
at least to some degree it seems like common sense,

133
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:38,342
but like in all things in economics, it's always a little bit more nuanced and complicated

134
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:42,557
than just some little correlation that you might observe

135
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:46,557
this could be generally true but there's always going to be exceptions to it
