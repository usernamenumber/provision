1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,151
Is the system of linear equations below

2
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:06,313
dependent or independent, and they gave us

3
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:07,575
two equations right here.

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,677
Before I tackle this specific problem,

5
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,812
let's just do a little bit of review of what

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,025
dependent or independent means.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,629
And actually, I'll compare that to

8
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,860
consistent and inconsistent.

9
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,538
So, just to start off with, if we're dealing

10
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:21,906
with systems of linear equations in two dimensions,

11
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,767
there's only three possibilities

12
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,427
that the lines, or the equations,

13
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,564
can have relative to each other. So let me

14
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,015
draw the three possibilities. Let me draw

15
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:35,032
three coordinate axes. So that's my first x-axis

16
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:37,964
and y-axis, so x and y. Let me draw another

17
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:44,918
one. And that is x, and that is y. Let me draw

18
00:00:44,918 --> 00:00:47,169
one more, because there's only three possibilities

19
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:50,323
in two dimensions, x and y, if we're dealing with

20
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:54,933
linear equations, x and y. So you can have

21
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:58,215
the situation where the lines just intersect in

22
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:03,231
one point, so you can have one line like that,

23
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,938
and maybe the other line does something

24
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:08,378
like that, and they intersect at one point.

25
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,350
You could have the situation where the two

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,477
lines are parallel. So you could have the situation

27
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:15,923
actually let me draw it over here, where

28
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,815
you have one line that goes like that, and

29
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,605
the other line has the same slope, but

30
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:21,421
it's shifted, it has a different y-intercept,

31
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,733
so maybe it looks like this, and you have no points

32
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:26,021
of intersection. And then you could have the

33
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,554
situation where they're actually the same line,

34
00:01:29,554 --> 00:01:31,513
so that both lines have the same slope

35
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,420
and the same y-intercept. So really, they are

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,005
the same line, they intersect on infinite number

37
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:39,900
of points. Every point on either of those lines

38
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,718
is also a point on the other line. So just to give

39
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:45,431
you a little bit of the terminology here, and

40
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:49,175
we learned this in the last video, this type of

41
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,159
system, where they don't intersect,

42
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,467
where you have no solutions, this is an

43
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:59,429
inconsistent system.

44
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,329
And by definition, or I guess just taking the

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,154
opposite of inconsistent, both of these

46
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:06,082
would be considered consistent. Both of these

47
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:08,467
are consistent.

48
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,344
But then, within consistent, there's obviously

49
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,498
a difference, here we only have one

50
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,092
solution, these are two different lines

51
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,985
that intersect at one place. And here,

52
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:19,082
they're essentially the same exact line.

53
00:02:19,082 --> 00:02:20,975
And so we differentiate between these two

54
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,314
scenarios by calling this one over here

55
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:32,340
independent, and this one over here dependent.

56
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,719
So independent, both lines are doing their own

57
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,298
thing, they're not dependent on each other,

58
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,323
they're not the same line. They will intersect

59
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:41,226
at one place. Dependent, they're

60
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:43,436
the exact same line, any point that satisfies

61
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:44,964
one line will satisfy the other.

62
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,262
Any point that satisfies one equation,

63
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:49,738
will satisfy the other. So with that said,

64
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:53,679
let's see if this system of linear equations

65
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,759
right here is dependent or independent.

66
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,329
So they're kinda having us assume that

67
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,862
it's going to be consistent. That we're either

68
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,898
going to intersect at one place, or we're

69
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:02,218
going to intersect at an infinite number

70
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:05,067
of places. And the easiest way to do this,

71
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,800
we already have this second equation here,

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,693
it's already in slope-intercept form,

73
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:13,432
we know the slope is -2, the y-intercept is 8.

74
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:17,138
Let's put this first equation up here in

75
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:18,525
slope-intercept form and see if it has

76
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,425
a different slope or a different intercept,

77
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:22,569
or maybe it's the same line. So we have

78
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,419
4x plus 2y is equal to 16.

79
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,723
We can subtract 4x from both sides,

80
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,513
what we want to do is isolate the y on the

81
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:35,082
left hand side. So let's subtract 4x from

82
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,051
both sides. The left hand side we are

83
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,759
just left with a 2y, and then the right hand side,

84
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,918
we have a -4x plus 16. I

85
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,107
just wrote the -4 in front of the 16

86
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,941
just so that we have it in the traditional

87
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:52,021
slope-intercept form. And now we can

88
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,144
divide both sides of this equation by 2,

89
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,759
so that we can isolate the y on the left-hand side.

90
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,733
Divide both sides by 2, we are left with

91
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:04,334
y is equal to -4 divided by 2 is -2x

92
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:08,269
plus 16 over 2, plus 8. So all I did is

93
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,717
algebraically manipulated this top equation

94
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,997
up here, and when I did that, when I solved

95
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:16,185
essentially for y, I got this right over here,

96
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,882
which is the exact same thing as the

97
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,400
second equation. We have the exact same

98
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,667
slope, -2, -2, and we have the exact

99
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,139
same y-intercept, 8 and 8. If I were

100
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,713
to graph these equations, that's my

101
00:04:31,713 --> 00:04:36,308
x axis, and that is my y-axis,

102
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:39,641
both of them have a y-intercept at 8

103
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,179
and have a slope of -2.

104
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:43,087
So they look something, I'm just drawing

105
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:44,518
an approximation of it, but they would look

106
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,359
something like that. So maybe this is the graph of

107
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:51,215
this equation right here, this first equation.

108
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:52,596
And then the second equation will be

109
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,390
the exact same graph, it has the exact

110
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,944
same y-intercept and the exact same slope.

111
00:04:56,944 --> 00:05:00,740
So clearly these two lines are dependent.

112
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,708
Dependent. They have an infinite number

113
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,354
of points that are common to both of them

114
00:05:06,354 --> 99:59:59,999
because they're the same line.
