1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:06,378
Rewrite the following expressions as the product of positive exponents, and then evaluate the expression

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:08,661
when x is equal to 2

3
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,409
So let's do this first part

4
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,427
They want us to rewrite it as the product of positive

5
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:14,645
exponents, so they don't like the fact that we have this

6
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:18,177
negative third power and the 5 to the negative second power

7
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,877
so you want to rewrite those as negative exponents.

8
00:00:20,877 --> 00:00:23,910
And to do that, we just have to remember that something

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,710
to a negative power is just (let me write it over here)

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,828
if I have x to the negative 2 power, this is the exact

11
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:39,594
same thing as 1 over x to the positive 2 power. If I have

12
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:45,111
a to the negative b power, this is the exact same thing as

13
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,409
one over a to the b power

14
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,977
You can get rid of that negative by just putting a 1 over

15
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:53,395
this whole thing. By taking the inverse of the whole expression

16
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,110
you can get rid of that negative.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,079
So let's do that over here. x to the negative 3 power,

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,401
that is equal to this (let me do this in a different

19
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:04,377
color). x to the negative 3rd power, that's the exact

20
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:08,201
same thing as one over x to the third power, by definition

21
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:12,868
Now we're going to multiply that by 5 to the negative 2

22
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:16,717
power. Well, 5 to the negative 2 power, same exact thing

23
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:21,151
that's the same thing as 1 over 5 to the 2nd power,

24
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:24,534
1 over 5 to the positive 2 power.

25
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:28,385
And then finally, we have just a straight up x squared

26
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,918
the exponent is already positive there, and we can just

27
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:34,566
leave that as times x squared.

28
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,985
So we did the first part; we rewrote the following

29
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:39,368
expression as a product of positive exponents.

30
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:42,635
Now let's evaluate the expression when x is equal

31
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,968
to two. So everywhere we see an x, we should put a 2. So this

32
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:50,068
becomes one over two to the (let me do this in the

33
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:54,269
same color). This becomes one over two to the third

34
00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:04,769
power times 1 over 5 squared times two squared.

35
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:06,985
Every place we saw an x, we're now putting a 2.

36
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,601
Two to the third power (just as a reminder)

37
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:15,285
that's 2 times 2 times 2. That is equal to 8

38
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:20,900
So this is equal to one over eight times one over

39
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,518
five squared.

40
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:27,769
Five squared is equal to 5 times 5 which is equal to 25.

41
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,568
This is equal to 25. And we're going to multiply that

42
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,634
times two squared, so that's

43
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:36,886
2 squared is equal to 2 times 2, which is equal

44
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:42,068
to 4. So times 4.

45
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:44,769
And you can even view this as times 4 over 1

46
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,001
And so you multiply all the numerators

47
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,167
That's what we do when we multiply fractions

48
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,081
You multiply all the numerators

49
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,165
One times One times four is equal to 4

50
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:55,883
And you multiply the denominators

51
00:02:55,883 --> 00:03:00,682
8 times 25 is going to be 200

52
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,666
And you can simplify this - the numerator and

53
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:07,566
the denominator are both divisible by 4

54
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:09,799
Divide the numerator by 4 and you get 1

55
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,316
Divide the denominator by 4 and you get 50

56
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:15,432
So this is equal to one over 50.

57
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:16,966
And just so you see there, there's actually a way to

58
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,832
simplify it before we got to this stage over here.

59
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,933
Actually from this stage we could have multiplied it out

60
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,099
If you (let me just rewrite this thing)

61
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,598
So this product, if we multiply it out, this 2 squared

62
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,182
you can view it as 2 squared over 1.

63
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,683
So if we were to multiply this out, the numerator

64
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:38,350
would have been equal to 1 times 1 times 2 squared

65
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,516
2 squared is just 2 times 2, so there would have been

66
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,917
2 times 2 in the numerator, we can ignore the 1,

67
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,515
that doesn't change the value.

68
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,766
And the denominator would have been

69
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:50,532
2 times 2 times 2 (that's what 2 to the third power is)

70
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:58,332
2 times 2 times 2 times 5 times 5

71
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,700
That's what 5 squared is, and of course multiplying it

72
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,666
by one doesn't change its value.

73
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,298
And then it would have been more obvious that you can

74
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,766
divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 once

75
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,149
you can do it again

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:13,665
and then you'd just be left with one over two

77
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:19,450
times 5 times 5.

78
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,783
And this of course down here is 50.

79
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,582
This 10 times 5 which is 50 and you would have

80
00:04:24,582 --> 99:59:59,999
gotten the same result.
