1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,640
I have triangle ABC here

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,170
And in the last that we did started to explore

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,610
some of the properties of points that are on angle bisectors

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,040
And now why I wanna do this with you

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,220
is just to see what happens

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,490
when we apply some of those ideas

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,300
to triangles or the angles in triangles

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,610
So let's bisect this angle right over here, angle B, A, C

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,160
and let me draw an angle bisector

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,250
So the angle bisector might look something

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,610
And I wanna make sure I get that angle right into pretty close

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,220
So that looks pretty close

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,360
So that's the angle bisector

14
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,860
Let me call this point right over here

15
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,580
I don't know

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,680
I could call this I could call this point D

17
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,850
And then let me draw another angle bisector,

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,540
the one that bisects angle ABC

19
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,440
So let me just draw this one

20
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,140
It looks it might look something like that right over there

21
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,680
And I can maybe call this point E

22
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,910
So AD bisects angle BAC

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,590
and BE bisects angle ABC

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,670
So the fact that this green line AD

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,260
bisects this angle right over here

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,230
That tells us that this angle must be equal

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,970
To that angle right over there

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,170
They must have the same measures

29
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,230
And the fact that this bisects this angle, angle ABC,

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,340
tells us that the measure of this angle, angle ABE,

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,520
must be equal to the measure of angle EBC

32
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,340
EBC

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,180
Now we see clearly that they have intersected

34
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,740
at a point inside of the triangle right over there

35
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,050
So let's call that point

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,330
Let me call that I just for fun

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm skipping a few letters,

38
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,680
but it will be it's a useful letter that based on

39
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,570
what we are going to call this in very short order

40
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,280
There's some interesting things we know about I

41
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,440
I sits on both of these angle bisectors

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,360
and we saw in the previous video that

43
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,360
any point that sits on an angle bisector

44
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,060
is equidistant from the 2 sides of that angle

45
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,630
So for example, I sits on AD so it's going to be equidistant

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,590
from the 2 sides of angle BAC

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,440
So this is one side right over here

48
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,740
This is one side right over there

49
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,130
And then this is the other side right over there

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,000
So because I sits on AD,

51
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,180
we know that these 2 distances are going to be the same

52
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,680
assuming this is the shortest distance between I and the sides

53
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,160
And we've also shown in the previous video that

54
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,400
when we talk about the distance between a point and a line,

55
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,780
we're talking about the shortest distance

56
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,410
which is the distance you get if you draw a perpendicular

57
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,600
So that's why I drew the perpendiculars right over there

58
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,980
And we could even let's label this some

59
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,060
This is could be point F

60
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,190
This could be point G right over here

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,980
So because I sits on AD, sits on this angle bisector,

62
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,390
we know that IF, we know that IF is going to be equal to,

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,060
is going to be equal to IG

64
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,130
Fair enough

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,740
Now I also sits on this angle bisector

66
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,370
It also sits on BE which says that

67
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,240
it must be equidistant from A

68
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,890
the distance to AB must be the same as I is distanced to BC

69
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,340
I's distance to AB,

70
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,230
we already just said is this right over here, it's IG

71
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,070
But we also know that that distance

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,550
must be the same as the distance between I and BC

73
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,340
So if I draw, if I draw another perpendicular right over here,

74
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,290
and let's say I call this point

75
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,230
Let's see I haven't used H right over here

76
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,960
This distance must be the same as this distance

77
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,580
because I sits on this bisector

78
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,710
So IG must be equal to IH

79
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,050
IG must be equal to IH

80
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,330
But IF is also equal to IG, so we can also say that IF,

81
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,670
I mean if IF is equal to IG is equal to IH,

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,160
we also know that IF, IF is equal to IH

83
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,950
Pretty much common sense!

84
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,150
If this is equal to that, that is equal to that,

85
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,400
then these 2 have to be equal to each other

86
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,200
But if I is equidistant from 2 sides of an angle,

87
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,460
this is the 2nd part of what we proved in the previous video

88
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,920
If you have a point that is equidistant from 2 sides of an angle,

89
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,920
then that point must sit on the angle bisector for that angle

90
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,270
So with this right here tells us,

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,010
tells us that I must be on angle bisector

92
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:20,750
I is on angle bisector, angle bisector sector of angle ACB

93
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,460
'cause it's equidistant to these 2 sides of angle ACB

94
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,370
And what we have just shown is,

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,730
is that there's a unique point inside the triangle

96
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,490
that sits on all 3 angle bisectors

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
It's not always obvious that if you took 3 lines,

98
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,100
in fact normally, if you took 3 lines

99
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,580
are not going to intersect in one point

100
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,650
2 lines is very reasonable thing to do,

101
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,390
but 3 lines not always gonna intersects in one point,

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,570
but once again, let me saw with the circumcenter

103
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,430
where we took the perpendicular bisectors of the side

104
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,760
That was pretty neat that they intersected in one point

105
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,140
Now it's also cool that we're showing that

106
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,200
the angle bisectors all intersect in one unique point

107
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,830
I is on the angle bisector of ACB,

108
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,120
so the angle the bisector of ACB will look something like this

109
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,180
Will look something like this

110
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,110
And this angle right over here is

111
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,610
going to be congruent to this angle right over there

112
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,840
So we have just shown that if you draw

113
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,130
If you take the 3 angle bisectors of a triangle,

114
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,340
it will intersect in a unique point right over there

115
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,890
that sits on all 3 of them so would

116
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,090
It seems worthwhile that we should call this something special

117
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,810
And we do!

118
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,310
And it's why I called it I

119
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
We call I the incenter, the incenter

120
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,380
The incenter of triangle ABC, ABC

121
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,250
And you're gonna see the 2nd why it's called the incenter

122
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,110
When we talk about the circumcenter,

123
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,970
that was the center of a circle that was

124
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,440
that could be circumscribed about the triangle

125
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,000
I, we'll see in about 5 seconds,

126
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,910
is the center of a circle that could be

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,440
that is circums that is

128
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,630
that can be put inside the triangle

129
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,320
that's tangent to the 3 sides

130
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,740
And how do we construct that?

131
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,710
Well, we have just established that

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,710
I is equidistant to each of the sides,

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,720
that this length is equal to that length is equal to that length

134
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,830
So what happens if you set up a circle with I as the center

135
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,160
that has a radius equal to the distance

136
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,600
between I and anyone of the sides which is equal,

137
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,740
that has a radius, that has a radius equal to IF, IG or IH?

138
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,600
Well then you're going to have a circle

139
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,080
that looks something like

140
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,900
You're going to have a circle that looks something like this

141
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,030
You're going

142
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,380
Let me draw it a little bit better than that

143
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,880
I don't have

144
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,810
Rarely, you can imagine

145
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,940
This is my best attempt to draw a circle

146
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,370
This circle right here that has the radius

147
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,830
equal to the distance between I and any of the sides,

148
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,560
which we've already established as being equal,

149
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,220
we see they're sitting inside of the circle

150
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,710
So why don't we call this an incircle!

151
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,200
So circle I

152
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,940
Remember you label circles usually with the point at the center

153
00:06:51,950 --> 00:07:00,790
Circle I is the incircle, incircle of triangle ABC

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,300
And of course, the radius of circle I so we could call,

155
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,050
we could call this length R

156
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,830
Let's say R is equal to IF which is equal to IH

157
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,080
which is equal to IG, is equal to IG

158
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,350
We can call that length the inradius

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,620
And it make sense because it's inside

160
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,770
When we had

161
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,880
When we were talking about the intersection of

162
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,630
the perpendicular bisectors, we had our circumcenter

163
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,220
because that was the center of a circle

164
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,460
that is circumscribed about the triangle

165
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,480
Now we're taking the intersection of the angle bisectors

166
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,520
and then, using that we're able to define a circle

167
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,420
that is kind of within the triangle,

168
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,100
and that whose sides are tangent to the circle

169
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,710
And since it's inside it, we call this incircle

170
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,240
We call the intersection of the angle bisectors the incenter

171
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,080
And we call this distance right over here the inradius
