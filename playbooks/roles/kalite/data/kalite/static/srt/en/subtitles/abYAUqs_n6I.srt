1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
   

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's say I have this matrix
B, here, and I want to know

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,330
what the null space of B is.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,720
And we've done this multiple
times but just as a review,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,000
the null space of B
is just all of the

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,570
x's that are a member.

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,640
It's all the vector x's that
are member of what?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that are members
of r to the fifth, where B, my

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,540
matrix B, times any of these
vector x's, is equal to 0.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,000
That's the definition
of the null space.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
I'm just trying to find the
solution set to this equation

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,100
right here.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,030
And we've seen before, that the
null set of the reduced

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,830
row echelon form of B is equal
to the null set of B.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,180
So what's the reduced row
echelon form of B?

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,340
And this is actually almost
trivially easy.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,460
Let me just take a couple of
steps right here-- to get a 0

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,940
here, let's just replace row
2 with row 2 minus row 1

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,760
So what do we get?

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,280
Row 2 minus row 1.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,500
Row 1 doesn't change, it's
just 1, 1, 2, 3, 2.

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,800
And then row 2 minus row 1.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,110
1 minus 1 is 0.

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,050
1 minus 1 is 0.

25
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,670
3 minus 2 is 1.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,080
1 minus 3 is minus 2.

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,580
4 minus is 2 is 2.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,230
We're almost there.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,250
Let's see, so this is a free
variable right here.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,780
This is a pivot variable
right here.

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,130
We have a 1.

32
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,740
So let me get rid of that
guy right there.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,060
And I can get rid of that guy
right there, by replacing row

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,170
1 with row 1 minus
2 times row 2.

35
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,390
So now row 2 is going
to be the same.

36
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,010
0, 0, 1 minus 2, 2.

37
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,550
And let me replace row 1 with
row 1 minus 2 times row 2.

38
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,450
So 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,510
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

40
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,800
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,870
3 minus 2 times minus 2.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,850
So that's 3 plus
4 is 7, right?

43
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,380
2 times this is minus 4 and
we're subtracting it.

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,230
And then 2 minus 2 times
2-- that's 2 minus

45
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,150
4-- it's minus 2.

46
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,270
So this is the reduced row
echelon form of B is equal to

47
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,370
that right there.

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,240
And then if I wanted to figure
out its null space, I have x1,

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:41,180
x2, x3, x4, and x5 equaling--
I'm going to have two 0's

50
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,050
right here.

51
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,770
Now I can just write this
as just a set of

52
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,290
or a system of equations.

53
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,750
So let me do that.

54
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,725
I get x1.

55
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm going to write my pivot
variables in a green color.

56
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:02,670
x1 plus 1 times x2, so plus
x2, plus 0 times x3.

57
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:08,460
Plus 7 times x4.

58
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,610
Minus 2 times x5 is equal
to that 0 right there.

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,350
And then I get my--
this is x3, right?

60
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,250
0 times x1 plus 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x3.

61
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:35,080
So I get x3 minus 2 times x4
plus 2 times x5 is equal to

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,220
that 0 right there.

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,860
And then if we solve for our
pivot variables, right?

64
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,790
These are our free variables.

65
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,570
We can set them equal
to anything.

66
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,440
If we solve for our pivot
variables what do we get?

67
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,960
We get x1 is equal to-- I
should do that in green.

68
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
The color coding helps.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:03,790
I get x1 is equal to minus x2
minus 7x4 plus 2x5, just

70
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,390
subtracted these from both
sides of the equation.

71
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,690
And I get x3 is equal to--
we've done this multiple

72
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,770
times-- 2x4 minus 2x5.

73
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,410
And so if I wanted to write
the solution set in vector

74
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:23,320
form, I could write my solution
set or my null space,

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,570
really, is-- or all
the possible x's.

76
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,220
x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

77
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,970
This is my vector
x, that's in r5.

78
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,460
It is equal to a linear
combination of these.

79
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,770
So let me write it out.

80
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:47,900
The free variables are x2 times
some vector right there.

81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,750
Plus x-- is x3, no x3 is
not a free variable.

82
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:57,130
Plus x4, that's my next free
variable, times some factor.

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,290
Plus x5 times some vector.

84
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,350
I've run out of space.

85
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,180
Plus x5 times some vector.

86
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,570
And what are those vectors?

87
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,630
Let's see.

88
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,960
I don't want to make this too
dirty, so let me see if I can

89
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,680
maybe move-- nope that's not
what I wanted to do.

90
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,430
Let me just rewrite this.

91
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,980
I haven't mastered this pen
tool yet, so let me

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,690
rewrite this here.

93
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,390
So x3 is equal to
2x4 minus 2x5.

94
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,650
Let me delete this right
over here so I

95
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,900
get some extra space.

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,420
   

97
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,065
Cross that out.

98
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:40,910
I think that's good enough.

99
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,050
So I can go back to what
I was doing before.

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,590
x5 times some vector
right here.

101
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,440
And now what are
those vectors?

102
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,650
We just have to look
at these formulas.

103
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,470
x1 is equal to minus
1 times x2.

104
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,020
So minus 1 times x2.

105
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,980
Minus 7 times x4.

106
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,370
Plus 2 times x5.

107
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,300
Fair enough.

108
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,292
And what is x3 equal to?

109
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,510
x3 is equal to 2x4.

110
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,700
   

111
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,910
2x4, right?

112
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,200
It had nothing to do with x2
right here, so it's equal to

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,540
2x4 minus 2x5.

114
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,950
   

115
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,830
And then 0 times x2, right?

116
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,960
Because it had no x2
term right here.

117
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,950
And then what is x2 equal to?

118
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,390
Well x2 is just equal
to 1 times x2.

119
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,540
And so all of these terms
are 0 right there.

120
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,300
And I want you to pay
attention to that.

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,280
I'll write it right here.

122
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,850
x2 is a free variable, so it's
just equal to itself, right?

123
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,300
1 and you write a 0 and a 0.

124
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,510
x4 is a free variable.

125
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,360
And this is the important
point of this exercise.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
So it's just equal to
1 times itself.

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
You don't have to throw in any
of the other free variables.

128
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,940
And x5 is a free variable.

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,870
So it just equals 1 times itself
and none of the other

130
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,050
free variables.

131
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,420
So right here we now say that
all of the solutions of our

132
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,120
equation Bx equals 0, or the
reduced row echelon form of B

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,080
times x is equal to 0,
will take this form.

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,090
Or they are linear combinations
of these vectors.

135
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,890
Let's call this v1,
v2, and v3.

136
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,530
These are just random
real numbers.

137
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,665
I can pick any combination here
to create this solution

138
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,120
set, or to create
our null space.

139
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,230
So the null space of A, which is
of course equal to the null

140
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,810
space of the reduced row echelon
form of A, is equal to

141
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,900
all the possible linear
combinations of these 3

142
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:53,340
vectors, is equal to the span
of my vector v1, v2, and v3.

143
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,490
Just like that.

144
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,730
Now, the whole reason I went
through this exercise--

145
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,690
because we've done this multiple
times already-- is to

146
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,560
think about whether these guys
form a linear independent set.

147
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,090
So my question is are these
guys linearly independent?

148
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,670
And the reason why I care is
because if they are linearly

149
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,290
independent then they
form a basis for

150
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,490
the null space, right?

151
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,860
That we know that they span the
null space, but if they're

152
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,020
linearly independent,
then that's the 2

153
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,010
constraints for a basis.

154
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,970
You have to span the subspace,
and you have to be linearly

155
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,900
independent.

156
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,210
So let's just inspect these
guys right here.

157
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,480
This v1, he has a
1 right here.

158
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,460
He has a 1 in the second term
because he corresponds to the

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,620
free variable x2, which is
the second entry, so we

160
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,780
just throw a 1 here.

161
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,960
And we have a 0 everywhere
else in all of the other

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,210
vectors in our spanning set.

163
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,180
And that's because for the other
free variables we always

164
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,815
wanted to multiply them
times a 0, right?

165
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:57,060
And this is going to
be true of any null

166
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,960
space problem we do.

167
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,670
For any free variable, if this
free variable represents a

168
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,100
second entry, we're going
to have a 1 in the

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,150
second entry here.

170
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,060
And then a 0 for the second
entry for all of the other

171
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,900
vectors associated with the
other free variables.

172
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,330
So can this guy ever be
represented as a linear

173
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,890
combination of this
guy and that guy?

174
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,730
Well there's nothing that I can
multiply this 0 by and add

175
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,240
to something that I multiply
this 0 by to get a 1 here.

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,670
It's just going to get 0's.

177
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,330
So this guy can't be
representated as a linear

178
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,880
combination of these guys.

179
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Likewise, this vector
right here has a 1

180
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
in the fourth position.

181
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,940
Why is it a fourth position?

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,570
Because the fourth position
corresponds to its

183
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,410
corresponding free
variable, x4.

184
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,750
So this guy's a 1 here.

185
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,190
These other guys
will definitely

186
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,410
always have a 0 here.

187
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,020
So you can't take any linear
combination of

188
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,710
them to get this guy.

189
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,590
So this guy can't be represented
as a linear

190
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,860
combination of those guys.

191
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,640
And last, this x5 guy, right
here, has a 1 here.

192
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,610
And these guys have 0's here.

193
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,000
So no linear combination of
these 0's can equal this 1.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,500
So all of these guys are
linearly independent.

195
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,790
You can't construct any of
these vectors with some

196
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,180
combination of the other.

197
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,950
So they are linearly
independent.

198
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:19,390
So v1, the set v1, v2, and v3
is actually a basis for the

199
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,770
null space, for the null space
of-- Oh, you know what, I have

200
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,480
to be very careful.

201
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,330
For the null space of B.

202
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,940
Just for variety, I defined my
initial matrix as matrix B, so

203
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,970
let me be very careful here.

204
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,930
So the null space of B was equal
to the null space of the

205
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,700
reduced row echelon form of B.

206
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,910
It's good to switch things up
every once in a while, you

207
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,280
start thinking that
every matrix is

208
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,420
named A if you don't.

209
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,540
And that's equal to the
span of these vectors.

210
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,550
So these vectors, and we just
said that they're linearly

211
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,980
independent.

212
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,470
We just showed that because
there's no way to get that one

213
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,780
from these guys, that one from
these guys, or that one from

214
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,820
these guys.

215
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,420
These guys form a basis for
the null space of B.

216
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,300
Now this raises an interesting
question.

217
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,090
In the last video, I defined
what dimensionality is.

218
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,550
And maybe you missed
it because that

219
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,080
video was kind of proofy.

220
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,730
But the dimensionality, the
dimension, of a subspace--

221
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:25,760
I'll redefine it here-- is the
number of elements in a basis

222
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,220
for the subspace.

223
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,830
And in the last video I took
great pains to show that all

224
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,030
bases for any given subspace
will have the

225
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,190
same number of elements.

226
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,740
So this is well defined.

227
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,760
So my question to you now is:
what is the dimension of my

228
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,560
null space of B?

229
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,630
What is that the dimension
of my null space of B?

230
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,200
Well, the dimension is just
the number of vectors in a

231
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,420
basis set for B.

232
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,280
Well this is a basis set
for B right there.

233
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,880
And how many vectors
do I have in it?

234
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,000
I have 1, 2 3 vectors.

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,670
So the dimension of the
null space of B is 3.

236
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,760
Or another way to think about
it-- or another name for the

237
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,510
dimension of the null space
of B-- is the nullity, the

238
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,970
nullity of B.

239
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,410
And that is also equal to 3.

240
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,870
And let's think about
it, you know I went

241
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,010
through all this exercise.

242
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,480
But what is the nullity of any
matrix going to be equal to?

243
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,520
It's the dimension of
the null space.

244
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Well the dimension of the null
space-- you're always going to

245
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,360
have as many factors here as
you have free variables.

246
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,720
   

247
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:41,680
So in general, the nullity of
any matrix of any matrix--

248
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,160
let's say matrix A-- is equal
to the number of I guess you

249
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,110
could call it free variable
columns or the number free

250
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:59,950
variables in, well, I guess we
call it in the reduced row

251
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,790
echelon form, or I guess we
could say the number of

252
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,290
non-pivot columns.

253
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:14,700
The number of non-pivot columns
in the reduced row

254
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,730
echelon form of A.

255
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,665
Because that's essentially the
number of free variables-- all

256
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,780
of those free variables have
an associated, linearly

257
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,880
independent vector with
each of them, right?

258
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,970
So the number of variables is
the number of vectors you're

259
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,450
going to have in your basis
for your null space.

260
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,650
And the number of free variables
is essentially the

261
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,970
number of non-pivot columns
in your reduced row

262
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,870
echelon form, right?

263
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,520
This was a non-pivot column,
that's a non-pivot column,

264
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,870
that's a non-pivot column.

265
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,370
And they're associated
with the free

266
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,510
variables x2, x4, and x5.

267
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,710
So the nullity of a matrix is
essentially the number of

268
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,910
non-pivot columns in the reduced
row echelon form of

269
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,940
that matrix.

270
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,110
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
