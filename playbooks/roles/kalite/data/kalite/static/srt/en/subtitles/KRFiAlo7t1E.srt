1
00:00:00,244 --> 00:00:03,835
What I want to do in this video is to familiarize ourselves

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,507
with the notion of a sequence.

3
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,050
And all sequences is an ordered list of numbers.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,727
So for example, I could have a finite sequence

5
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,919
that means I don't have an infinite number of numbers in it.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,831
Where, let's say I start at one and I keep adding three, so one plus three is four

7
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:22,036
four plus three is seven, seven plus three is ten.

8
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:25,569
And let's say I only have these four terms over here

9
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:29,503
so this one we would call a finite sequence.

10
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:30,968
I could also have an infinite sequence

11
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:32,969
so, an example of an infinite sequence

12
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,836
let's say, we start at three and we keep adding four

13
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:43,176
so, go to three, to seven, to eleven, fifteen.

14
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,970
And you don't always have to add the same thing

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,569
we'll explore fancier sequences

16
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:48,643
one, the sequences where you keep adding the same amount

17
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,164
we call these arithmetic sequences

18
00:00:50,164 --> 00:00:54,236
which we will also, explore in more of a detail.

19
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:57,434
But to show that this is infinite, to show that we keep this pattern going

20
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,978
on and on and on, I'll put three dots.

21
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:03,171
This just means we're going to keep going on and on and on so we could call this

22
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:07,354
an infinite sequence.

23
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:11,433
Now, there's a bunch of different notations that seem fancy for denoting sequences

24
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,245
but this is all they refer to, but I want to make us comfortable

25
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:19,387
with how we can denote sequences and also how we can define them.

26
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:21,970
So we could say, that this right over here

27
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,328
is the sequence, a sub k, for k is going

28
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:33,898
from one to four, is equal to this right over here.

29
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:38,034
So when we look at it this way, we can look at each of these as a terms in the sequence

30
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,501
and this right over here would be the first term

31
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,236
we would call that a sub one, this right over here

32
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,102
would be the second term, we call it a sub two, I think you get the picture.

33
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:51,170
a sub three, this right over here is a sub four.

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,775
So this just says all of the a sub k's from k equals one

35
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:57,852
from our first term all the way to the fourth term.

36
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:02,842
Now I could also define it by not, explicitly writing the sequence

37
00:02:02,842 --> 00:02:06,386
like this, I could essentially do it using, defining our sequence

38
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:09,637
as explicitly using a kind of a function notation or something close

39
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:11,221
to function notation.

40
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:18,169
So the same exact sequence, I could define it as a sub k

41
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:21,518
from k equals one to four

42
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:24,683
with, instead of explicitly writing the numbers here.

43
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:29,500
I could say a sub k, is equal to some function of k.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,707
So let's see what happens, when k is one we get one

45
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:39,702
when k is two, we get four, when k is three, we get seven

46
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:43,211
so see when k is three we added three twice

47
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,779
let me make it clear.

48
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:49,703
So this was plus three, this right over here was a plus three

49
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,440
this right over here, is a plus three.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,903
So whatever k is, we started at one and we added three

51
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:59,236
one less than the k term times.

52
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,070
So we could say that this is going to be

53
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:13,235
equal to one, plus k minus one times three

54
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,902
or maybe I should write three time k minus one, same thing.

55
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:19,652
Three times k, minus one.

56
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:22,262
And you can verify that this works

57
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,609
so you can verify that this works.

58
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:31,101
If k is equal to one, you're gonna get one minus one is zero

59
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:34,651
and so, a sub one is going to be one, if k is equal to two

60
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:37,101
you're going to have one plus three which is four.

61
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:41,106
If k is equal to three, you get three times two plus one is seven

62
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,302
so it works out.

63
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:48,232
So this is one way to explicitly define our sequence with kind of this function notation.

64
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:50,903
I want to make it clear, I have essentially defined a function here.

65
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:53,145
If I wanted more traditional function notation

66
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:57,897
I could've written a of k, or k is the term that I care about

67
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:02,567
a of k is equal to one plus three times k minus one.

68
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,969
This is essentially a function where an allowable input

69
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,969
the domain is restricted to positive integers.

70
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:12,235
Now, how would I denote this business right over here.

71
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:17,113
Well, I could say this is equal to, and people tend to use a

72
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:20,170
but I could use the notation b sub k or anything else

73
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,635
but I'll do a again.

74
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:26,034
A sub k, and here we're going from our first term

75
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:32,637
so this is a sub one, this is a sub two, all the way to infinity.

76
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:37,062
Or we could define if we wanted to define an explicitly as a function

77
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:43,833
we could write the sequence as a sub k, where k starts at the first term

78
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:53,775
and goes to infinity, with a sub k is equaling, so we're starting at three

79
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:58,768
and we are adding four, one less time for the second term

80
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:02,109
we added four once, for the third term we add four twice

81
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:05,607
for the fourth term we add four three times.

82
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,433
So we're adding four one less than the term that we're at.

83
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:15,840
So it's going to be plus four times four times k minus one

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,437
four times k minus one, so this another way of defining

85
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:22,592
this infinite sequence.

86
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:26,670
Now, in both of these cases I defined it as an explicit function

87
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,827
so this right over here is explicit.

88
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,569
This is an explicit function.

89
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,304
And so you might say well what's another way of defining these functions.

90
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:43,981
Well we can also define it, especially with something like this

91
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,991
Like an arithmetic sequence we can also define it recursively.

92
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:51,037
And I want to be clear, not every sequence can be defined as either an explicit function

93
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,902
like this or, as a recursive function

94
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,665
but many can, including this which is an arithmetic sequence

95
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,976
where we keep adding the same quantity over and over again.

96
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:03,753
So how would we do that, well we could also another way of defining this first sequence

97
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:10,469
we could say a sub k, starting at k equals one, and going to four

98
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:14,512
with and when you define things recursively, when you define a sequence recursively

99
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:21,084
you want to define what your first term is with a sub one, equaling one.

100
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:25,369
And then you can define every other term in the terms of the term before it

101
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:30,210
and so we could write a of k plus, or let me write it this way

102
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:37,667
a sub k is equal to the previous term

103
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,569
so this is a sub k minus one, so the given term is equal to the previous term

104
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:48,433
let me make it clear, this is the previous term, plus the previous term plus

105
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:52,909
in this case we're adding three every time.

106
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,141
Now how does this make sense, well we're defining what a sub one is

107
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,503
and if someone says, well what happens when k equals two

108
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,911
well they're saying well it's going to be a sub two minus one

109
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,167
so it's going to be a sub one plus three.

110
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:09,108
Well we know a sub one is one, so it's going to be one plus three, which is four.

111
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:12,376
Well what about a sub three, well it's going to be a sub two plus three

112
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:15,225
a sub two we just calculate it as four, you add three it's going to be seven.

113
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:18,843
This is essentially what we mentally did when I first wrote out the sequence

114
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:25,769
when I said hey I'm just going to start with one, and I'm just going to add three for every successive term.

115
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,690
So how would we do this one

116
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:33,970
well once again, we could write this as a sub k, starting at k at the first term

117
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:40,504
going to infinity with our first term, a sub one is going to be three now

118
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:50,976
and every successive term a sub k, is going to be the previous term, a sub k minus one plus four.

119
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:54,192
And once again you start at three, and then if you want the second term

120
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,777
it's going to be the first term plus four, it's going to be three plus four

121
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:06,294
you get to seven and you keep adding four, so both of these, this right over here is a recursive definition.

122
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:12,237
We started with kind of a base case, and then every term is defined in terms of the terms before it

123
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:16,237
or in terms of the function itself, but the function for a different term.
