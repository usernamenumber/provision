1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,860
   

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,040
Let's do a little review of what
the Fed funds rate was.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,550
   

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,090
And then we can move into
something that you've probably

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,180
heard in the same context, and
they're often confused, and

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,430
that's the discount rate.

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,580
   

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,310
And they are related and they
kind of do move together.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,020
They are pretty different in
their actual implementation.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,040
So the Federal funds rate--
this is a target rate.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,370
This is the target rate at
which the Federal reserve

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,940
wants banks to lend
to each other.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,500
So let's say that I have-- and
I won't draw the balance

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,400
sheets every time now-- let's
say I have have Bank One and

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,470
this is Bank Number Two.

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,630
And let's say this bank
over here has

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,910
a surplus of reserves.

18
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,230
I was already using green, but
I'll do that in gold just so

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,570
we can reminisce about
the gold standard.

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,560
So let's say it has a surplus of
reserves and Bank Two needs

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,870
them, right?

22
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,650
And let's say right now that
Bank One is willing to lend it

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:16,380
to Bank Two if Bank Two pays
Bank One a 6% overnight rate.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,310
And let's say that the
Federal reserve, they

25
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,120
say, you know what?

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
That's above our target rate.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,860
We want banks to lend to each
other for a lower interest

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,730
rate, so we want to do open
market transactions or open

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,670
market operations to
lower this rate.

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,080
And the mechanics that they do
it by-- let's draw the Fed's

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,330
balance sheet.

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,550
   

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,800
I'll do them in magenta.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:50,120
   

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,245
That's half of it and then
this is the other half.

36
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,700
   

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,610
So let's say that this is the
Fed's current assets-- and in

38
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,650
a couple of videos, I'll
actually show you what the

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,220
Fed's balance sheet looked like
before all this craziness

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,050
started and what it looks like
now, but that's the Federal

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,510
reserve's assets.

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,530
This is their liabilities.

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,740
And then their liabilities are
going to be a little bit

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,170
smaller then their assets and
they have a little equity.

45
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,220
Their equity's a little
different

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,640
than traditional equity.

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,890
There really isn't
a lot of upside.

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,340
You just get a dividend
on it, but we won't

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,330
go to details there.

50
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,400
But the mechanism that the Fed
uses to do these open market

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,110
operations is they essentially
print money.

52
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,980
So what the Federal reserve will
do is, they will create

53
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,680
some notes or some
actual reserves.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,740
So these are Federal reserve
notes-- or as we know them,

55
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,370
the dollar bills that are
sitting in your wallet or the

56
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,660
things that could be converted
to dollar bills that are

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,540
sitting in your bank account,
the bits and bytes in some

58
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,120
computer database someplace.

59
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,730
And they can't create
it out of thin air.

60
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,930
They have to have an offsetting
liability and their

61
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,560
offsetting liability are
Federal reserve notes

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,810
outstanding.

63
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,180
   

64
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
This is just saying, hey,
we issued this.

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,310
If someone comes back to us,
we have this liability.

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,620
And this is issued even though
these Federal reserve notes--

67
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,190
I'll circle it in yellow--
are issued by the

68
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,610
Federal reserve bank.

69
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,300
They're backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S.

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,880
government.

71
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,210
We've talked a lot about what
that means, but needless to

72
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,550
say, we're just going
over the mechanics.

73
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,110
So what they'll do is they'll
take these dollars now and

74
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,240
they'll use these dollars to go
buy treasuries from people

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,010
out in the world.

76
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,780
It could be me.

77
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,320
It could be my grandfather.

78
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,640
It could be even some of these
banks and so let's say that

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,280
there's-- right now somebody
is holding a treasury.

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,760
   

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,180
I hold a T-bill.

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,960
   

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,350
The Federal reserve will use
that money-- let's say I own a

84
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,420
ton of T-bills.

85
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,380
I'm the richest man
in the country.

86
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,340
I could even be China.

87
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,240
China holds a lot of T-bills.

88
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
They buy the T-bill.

89
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,720
So then this becomes-- this
asset is no longer Federal

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,460
reserve notes.

91
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,710
It's now a T-bill.

92
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,400
   

93
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,300
And then I'm no longer holding
a T-bill, right, because I

94
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,990
sold it to the Federal
reserve bank.

95
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,760
I don't know I sold it to the
Federal reserve bank.

96
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,790
I just sold it in the market.

97
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,540
I don't know who bought it.

98
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,070
It might have been
another guy.

99
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,190
It might have been
another country.

100
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,950
But it happened to be in this
case the Federal reserve bank.

101
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,660
And now I'm holding reserves.

102
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,950
I'm holding money
as we know it.

103
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,700
I'm holding a Federal
reserve note.

104
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,430
And what am I going to do with
that Federal reserve note?

105
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,910
I'm going to deposit
it in banks, right?

106
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,130
And so I'm going to take this
Federal reserve note.

107
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,830
Let's say I have a couple
of bank accounts.

108
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,220
Just for the sake of simplicity,
I deposit some of

109
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,430
it in this bank account and
let's say I deposit some of it

110
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,210
in this bank account,
just for simplicity.

111
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,620
So what happens now?

112
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,940
Now this guy has more notes
to lend out and

113
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,680
this guy needs less.

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,680
So demand has gone down.

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,140
This guy needs less.

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,890
So demand has gone down
from this guy.

117
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,790
And supply has gone
up from this guy.

118
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,000
We know that if you need
something less, but people

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,710
have more of it, the price of
buying it or borrowing it is

120
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,990
going to go down.

121
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,290
So this guy has more of it and
this guy needs it less, all of

122
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,670
a sudden this guy's
not willing to pay

123
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,330
6% to borrow it.

124
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,730
And this guy's actually more
desperate to offload some of

125
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,660
these reserves and get
some interest on it.

126
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,110
So this guy's going to lower the
rate he'll charge and this

127
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,500
guy's going to lower the rate
he's willing to pay and maybe

128
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,490
it goes down to 5%.

129
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,110
And the Federal reserve can
keep buying or selling

130
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,150
treasuries to adjust
what this happens.

131
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,350
They could do the opposite.

132
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,450
If they said, wow, rates are
a little bit too low.

133
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,410
Let's say whatever happens,
rates are at 3% and the

134
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,050
Federal reserve doesn't like
that and wants to raise the

135
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,830
Federal funds rate, which is
the target rate that banks

136
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,740
lend to each other, then they
can do the opposite thing.

137
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,500
They could take this
T-bill, right?

138
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,410
This was a T-bill.

139
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,170
And they'll sell it, right?

140
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,240
So they'll take this T-bill and
they'll sell it to someone

141
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,470
else-- maybe this
guy right here.

142
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,070
So this guy, he's got
a dollar bill.

143
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,190
So his dollar bills are
going to be sitting at

144
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,700
one of these banks.

145
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,240
Let's say his dollar bills are
sitting at one of-- he's got a

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,980
couple there and couple there.

147
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,390
So when the Federal reserve
sells this T-bill to this guy,

148
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,490
this guy might do a wire
transfer to that party-- or a

149
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,450
check or it doesn't matter, but
either way you look at it,

150
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,680
these reserves disappear
and they go back

151
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,740
into the Federal reserve.

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,150
When they go back into the
Federal reserve, they offset

153
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,410
this liability and then the
currency essentially

154
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,970
disappears, but the real result
is that all of a sudden

155
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,900
then demand would have gone up
because there'd be fewer

156
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,110
reserves in the system.

157
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,170
Demand goes up.

158
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,840
And then the supply would have
gone down because there's also

159
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
fewer reserves in the system.

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,960
And now this guy, he's like,
wow, I have less to lend out.

161
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,400
I need more interest in order
for me lend it out.

162
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,580
And this guy says, wow, I'm more
desperate than ever to

163
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,710
borrow some reserves.

164
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,330
I'm willing to pay more and so
the rates will go up to 4%.

165
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,080
Now all of this works well
assuming a world where banks

166
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
are willing to lend to each
other at some rate.

167
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,610
There's some rate at which this
guy says, I'm willing to

168
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,460
lend to this guy because I know
he's going to pay me the

169
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,700
next day and it's
just a matter of

170
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,850
just supply or demand.

171
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,430
These tend to be overnight
loans.

172
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,780
They tend to be very short term
loans so they tend to be

173
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,230
very, very safe, but what
happens in a world-- let me

174
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,280
draw the same two banks.

175
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,720
I think I overdrew.

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,600
So this is Bank Number One and
this is Bank Number Two-- and

177
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,800
Bank Number One had
more reserves.

178
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,940
Bank Number Two has fewer.

179
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,250
Bank Number Two needs
reserves.

180
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,680
Let's say people are worried
about Bank Number Two.

181
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,420
All of their depositors are
starting to get scared and

182
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,460
they're starting to pull their
reserves out, right?

183
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,320
And we all know that these
banks don't keep enough

184
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
reserves to fulfill all
of their deposits.

185
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,310
Actually, let me draw Bank
Number Two's balance sheet.

186
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:10,690
   

187
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,050
They have equity, hopefully.

188
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,050
They'll have some deposits.

189
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,300
Let's say all of these
are deposits.

190
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,210
   

191
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,780
They have to keep some
reserves, right,

192
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,280
so that's an asset.

193
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,550
Depending on their reserve
requirements, but they'll have

194
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,179
some reserves in case people
want to take out their money

195
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,200
from their checking accounts--
and then the rest of these are

196
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,460
assets that they invested in
and the bank makes money by

197
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,820
making more money on these
assets than it has to pay out

198
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,790
in interest. It makes money
on that spread.

199
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,020
Now what happens if this bank--
its condition starts to

200
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,800
get a little bit weak, people
start to get afraid, and the

201
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,160
deposits start to-- people go
to their ATM, start pulling

202
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,180
their money out, and if anything
maybe they'll start

203
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,470
depositing it into a safer bank
or just stuffing it under

204
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,070
their mattresses, right?

205
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,150
This bank says, all of a sudden
I have a liquidity

206
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,640
issue because, sure, maybe
that much people withdraw

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:04,950
their money.

208
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:08,880
I have enough reserves to pay
that, but then if another guy

209
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,030
comes along, that's going to
deplete my reserves and then

210
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,870
when the next guy comes along,
I'm not going to have any

211
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,150
reserves left and it's going
to be a full all-out panic

212
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,490
when I-- I told this guy that I
could give him his money on

213
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,220
demand and all of a sudden, if
I can't give him on demand,

214
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,690
then we're going to have this
huge banking panic and then

215
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,300
everyone else is going to want
their deposits and then I'm

216
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,960
going to have this huge
liquidity crisis.

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,110
In a normal situation like
that, I'd say, hey, Bank

218
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,680
Number One, I need some reserves
and just like I did

219
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,850
in the first half of this video,
this guy would lend the

220
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,740
reserves and then this guy would
give this guy interest.

221
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,660
But what if this guy is scared
of Bank Number Two too?

222
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,000
He's like, wow, that guy's
in a tough situation.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,900
He's facing a liquidity
crisis.

224
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,790
I don't even know what
his assets are worth.

225
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,960
Maybe his assets are
actually shrinking.

226
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,010
And that's been happening
lately.

227
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,480
Maybe he made a bunch of
bad mortgage loans.

228
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,110
I don't want to lend
to this guy.

229
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,530
And this guy becomes a pariah
of the banking community.

230
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,700
No-one wants to lend
to this guy.

231
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,840
But at the same time, it's in
no-one's interest for there to

232
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,790
be a run on this bank.

233
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,550
Because if this guy can't pay
one of his depositors-- and

234
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,590
this is kind of a prime weakness
of a fractional

235
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,450
reserve system.

236
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,040
If there's just one weak link
in the banking system and

237
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,650
people lose confidence-- maybe
this guy was the only bad bank

238
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,330
out there and people start
taking all their money out.

239
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,600
The first guy who can't get his
money back, he's going to

240
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,900
call up the press and say,
my God, the banks aren't

241
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,410
good for the money.

242
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,660
Maybe there's a run on all the
banks because people don't

243
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,020
know which banks are good,
which ones are bad.

244
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,850
So to prevent this, the Federal
reserve has something

245
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,180
called the discount window.

246
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,900
So let me draw the Federal
reserve's balance sheet again.

247
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,880
And the discount window is
essentially a lender of last

248
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,970
resort to the banks.

249
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,630
So there's some type of
Federal funds rate.

250
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,670
Let's say the Federal
funds rate is at 6%.

251
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,240
In a normal environment,
this guy would lend

252
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,570
to get back at 6%.

253
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,380
But let's say that's
broken and this

254
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,700
guy is really desperate.

255
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:04,570
He can actually go to the
Federal reserve and borrow

256
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,650
directly from the
Federal reserve.

257
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,830
So once again, these are the
assets of the Federal reserve.

258
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,540
   

259
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,250
These are the liabilities.

260
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,020
This is the equity of
the Federal reserve.

261
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,270
And the Federal reserve in this
situation now, they'll

262
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,790
print notes-- so Federal reserve
notes or reserves,

263
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,810
either way-- and these are the
notes outstanding liability.

264
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,910
And they will lend
it to this guy.

265
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,480
They'll lend these notes to this
guy and in exchange, this

266
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,030
guy has to give some collateral

267
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,510
to the Federal reserve.

268
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,330
So let's say he had some
other assets here

269
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,210
that are hard to sell.

270
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,900
He didn't want to sell
them in a hurry.

271
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,300
So he'll just keep
it as collateral

272
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,540
with the Federal reserve.

273
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,000
And these are called repurchased
transactions.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,120
It's essentially just-- you're
collateralizing a loan-- and

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,910
I'll do a whole video on what a
repo transaction is, but the

276
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,150
big picture is, this
guy is desperate.

277
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,000
No-one else is willing to lend
him money so the Federal funds

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,020
rate is now a non-issue.

279
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,790
So he goes to the discount
window and borrows directly

280
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,750
from the Federal reserve as
a lender of last resort.

281
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,640
And the rate at which he
borrows-- the interest that he

282
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,960
pays this guy, that is
the discount rate.

283
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,950
So that's the rate that a bank
pays to the Federal reserve

284
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,950
when it can't borrow from
another bank overnight.

285
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:27,770
And in general, the discount
rate tends to be higher than

286
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,490
the Federal funds rate.

287
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,640
In fact, it always is, right?

288
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,230
Because if the discount rate
was less than the Federal

289
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,880
funds rate, then you'd always
have people using the discount

290
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,810
window all of the time instead
of borrowing from each other.

291
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,030
But we'll see in future videos,
when times get tough,

292
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,760
this gets used a lot more.

293
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,090
Historically the discount rate
was about a percent higher

294
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,930
than the Federal funds rate to
encourage people to lend to

295
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,320
each other or borrow from each
other, but in the recent past

296
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,380
that spread is gone down and
now all of the rates are

297
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,650
almost zero, but we'll go into
that in more detail, but it's

298
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,190
a key differential.

299
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,280
When the Federal reserve talks
about setting rates, they're

300
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,740
usually talking about setting
the Federal funds rate and the

301
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,260
discount rate usually moves down
with it, but it's always

302
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,470
going to be a little
bit higher than the

303
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,680
Federal funds rate.

304
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,950
This is for lending
of last resort.

305
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,010
This is for everyday borrowing
between banks to make sure

306
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,910
that everyone has the reserves
they need or they don't have

307
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,640
too much and they can
get interest on it.

308
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

309
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,920
