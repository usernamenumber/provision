1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,568
What I want to do in this video is give ourselves

2
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:07,546
a basic introduction to the phenomenon of light.

3
00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:09,407
And light is, atleast to me, it is mysterious

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,986
because on one level it really defines our reality

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:17,646
it may be the most defining caracteristic of our reality

6
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:21,238
everything we see, how we percieve reality is based

7
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:25,976
on light bouncing off of objects, or bending around objects or difffracting around objects.

8
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:30,135
and then being sensed by our eyes and then

9
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:34,732
sending signals into our brain that create models of the world we see around us

10
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:36,127
so it really is almost a defining

11
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:40,079
characteristic of our reality, but at the same time,

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,183
when you really go down to experiment and observe with light,

13
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:46,638
its starts to have a bunch of mysterious

14
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:50,407
properties and to a large degree it is not fully understood yet.

15
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:54,033
And probably the most amazing thing about light

16
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,281
...well, actually there is tons of thing amazing about light....

17
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,616
but one of the mysterious things is

18
00:00:58,616 --> 00:00:59,934
when you really get down to it, and this is actually not just true of light,

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,133
this is actually true of almost anything once you

20
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:06,748
get onto a small enough quantum mechanical level,

21
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:12,336
but light behaves as both a wave AND a particle.

22
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:14,755
And this is, probably not that intuitive to you, because its

23
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,144
not that intuitive to me!

24
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:18,583
In my life I'm used to certain things

25
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:20,655
behaving as a waves, like sound waves,

26
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,387
or the waves of an ocean.

27
00:01:22,387 --> 00:01:25,380
And I'm used to certain things behaving like particles.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,098
Like... Basket balls, or... I don't know...

29
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:30,604
Or... My coffee cup. I'm not used to things

30
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:31,565
behaving as both!

31
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,470
And it really depends on what experiment

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,456
you run and how you observe the light.

33
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:38,326
So, when you observe it as a particle,

34
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:41,619
And this comes out of Einstein's work with the photo-electric effect.

35
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,040
And I won't go into the details here, maybe in a future video

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,162
when we start thinking about quantum mechanics.

37
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:54,411
You can view light as a train of particles moving at the speed of light.

38
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:56,203
Which I'll talk about in a second...

39
00:01:56,203 --> 00:02:01,283
We call these particles PHOTONS.

40
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:03,368
If you view light in other ways

41
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,508
and you see it even when you see light beam

42
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:09,513
refracted by a prism here, it looks like it is a wave.

43
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:12,416
And it has the properties of a wave.

44
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,767
It has a frequency and it has a wavelength.

45
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:22,951
And like other waves, the velocity, of that wave, is the frequency times its wave length [v = f * lambda]

46
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,410
Now, even within, even if you ignore this particle aspect of light

47
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,369
If you just look at the wave aspect of the light it's still fascinating because

48
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:36,133
most waves require a medium to travel through.

49
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:38,110
So for example: If I think about how

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,275
sound travels through air.

51
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,968
So let me draw a bunch of air particles.

52
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:43,945
Air particles right here

53
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,314
I'll draw a sound wave traveling through the air particles.

54
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:49,467
What happens in a sound wave is:

55
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:52,780
You compress some of the air particles

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,637
and those compress the ones next to them.

57
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:57,702
And so you have points in the air that have higher, I guess you could say, higher pressure

58
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,442
and points that have lower pressure,

59
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,975
and you can plot that.

60
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:07,455
So we have high pressure over here. High pressure, low pressure, high pressure, low pressure...

61
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,863
And as these things bump into each other and this wave essentially travels

62
00:03:09,863 --> 00:03:12,566
to the right, and if you were to plot that

63
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,484
you would see this wave form traveling to the right.

64
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:19,369
But this is all predicated, or this is all based on this energy

65
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:30,459
traveling through a medium and I'm used to visualizing waves in that way but light NEEDS NO MEDIUM!

66
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,762
Light needs no medium

67
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:38,579
Light will actually travel fastest through nothing, through a vacuum.

68
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:47,765
And it will travel at an unimaginably fast speed: 3*10^8 m/s.

69
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:48,265
Just to give you a sense of this:

70
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:52,780
This is 300 million meters per second. Or another way

71
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,796
of thinking about it is: It would take light less than a

72
00:03:57,796 --> 00:04:00,533
seventh of a second to travel around the earth, or

73
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,969
it would travel around the earth more then seven times in a second.

74
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,477
So unimaglably fast. And not only is this just a super fast rate,

75
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:11,124
or a super fast speed but once again

76
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:13,758
it tells us that light is something fundamental to our universe,

77
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:17,800
because it's not just an unimaginable fast speed, it is THE FASTEST speed,

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,037
not just known to physics, but POSSIBLE in physics.

79
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:26,175
So once again something very unintuitive to us in our everyday realm.

80
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:30,028
We always imagine that: "OK, if something is going at some speed,

81
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,028
maybe if there is a ant riding on top of that something

82
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:35,133
moving in the same direction it would be going even faster.

83
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,709
But nothing can go faster that the SPEED OF LIGHT.

84
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:43,542
It's absolutely impossible based on our current understanding of physics.

85
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:55,184
So its not just a fast speed it is THE FASTEST SPEED. It is the fastest speed possible

86
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:56,245
And this right here is an approximation,

87
00:04:56,245 --> 00:05:02,493
it's actually 2.99 something, something times 10 to the 8th meters per second...

88
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:07,410
But 3 times 10 to the 8th is a pretty good approximation.

89
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:11,449
Now within the visible light spectrum and I'll talk about

90
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,818
whats beyond the visible light spectruum in a second.

91
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:15,467
You are probablly familiar with

92
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:17,812
colors and maybe you imagine it as a colors of rainbow,

93
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:20,969
and rainbow really happen because the light from the sun,

94
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:26,840
the white light, is being refracted by these little water particles.

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,443
and you can see that in a clearer way when you see

96
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,812
light being refracted by a prism right over here.

97
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,713
and the different wavelengths of light, so white light

98
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:39,035
contains all of the visible wavelengths.

99
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:43,298
But the different wavelengths get refracted differently by a prism.

100
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:47,069
So in this case the higher frequenty wavelengths,

101
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:49,809
the violet and the blue, get refracted more, its get bent,

102
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:54,096
it's direction gets bent more than the low frequency wavelengths,

103
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:58,214
than the reds and the oranges right over here

104
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:02,765
And if you want to look at the wavelength of light,

105
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:05,366
visible light, its between 400 nanometeres and 700 nanometers.

106
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:10,149
And the higher the frequency, the higher the energy of that light.

107
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:12,378
And that actually goes into, when you start talking

108
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:13,772
about the quantuum mechanics of it.

109
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:17,446
That the higher frequency means that each of these photons have higher energy.

110
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:21,434
They have a better ability to give kinetic energy to knock off electrons,

111
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,781
or whatever else they need to do.

112
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,800
So higher frequency, let me write that down:

113
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:34,809
[HIGHER FREQUNCY means HIGHER ENERGY]

114
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:39,453
Now, I keep referring to this idea of the visible light.

115
00:06:39,453 --> 00:06:41,450
And you might say: "What is beyond visible light?"

116
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,468
And what you'll find is that light is just a part

117
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,441
of a much broader phenomenom that is just a part

118
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,066
that we happen to observe.

119
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,899
And if we want to broaden the discussion a little bit.

120
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:58,818
Visible light is just, really, part of the electromagnetic spectrum

121
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,394
So light is really just electromagentic radiation.

122
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:08,970
[Electromagnetic radiation]

123
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,147
And everything that I told you about light just now,

124
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,701
it has a wave property and it has particle properties,

125
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,812
This is not just specific to visible light.

126
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,840
This is true of all of electromagnetic radiation.

127
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,867
So at very low frequencies, or very long wavelengths,

128
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,472
we're talking about things like radio waves,

129
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:30,908
the things that allow radio to reach your car,

130
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,113
the things that allow your cell phone to

131
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,784
comunicate with cell towers.

132
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:39,964
Microwaves, the thing that start vibrating water molecules

133
00:07:39,964 --> 00:07:41,775
in your food so that they heat up.

134
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:45,133
Infrared, wich is what our body realeses and thats

135
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,487
way you can detect people through walls with infrared cameras.

136
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:51,110
Visible light... Ultraviolet light, the UV light coming

137
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,060
from the sun that'll give you sunburn.

138
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,450
X-rays! The radiation that allows us to see through

139
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,819
the soft material and just visualize the bones.

140
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,813
Gamma rays! The super high energy that comes from quasars

141
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:04,809
and other certain types of physical phenomenons.

142
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:08,803
These are all the examples of the exact same thing!

143
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:14,106
We just happen to perceive certain frequencies of this as visible light!

144
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,234
And you might say: "Hey, Sal, how come

145
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,867
we only perceive certain frequancies of this?

146
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:22,056
How come we only see these frequencies?"

147
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:22,956
And I'll put these...

148
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:26,132
Literally we can see those frequencies with our unaided eye.

149
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,426
And the reason, or at least my best guess of the reason of that is:

150
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:34,236
That's the frequency where the sun dumps out a lot of electromagnetic radiation.

151
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:37,689
So its illumating the earth, and if

152
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,732
as a species you wanted to observe things

153
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:41,400
based on reflected energy, a reflected electromagnetic energy,

154
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,398
it is most usefull to be able to perceive the things

155
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,534
where there is the most electromagnetic radiation.

156
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:51,064
So it is possible that in other realities or other plantes

157
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,989
There are species that perceive more in the ultraviolet range,

158
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:55,708
or infrared range.

159
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,379
Or even on earth there are some

160
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,376
that perform better at either end of the range.

161
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,395
But we see really well in the part of the spectrum

162
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:07,227
where the sun just happens to dump a lot of radiation on us.

163
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:11,683
Now I'll leave you there, I think that's a pretty good overview of light.

164
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:15,909
And if any of this stuff seems kind of unintuitive or

165
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:17,964
daunting or really on some level confusing

166
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:21,064
this wave-particle duality, this idea of

167
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:25,383
of transfer of energy through nothing

168
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:28,030
and it seems unintuitive: Don't worry!

169
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,269
It seems unintuitive even for the best of physicists.

170
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,703
So you're already at the leading edge of physics thinking!
