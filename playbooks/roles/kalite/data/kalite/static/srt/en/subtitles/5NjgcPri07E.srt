1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010
We are told that triangle ABC has perimeter p and inradius r

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,640
and then they want us to find the area of ABC in terms of p and r

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,080
so we know that perimeters are just the sum of the sides of the triangle

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,270
or how long of length will have to be if you wanna to go around the triangle

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,170
and let's just remind ourselves what the inradius is

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,940
if we take the angle bisectors of each of these vertexes

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,700
each of these angles right over here

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,140
so bisectors that right over there

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,330
and then bisector that right over there

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,840
this angle is going to be equal to that angle

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,590
this angle is going to be equal to that angle

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,310
and then this angle is going to be equal to that angle there

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,030
and the point where those angle bisectors intersect

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,050
that right over there is our incenter

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,210
and it is equal distant from all of the three sides

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,280
and the distance from those sides that's the inradius

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,460
so let me draw the inradius

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,250
so when you find the distance between the point and the line

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,530
you wanna drop a perpendicular

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,170
so this length right over here is the inradius

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,440
this length right over here is the inradius

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
and this length right over here is the inradius

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,910
and if you want you could draw a incircle here with the center at the incenter

24
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,690
and with the radius r and that circle would look something like this

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,180
we don't have to actually draw for this problem

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,400
so you could draw a circle that looks something like that

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,890
then we call that the incircle

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,400
so let's think about how we can find the area here

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,840
especially in terms of this inradius

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,500
well the cool thing about the inradius is this it looks like the altitude

31
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,370
well this looks like the altitude for this triangle right over here

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,570
triangle A let's label the center let's call it I for incenter

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,410
so r is this r right over here is the altitude of triangle AIC

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,770
this r is the altitude of triangle BIC

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,860
and this r which we didn't label

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,240
that r right over there is the altitude of triangle AIB

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,670
and so we could find the area of each of those triangles in terms of both r and their basis

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,140
maybe if we sum up the area of all the triangles

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,310
we can get something in terms of our perimeter and our inradius

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,990
so let's just try to do this

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,880
so the area of the entire triangle the area of ABC is going to be equal to

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,920
and I will color code this

43
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,160
this is going to be equal to the area of AIC

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,960
so that's what I am shading here in magenta is going to be euqal to the area of AIC

45
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,520
plus the area of BIC which is this triangle right over here

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,040
I will show you that in a different color I have already used blue

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,530
so let me do that in orange

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,700
plus the area of BIC so that's this area right over here

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,410
so plus the area of BIC and then finally plus the area

50
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,510
I will do this in let's see I will use this pink color

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:11,560
plus the area of AIB that is the area AIB

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,290
take the sum of the areas of these three triangles

53
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,540
you've got the area of the larger triangle

54
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,720
Now AIC the area of AIC is going to be equal to one half base times height

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,480
so this is going to be one half the basis of the length of AC one half AC

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
times the height times this altitude right over here

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,520
which is just going to be r times r

58
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,380
that's the area of AIC

59
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:43,000
and then the area of BIC is going to be one half the base which is BC

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,650
times a height which is r

61
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,960
and then plus the area of AIB this one right over here is going to be

62
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,430
one half the base which is the length of the side AB

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,200
AB times a height which is oneeagain r

64
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,900
and over here we can fetch out one half r for all of these terms

65
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:16,410
and you get one half r times AC plus BC plus AB

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,990
and I think you see where this is going

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:24,720
plus that's the different shade of pink plus AB

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Now what is AC plus BC plus AB

69
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,250
well that's going to be the perimeter p if you just take the sum of the sides

70
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,200
that is the perimeter of p and it looks like we are done

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:53,790
the area of our triangle of ABC is equal to one half times r times the perimeter

72
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,770
which is kind of a neat result

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,950
one half times the inradius times the perimeter of the triangle

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,530
or sometimes we will see it written like this is equal to r times p over s

75
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,750
oh sorry p over 2

76
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,250
and this term right over here the perimeter divided by 2

77
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:19,370
is sometimes called semi perimeter and sometimes it is denoted by s

78
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,740
so sometimes you will see the area is equal to r times s

79
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,270
where s is the semi perimeter it's the perimeter divided by 2

80
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,020
I firstly like this way a little bit more

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
because I remember that p is the perimeter

82
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,820
this is useful because obviously now if someone gives you inradius and a perimeter

83
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,760
you can figure out the area of a triangle

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,570
or someone gives you the area of the triangle and the perimeter

85
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,810
you can get the inradius of it

86
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,130
if given any two of these variables you can always get the third

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,810
so for example if someone if this was a triangle right over here

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,890
which is the most famous of the right triangles

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,480
if I have a triangle that has length 3 4 and 5

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,610
we know this is a right triangle

91
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,130
you can verify this from the pythagorean theorem

92
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,460
and someone says what is the inradius of this triangle right over here

93
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,670
well we can figure out the area pretty easily

94
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,020
we know that this is a right triangle 3 squared plus 4 squared is equal to 5 squared

95
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,490
so the area is going to be equal to 3 times 4 times one half

96
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,870
so 3 times 4 times one half is 6

97
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:26,630
and the perimeter here is going to be equal to 3 plus 4 which is 7 plus 5 is 12

98
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,910
and so we have the area so let's write this

99
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,490
the area is equal to one half times the inradius times the perimeter

100
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:44,720
so here we have 12 is equal to one half times the inradius times the perimeter

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,050
so we have oh sorry we have 6 let me write this

102
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:55,140
the area 6 6 is equal to one half times the inradius times 12

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,110
and so in this situation one half times 12 is 6

104
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,620
6 is equal to 6r divide both sides by 6 you get r is equal to 1

105
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,210
so if you want to draw the inradius for this one which is kind of a neat result

106
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,890
so let me draw some angle bisectors here

107
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,810
this 3-4-5 right triangle has inradius of 1

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,010
so this distance equals this distance which is equal to this distance

109
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,210
which is equal to 1 just kind of a neat result
