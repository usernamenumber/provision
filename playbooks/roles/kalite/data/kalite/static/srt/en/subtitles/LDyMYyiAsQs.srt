1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,940
We're on problem 138.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,870
In a certain business production
index, p is

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,810
directly proportional to
efficiency index e.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,379
So we could say that p is equal
to some proportionality

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,560
constant times e.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,590
Because they say p is directly
proportional to e.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,280
Fair enough.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,130
Which is, in turn, directly
proportional to

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,180
investment index i.

11
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,470
So e is proportional to i.

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,980
So we could say it's equal
to some proportionality

13
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,255
constant times i.

14
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,510
And actually, we could go even
a step further and say, well,

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,060
if p is proportional to e and
e is proportional to i, we

16
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,610
could also say that p is
proportional to i.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,610
Directly proportional to i.

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,100
So it might be some other
constant times i.

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,630
And you could prove that
mathematically, right?

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,010
You take this and substitute
it for e and you get p is

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,090
equal to k times e, e is equal
to some constant times i, and

22
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,920
so p is equal to kn times i.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,129
But k and n were both arbitrary
constants, so we

24
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,810
could just call that m.

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,310
So this is the information that
the problem gives us.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,240
   

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,370
p is proportional to e, e is
proportional to i, so p is

28
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,480
also proportional to i.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,170
So what are they asking us?

30
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,120
What is p if i is equal to 70?

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,450
So if we knew this proportional

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,500
constent, we'd be all set.

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,700
We could actually solve
this problem.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,280
Maybe they're going to go
through e or something, I

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
don't know.

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,520
So statement number one.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,380
e is equal to 0.5 when
e is equal to 60.

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,260
Well, we can definitely use
this information to

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,690
figure out what n is.

40
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,180
But that by itself isn't going
to help us, because we can

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,070
figure out what n is and then
once we know what n is, we can

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,970
figure out what e
is when i is 70.

43
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,490
We'll put 70 here times whatever
we figure out n is.

44
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,930
And we'll get e.

45
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,750
But without knowing what k is,
that still won't help us.

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,199
So statement one, by itself,
if I'm right, isn't right.

47
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,979
That won't help us.

48
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,180
And I'll show it to you.

49
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,560
Oh, this would be waste
of time if you

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,100
understood that logic.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,870
Because you can say 0.5 is equal
to n times 60-- this is

52
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,090
so we can solve for n-- so n
is equal to 0.5 over 60.

53
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,660
That's the same thing
as 1/120.

54
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,740
So then that equation
boils down to e is

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,990
equal to i over 120.

56
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,940
1/120 times i.

57
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,470
So when i is equal to 70, e
would be equal to 70/120,

58
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,270
which is equal to 7/12.

59
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,220
But that still doesn't
help us.

60
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,810
E is equal to 7/12, but we don't
know what k is, right?

61
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,640
When i is equal to 70, e is
7/12, so we still don't know

62
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,480
what k is based on just the
information in statement one.

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,470
So as far as I can tell
right now, one by

64
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,380
itself-- not so useful.

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,630
Statement two.

66
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,210
   

67
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,850
p is equal to 2 when
i is equal to 50.

68
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,090
Well, this is useful.

69
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,300
Because we already said,
p is proportional to i.

70
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,020
P is equal to some constant
m times i.

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,930
So we could use this information
to solve for m.

72
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,240
So p is equal to 2 when
i is equal to 50.

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,230
Divide both sides by 50, you
get m is equal to 1/25.

74
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,810
So the question was, what is
p when i is equal to 70?

75
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,430
So we could just say p is
equal to m times i.

76
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,050
Well, i now is 70.

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,760
And whatever 70 divided
by 25 is, that's p.

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,530
So statement two alone
was sufficient

79
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,570
to solve this problem.

80
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,670
And statement one didn't
help us much.

81
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,450
Next problem.

82
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,430
139.

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,750
If x does not equal minus y--
that's interesting-- is x

84
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,300
minus y over x plus
y greater than 1.

85
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,410
So why do they say x does
not equal minus 1?

86
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,090
I'm sorry. x does now
equal minus y.

87
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,500
Well, if x were equal to minus
y, if this were minus y, then

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,870
you'd have minus y plus y, the
denominator would be 0, and

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,700
you'd be undefined.

90
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,260
So maybe that's why they
put that out there.

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,400
Let's see, I think we can
simplify this statement.

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,740
So we could multiply both
sides by x plus y.

93
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,420
You get x minus y is greater
than x plus y.

94
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,580
And so this holds
true if what?

95
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,300
Let's see, we could subtract
x from both sides.

96
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,090
Subtracting x from both sides
you get-- just get rid of the

97
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,140
x's-- you get minus y
is greater than y.

98
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,710
Let's see, we could add y to
both sides of this equation.

99
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,630
So the left side, if you
add y here, you get 0.

100
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,370
If you add a y on this
side, you get 2y.

101
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,870
And then you could divide both
sides of this equation by 2.

102
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,430
And you get 0 is greater than
y, or y is less than 0.

103
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,600
Either way.

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,660
This statement is true
if, and only if, this

105
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,430
statement is true.

106
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,950
So this is really all
we need to test for.

107
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,810
Is y less than 0?

108
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,700
If we know that y is less than
0, we know that this is true.

109
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,860
Or if we know that this
is false, then we

110
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,370
know this is false.

111
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,770
So statement one.

112
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,320
Statement one tells us
x is greater than 0.

113
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,330
Well, this is useless.

114
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,496
This actually has no bearing on
whether y is less than 0.

115
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:33,450
x can be anything.

116
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,630
It doesn't change this.

117
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,020
So this by itself is useless.

118
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,830
Statement two is-- well,
there you go.

119
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,540
y is less than 0.

120
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,390
So statement two tells us this
is true and this is true if,

121
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,230
and only if, this is true.

122
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,870
So therefore, statement two
alone is sufficient to answer

123
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,300
this question.

124
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,260
Very seldom do you boil down the
statement to actually one

125
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,860
of the statements that
they provide you.

126
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,330
But that was interesting.

127
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,120
Next problem.

128
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,560
140.

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
In the rectangular coordinate
system, are the points r,s and

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,300
u,v equidistant from
the origin.

131
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,930
OK, so they're essentially
saying, is the distance of the

132
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,510
point r,s-- distance from the
origin-- equal to the

133
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,150
distance-- I'll call it d sub
o-- equal to the distance of

134
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,430
the origin of point u,v.

135
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,300
And here, just to get the
intuition of distance-- I

136
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,960
always find it silly that they
teach something called a

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,200
distance formula in high
schools, because it's really

138
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,410
just the Pythagorean theorem.

139
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,290
And by calling it something
different and making you

140
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,370
memorize a different formula,
it'll just clutter your head.

141
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,920
So this is the x-axis,
this is the y-axis.

142
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,860
The point r,s will be here.

143
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,460
This is r.

144
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,030
This is s.

145
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,510
This is the point r,s.

146
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,230
What's its distance
from the origin?

147
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,550
Well, its distance from origin
is the length of this line

148
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,360
right there.

149
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,300
What's the length of that?

150
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,650
Well, we can use Pythagorean
theorem.

151
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,810
The height right there is s.

152
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,110
The base here is r.

153
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,040
And if we call this distance,
we use Pythagorean theorum.

154
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,610
r squared plus s squared is
equal to the distance squared.

155
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,660
Or we can say that the distance
is equal to the

156
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,880
square root of r squared
plus s squared.

157
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,530
The distance to the origin.

158
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,280
So this statement up here boils
down to that the square

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,530
root of r squared plus s squared
needs to be equal to

160
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,950
the square root of u squared
plus v squared.

161
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,260
Well, just to simplify things,
let's just square both sides

162
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,460
of this equation.

163
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,630
The question they ask is, is r
squared plus s squared equal

164
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,880
to u squared plus v squared?

165
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,390
Is this true?

166
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,210
That's what they ask us.

167
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,610
And that kind of simplifies
things.

168
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,670
Makes them more concrete.

169
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,140
So let's see what the
statements give us.

170
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,270
Statement one.

171
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,290
r plus s is equal to 1.

172
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,520
   

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,180
Just off the cuff, I don't see
where that's going to be

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,290
actually useful.

175
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,400
It's not like you can just
square this. r plus s squared

176
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,880
is r squared plus 2rs
plus s squared.

177
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,630
A lot of people make the mistake
that thinking, oh, r

178
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,950
plus s squared is r squared
plus s squared.

179
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,410
No, that's not true.

180
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,280
You have to distribute all the
terms and you end up with

181
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
three terms. So that's
not right.

182
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,159
I don't see an r plus
s anywhere up here.

183
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,980
Let's try statement
number two.

184
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,960
Statement number two.

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:48,620
u is equal to 1 minus r, and
v is equal to 1 minus s.

186
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,790
So this seems like it could
be interesting.

187
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,860
Because it allows us to,
essentially, reduce this

188
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,970
question, which is a question of
four variables, and turn it

189
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,050
into a question of two variables
by substituting u

190
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,530
and v with these things.

191
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,940
So let's do that.

192
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,520
Let's turn this statement into
a statement of two variables.

193
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,450
I'll switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

194
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,840
So the left-hand side is r
squared plus s squared is

195
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
equal to u squared.

196
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Well, now they're telling us
that u squared is 1 minus r

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,725
squared-- plus v squared.

198
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,480
Well, v is 1 minus s.

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,430
1 minus s squared.

200
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,070
Let's just keep simplifying.

201
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,080
r squared plus s squared is
equal to 1 minus 2, r plus r

202
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,935
squared plus 1 minus
2s plus s squared.

203
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:43,530
Let's see, we could subtract
r squared from both sides.

204
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,660
We can subtract s squared
from both sides.

205
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:57,430
And we're left with 0 is equal
to 2 minus 2r minus 2s.

206
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,100
And let's see, we can bring the
r and the s terms over to

207
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,610
the other side.

208
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,000
So add 2r plus 2s
to both sides.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,210
So bring them over, you get
2r plus 2s is equal to 2.

210
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,320
Divide the whole thing
by 2-- both sides.

211
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,510
You get r plus s
is equal to 1.

212
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,570
Interesting.

213
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,340
So when you apply these two
constraints on our original

214
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,620
question, the question
gets reduced to this.

215
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,870
If we know that statement two is
correct, the question that

216
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,570
the problem was asking gets
reduced to this: It's saying,

217
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,900
if we know that this happens,
then the question is true if

218
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,490
this is true.

219
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,330
Well, just from statement
two alone, we don't know

220
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,130
that this is true.

221
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,240
But, as you see, statement one
tells us that that is true.

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,300
So if you use both statements
together, you know that this

223
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,290
question is correct.

224
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,460
This question is true.

225
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,520
And that was actually pretty
interesting and a little bit

226
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,270
hairier than normal.

227
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,920
Normally, you can identify
immediately just

228
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,900
by eyeballing it.

229
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,710
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
