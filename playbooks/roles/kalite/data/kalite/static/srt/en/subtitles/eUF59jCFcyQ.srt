1
00:00:01,207 --> 00:00:11,564
Right now the prevailing theory of how the Universe came about is commonly called the Big Bang Theory.

2
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:16,718
And really it's just this idea that the Universe that this Universe started as kind of an infintely small

3
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:24,067
point, this infinitely small singularity, and then it just had a Big Bang, or it just expanded from that

4
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:30,133
state to the Universe we know right now. And when I first imagined this, and I think it's also a by-product

5
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:36,897
of how its named, Big Bang, you kind of imagine this type of explosion. You kind of imagine this type

6
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:43,537
of explosion. That everything was infinitely packed in together and then it exploded. And then it exploded

7
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:51,067
outward. Then as all the matter exploded outward it started to condense and then you have all these

8
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:58,133
galaxies and super clusters of galaxies and they started to condense and then within them, planets condense

9
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:03,933
and stars condense and then we have the type of Universe that we have right now. But this model for

10
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:09,467
visualizing the Big Bang has a couple of problems. One is, when we talk about the Big Bang, we're not

11
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:15,209
talking about the matter, just the mass or just the matter in the Universe being in one point, we're

12
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:24,533
talking about actual space expanding, we are not just talking about something inside of space, like the physical mass expanding

13
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:29,443
we are talking about space itself so when you have this type of a model you have all the stuff expanding

14
00:01:29,443 --> 00:01:39,067
is it expanding into something else? Maybe if the furthest out part of this matter is right over here

15
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,733
what's this stuff over here? So you say:

16
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:47,267
wouldn't that be space, how can you say space itself is expanding?

17
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:51,851
And another idea that a Big Bang also implies is that if this is furthest stuff out there

18
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:58,867
would this be the edge of the Universe? Does the Universe have an edge?

19
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:03,533
And the answer to this question, that's why we are going to try to tackle this is,

20
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,363
one: **the Universe does not have an edge** and

21
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:10,400
two: **there is no outside space**, we are not expanding

22
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,800
into another space. I am going to explain that,

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,733
hopefully we'll see why this is the case right now.

24
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,691
So the best way of viewing it is by analogy

25
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:31,115
If I were to tell you that I have a two dimensional space

26
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:44,200
that has a finite area, so it's not infinite and also has no edge

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,467
this once again, when you first look at it, it seems difficult

28
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,800
how do I construct something that has a finite area

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,933
but still has no edge? Every time I try to draw an area it looks like I have to have some edges

30
00:02:54,933 --> 00:03:01,400
and then you might remember, what if that two dimensional space is curved?

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,204
what happens? I think that the easiest example of that is the the surface of the sphere.

32
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:13,200
let me draw a sphere over here. So this right here is a sphere.

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,343
let me draw some longitude and latitude lines on this sphere

34
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:21,619
on this sphere all of a sudden, I shade it in a little bit, make it look nice,

35
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:28,353
this type of a sphere you have a finite area, you can imagine the surface of a balloon

36
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,133
or the surface of a bubble or the surface of the Earth

37
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:36,400
you have a finite area but you have no edge, if you keep going forever in one direction

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:44,769
you just keep going all the way around and come back to the other side

39
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:51,667
now, to imagine a three dimensional space that has the same properties, a finite area and,

40
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,333
I don't want to say finite area anymore, because we are not talking about

41
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,296
a three dimensional space anymore, let me draw over here

42
00:03:57,296 --> 00:04:08,088
so let's think about three dimensional space,

43
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:18,933
and instead of area I want to talk about finite volume

44
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,316
and no edge, how do I do that?

45
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:26,467
when you think about it superficially, look, if you had finite volume it's going to be maybe

46
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:33,000
contained in some type of cube, we clearly have edges in those situations

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,067
you can even think about a finite volume as being the inside of a sphere, that clearly has an edge

48
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,543
this entire surface over there.

49
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:44,467
so how do you construct an three dimensional space that has finite volume and no edge?

50
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,133
And than I am going to tell you right now

51
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:50,000
it's very hard for us to visualize it, but in order to visualize it

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I am going to draw the same thing that I drew right here

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,944
you have to imagine it, you always have to imagine it by analogy

54
00:04:56,944 --> 00:05:04,646
(unless you have a profound brain wired for more than three spatial dimensions)

55
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:15,950
is a sphere, let me make it clear, this is two dimensional surface.

56
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,941
right on the surface of the sphere you can only move in two directions.

57
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:24,643
two perpendicular directions, you can move like that or you can move like that,

58
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:27,267
you can move left and right or you can move up and and down

59
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:33,200
two dimensional surface of a three dimensional

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:45,656
sphere, so if we take it by analogy, let's imagine, and it's hard to imagine, a three dimensional surface

61
00:05:45,656 --> 00:06:01,338
and you can do it mathematically, the math here is actually not that difficult, three dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere

62
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:02,719
and I'm going to draw up the same way,

63
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,877
so if we kind of view those three dimensions are just these two dimension of the surface

64
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:12,912
it's the same thing, and if imagine that I'm not saying this is the actual shape of the Universe,

65
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:19,971
we don't know the shape, but we do know it has a slight curvature, we don't know the actual shape

66
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,897
but the sphere is the simpliest, there's other ones we can do, a toroid

67
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:27,077
would also fit the bill, it would have a finite volume with no edge

68
00:06:27,077 --> 00:06:31,906
and I think, I want to make it clear, we actually don't know whether it has a finite volume

69
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:37,154
it's still an open question, but I want to show you it can have a finite volume and also have

70
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:46,733
no edge. And most people believe, and I want to say believe because you know we can, just go based on evidence and all that,

71
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:52,800
that we are talking about something with finite volume, especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory

72
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,467
that kind of some dimensions implies a finite volume, although it could be a super large, unfathomably large volume

73
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:07,029
it is finite, now if you have this, imagine, this sphere,

74
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:14,515
once again if you're on this surface of this four dimensional sphere, I can't draw a four dimensional sphere, but

75
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:22,874
if you are on this surface of this four dimensional sphere if you go in any direction you'll come back to where you started

76
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:27,704
if you go that way you'll come back around here, now the Universe is super huge so even light

77
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:32,301
maybe light itself would take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it

78
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:38,199
and if this sphere itself is expanding, it may be expanding so fast that light

79
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,983
might not ever be able to come back around it, but in theory if somethings were fast enough

80
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:49,267
if something were to keep going around it could actually go back to this point. Now when we talk about

81
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:53,933
a three dimensional surface it's a three dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere

82
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:58,667
that means that any of the three dimensions that are over here on the surface, I can only draw two

83
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:05,267
but that means, if this is true, if the Universe is a three dimensional surface of a four dimensional

84
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:12,263
sphere, that means if you go up and if you just keep going up, you'll eventually come back from the bottom.

85
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:19,667
So if you keep going, you keep going all the way up you'll eventually come back to the point that you where

86
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:24,067
it might be an unbelievably large distance but you'll eventually get back where you were

87
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:28,267
if you go to the right you'll eventually come back all the way around to the point where you were

88
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:34,533
and if you want to go into the page, let me draw it that way, if you go into the page

89
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:39,467
you'd eventually come back from above the page, and come back to the point that you are

90
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:43,800
so that's what this implication would be that you would actually get back to where you are

91
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,000
so let's go back to the question of and expanding Universe.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,181
You know an expanding Universe that is not expanding into any other space

93
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:53,246
it is all of the space but it is still expanding

94
00:08:53,246 --> 00:09:02,009
this is the model, so you can imagine shortly after the Big Bang, our four dimensional sphere look like this

95
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:09,467
maybe it was a little small four dimensional sphere, maybe at the Big Bang it was this little unbelievably

96
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:13,667
small sphere then a little bit later it is this larger sphere, let me just shade it in

97
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:24,959
to show that it is kind of popping out of the page this sphere, and in the later time this sphere might look like this,

98
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,736
now you temptation might be to say, well isn't this stuff outside of the sphere?

99
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,867
isn't that some type of a space that is expanding into ?

100
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:41,867
isn't that somehow part of the Universe? and I would say if you are talking in three dimension, no it's not.

101
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:48,200
The entire Universe is this surface, it is the surface of this four dimensional sphere

102
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,333
if you start talking about more dimensions, then yes, you could talk about maybe things outside of our

103
00:09:54,333 --> 00:10:00,770
three dimensional Universe, so as this expands in space-time, you know one way to view

104
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,367
this fourth dimension is that it is time itself, things are just getting further and further apart.

105
00:10:05,367 --> 00:10:11,544
And I'll talk about the evidence in future videos for why the Big Bang is the best theory

106
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:16,467
we have out there right now. But as you can imagine, if you have two points on this sphere that are that

107
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:22,690
far apart, as this sphere expands, this four dimensional sphere, this bubble, blows up, or this balloon

108
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:29,052
blows up, those two points; let me draw three points, those three points are just going to get further

109
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:37,457
and further apart, that's actually one of the main points that, one of the first reasons why it makes

110
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:41,451
sense to believe in the Big Bang is that everything is expanding not from some central point, but everything

111
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:46,792
is expanding from everything, that if you go in any direction from any point in the Universe, everything else

112
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:52,667
is expanding away and the further away you go it looks like the faster it's expanding away from you,

113
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:58,077
so I'll leave there it's something for you to think about a little bit, and then we'll build on some of this

114
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:02,077
to think about what it means to observe the observable Universe.
