99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this video we will see how to synthesize alcohols using a grignard reagent.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so first we have to learn how to make a grignard reagent

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you start with an alkyl halide over here on the left and you add

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
magnesium metal and you need to add something like

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
diethyl ether. you can't have any water present

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because water will react with the grignard reagent. And so this is

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what you make over here on the right, you end up with a carbon atom bonded to

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a metal, so carbon is bonded to magnesium. This is called an organo

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
organo-metallic bond. And you can do this with other metals.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can do this with lithium for example, but Grignard reagents are

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one of those things that are always talked about in undergraduate organic chemistry class

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you can see that these two electrons here, these red ones,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I've drawn it like a covalent bond, a bond between carbon and

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
magnesium, but in reality it is more ionic

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than covalent, so it is equivalent to this second structure down here

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now in terms of electronegativities, carbon is actually more electronegative than

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than magnesium, so the two electrons in red

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are actually going ot be closer to the carbon atom itself, giving the carbon

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a negative charge and forming a carbanion

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is a carbanion that is formed. And this is unique

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because this carbanion can now act as a nucleophile

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in your mechanism to make alcohols, so this is the preparation

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a Grignard reagent, it's proved to be a very very useful thing.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in organic synthesis, so much so that Grignard won the nobel prize

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for his research into this chemistry.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's take a look at the mechanism to form a Grignard reagent.
