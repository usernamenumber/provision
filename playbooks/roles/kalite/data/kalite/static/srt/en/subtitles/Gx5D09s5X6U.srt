00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:06,711
Snakes, lots and lots of snakes. These snakes are just writing with potential.

2
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:12,312
Similar parts linked together, they move in a specific and limited way. Part of the potential of things

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,160
is how they break, these snakes break fantastically into these snake modules. You can put them back together

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,109
too, allowing the existence of the super snake. Super snakes are obviously desirable for many reasons,

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,073
besides being inherently awesome, you can wear them and put them on things and drop them which I find

6
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:33,202
amusing for some reason. You can arrange them into a space-filling fractal curve if that's what you like.

7
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:38,474
Which I do. You can even jump snake. But let's not forget you can make mini snakes too.

8
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:42,655
Which enables the snake-stache, and starting from mini snake gives you room to grow.

9
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:50,838
[snakex12] They like to bend into this angle, who cares what it actually is besides about 90 degrees

10
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:55,242
but it begs the question, how many ways can I fold this snake if it has 10 segments?

11
00:00:55,242 --> 00:01:04,636
I can notate the way it slithers back and forth from tail to head. I'm gonna call this string of letters

12
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:11,776
a slither. This is a valid slither, this is an invalid one. Since anyone who's played snake knows that

13
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:16,138
a snake isn't allowed to run into itself. Given a slither, how can I tell whether it's-

14
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:21,247
Of course snake lets you go straight too, so you can do another version of this that allows going straight

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,540
and notate it like this and wonder whether this snake is a loser snake or not.

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:33,460
[snakex16] Don't forget to try putting the snake modules together in ways they were never meant to go.

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,339
You can mix colours, so in theory I could be hiding a secret message in the colour pattern of this snake.

18
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:43,027
But I'm not, because I'm lazy so it's just the digits of the binary expansion of pi.

19
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:47,392
Even better you can attach more than one segment at a point, I can have a two-headed serpent.

20
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:52,129
I can play the game where I cut off the heads of a hydra, adding two more in the old head's place.

21
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:57,442
And see how far that gets me. I can put the snake modules on my fingertips and have snakey fingers.

22
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:02,067
That's cool too. I can even do super snakey fingers. [snakex5]

23
00:02:02,067 --> 99:59:59,999
