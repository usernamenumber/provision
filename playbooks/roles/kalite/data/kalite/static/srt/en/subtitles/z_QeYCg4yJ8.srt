1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,200
Both of the major parties -- and we're talking about the United States here --

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,333
hold a national convention during the summer before the actual general election.

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:15,733
So the Republicans will hold their Republican national convention,

4
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:19,333
and the Democrats will hold their Democratic national convention.

5
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,267
And it's there that they will choose their official candidates

6
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:25,800
that will run against each other in the general election.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,267
And a national convention for one of the parties

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:32,800
will look something like this.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
This is the Democratic national convention in 2008.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
You have all the delegates over here,

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,600
and everyone's all excited and they start to cheer lead for their party.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,533
and for their candidate the republican national convetion

13
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,333
looks very similar

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:49,333
And although there's a lot of energy here there actually isn't a lot of suspense

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:53,533
Going into the convention we usually know already who

16
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,733
the candidates for each of the parties are going to be

17
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:00,933
And that's because each of the states have their own selection process

18
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,533
for picking a candidate

19
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:07,667
As we get the results from we know how many delegates

20
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,667
they're going to send to the convetion

21
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,267
and who(m) they're going to vote for

22
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:17,267
But there's two ways they can select those candidates

23
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,200
or those delegates at the national convention

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:31,667
They could either run a caucus

25
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:37,267
or they could run a primary

26
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,267
And I'll start with primary because that's a little more intuitive

27
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,400
It's kind of like just a election that is based on party

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
for whom do you want to be your nominee

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,667
at coming out of the convention

30
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,933
So for any given state they will have both a

31
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:55,800
Democratic primary and a Republican primary

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,333
And on the democratic primary let's say candidate A gets

33
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,600
40% of the votes on that election

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Candidate B gets 30% of the votes

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
and let's say candidate C gets another 30%

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,600
What will happen is is that state's delegates on the democratic side

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
So let's say that that state just for convenience

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Let's say they have ten delegates

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,133
On the democratic side, that means that these delegates

40
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,533
will go on to the national convention and represent

41
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,133
the different candidates proportionally

42
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,733
So out of these ten delegates 40% or four will represent candidate A

43
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,133
Three will represent candidate B

44
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:39,733
and three will represent candidate C when they go to the national convention

45
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,533
On the republican side it's a little bit more nuance

46
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,867
you could have similar results

47
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,533
A gets 40%

48
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:51,533
B gets 30% and C gets - now let me do different letters

49
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,133
so these aren't the same candidates

50
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,533
Let me do candidates D, E and F

51
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,733
So you could have candidate D, candidate E, candidate F

52
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:02,533
and let's say - let me do the percentages slightly different

53
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,333
for fun

54
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,933
So let's he has 45% over here

55
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,533
let's say he has 25% over here

56
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:12,533
and then let's say you have candidate F with 30% over here

57
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,533
On the republican side it depends from state to state

58
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:19,133
Some states will do it similar to the democrats

59
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,933
where the delegates represent the candidates proportion to

60
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:23,867
the votes they have

61
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,533
While some other states have it 'winner take all'

62
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:30,933
And so for example in a winner take all state, candidate D

63
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,333
will get all 10 delegates

64
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,067
And the reason why states do that is it's a stronger incentive for candidates

65
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,867
to show up to that state if they feel like their in the running

66
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:43,667
Because if they throw enough money and marketing in that state, that's a big deal to take all of the

67
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,267
votes.

68
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,467
On the other hand, if you're a smaller candidate and you don't think you

69
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,667
can take it all, it may be a disincentive for you to even show up to that state

70
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,667
and you might want to focus on the states where you can actually get

71
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,400
some delegates

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
So that's all the primary is.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's really a- you can kind of view it as an election

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,600
That sell separately on the democratic side, separately on the republican side

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,200
an those are used by the state's parties to decide which delegates go to the national party

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,933
and whom those delegates are going to vote for

77
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:15,000
A caucus, the point is the same thing

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,600
To figure out who are your delegates that are going to go

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,933
to the national convention and whom are they going to vote for

80
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,200
but the process is a little bit different

81
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,400
In a caucus, you essentially have- people get together

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,800
in these events, these caucuses in different in these events,

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
these caucuses in different precincts,

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
and the most famous of these are the Iowa caucuses

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,600
So in small precincts you'll have groups of fifty to a hundred

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,800
people get together, and the different parties will have different

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,733
ways of going about it

88
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:49,133
but they have processes in place where people try to market for different candidates

89
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:55,867
they campaign for different candidates

90
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,133
and sometimes they'll have a cut-off that if one of the candidates

91
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:03,133
at one of the precincts don't get at least 15% of the votes

92
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:06,933
then those people who supported that candidate will have to give their

93
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,133
support to another candidate they make sure that all of the delegates

94
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,667
represent at least a certain threshold of voters but there's different

95
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,467
processes in place

96
00:05:15,467 --> 00:05:19,467
But the bottom line is that at each of these pre-syncs they'll select delegates

97
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:25,067
and then those delegates will then go on to the county conventions

98
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:29,600
and then those delegates at the county conventions now these are

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,400
representing more people

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,600
will then pick delegates to the district conventions and then at the

101
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,400
district conventions they will pick candidates to the state conventions

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,600
and at the state conventions they will pick the final candidates

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,800
that will go on to the national convention

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,800
No the two most famous caucuses or primaries are the Iowa caucus

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,600
which takes place in Iowa

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,600
You have the New Hampshire primary which of course takes place in New Hampshire

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,133
And they are important not because they pick so many delegates that those delegates

108
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,133
will tip the balance necessarily

109
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:08,067
These are small states they don't have that many delegates compared to

110
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,533
California or Texas or Florida

111
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,533
but what's important about both of them is that they happen

112
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,133
very very very early on in the primary season

113
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:18,533
and because they happen early on in the primary season

114
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:22,933
the candidates that come off with the lead here it is easier for them to raise money

115
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:27,133
they say 'Oh I want to give my money to a winner, you know I don't want to give

116
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:31,533
it to a candidate who is just going to blow it and lose the money and lose the election

117
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,333
regardless'

118
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:36,133
So it gives you that. It also gives a big signal for who's a front runner because

119
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:42,467
there tends to be dynamics for whoever wins or comes in in second place in the Iowa or

120
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:47,267
New Hampshire primary that those are the people that everyone should pay attention to

121
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:50,267
they get more fundraising it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

122
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,667
More people all of a sudden take a serious look at them

123
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:56,267
Now the Iowa caucus just to be clear

124
00:06:56,267 --> 00:07:00,867
the primaries all happen in one day and you get the one, the polling results

125
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,800
when people exit the polls and you also get the final result pretty quickly

126
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,267
This caucus process actually takes place over many many months

127
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,400
five months in the case of the Iowa caucus

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,600
And the result, the thing that the press focuses on is not this final result,

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,800
of who are the actual delegates that go to the national convention

130
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,333
The thing that the press focuses on are the precinct convention where people get together

131
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:32,333
Because coming out of those precinct conventions the state parties get the information

132
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,533
on how many candidates each delegates won going into now the county convention

133
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:42,133
And this, this is the indicator that the press and the media and everyone else likes to use

134
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:47,333
to see who's a front runner in that specific party's primary

135
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,533
And the reason why the Iowa caucus in particular gets so much importance is

136
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,933
because it is the first caucus

137
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:56,133
These results come out before anything else

138
00:07:56,133 --> 00:08:00,133
The New Hampshire primary this is the first time that you have direct voting for candidates

139
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,333
so you're getting I guess getting a more direct number or your not having it

140
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,733
distorted or maybe cleaned up depending on how you view it

141
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,733
by all of the different processes that might take place within the precinct convention
