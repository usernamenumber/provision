1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,630
Now that you've been introduced
into some of the other

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,665
functions that we can take a
derivative of, we can now

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,700
apply them using the chain
and the product rule.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,770
So let's do some
fun derivatives.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,750
And I think derivatives is
all about exposure, it's

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,690
all about practice.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,780
So I just encourage you to do
as much practice as possible.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,540
And it's actually in some ways
a pretty mechanical thing to do

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,190
and it's easier than a lot of
the math that you've

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,740
learned before.

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,360
Just maybe initially
looks a little abstract.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:37,590
So let's say that f of x is
equal to let's say the sin

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,910
of 3x to the fifth plus 2x.

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,520
So what is f prime of x?

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,940
What is the derivative
of this function?

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,410
Well, we use the
chain rule again.

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,860
We take the derivative
of the inside.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,140
So what's the derivative
of the inside?

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:03,800
Well, that's just 5 times 3 is
15 x to the fourth plus 2.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,100
And then we take the derivative
of the larger function.

21
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,030
In the last presentation
we learned the derivative

22
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,700
of sin is what?

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,600
It's cosine.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,370
So it's times the cosine of
this expression right here.

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,010
3x to the fifth plus 2x.

26
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,330
Pretty painless, no?

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,380
Let's mix it up even more.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,030
Let's say that-- let me
switch colors just to

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,700
not be monotonous.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,290
I'll pick powder blue.

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,530
Very nice.

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,450
Let's say that y-- and I'm
going to switch notation on

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,700
purpose that you get used to
the various notations

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,150
you can use.

35
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,310
Let's say that y is equal to--
let me think of something

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:59,580
good-- e to the x times
cosine to the fifth of x.

37
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,460
That looks daunting to me.

38
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,570
Let's see if we can break
it down using the product

39
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,550
and the chain rules.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,760
We want to figure out dy/dx.

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,740
We want to figure out
the rate at which y

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,680
changes relative to x.

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,500
Or the derivative.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,750
Find the derivative
of both sides.

45
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,800
Well, let's use
the product rule.

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,830
Well, we're going to have
to use the chain and

47
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,130
the product rules.

48
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,060
So first we take the derivative
of this first term, and once

49
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,320
again we learned in the last
presentation the most amazing

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,070
fact, one of the most amazing
facts in the universe that the

51
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,670
derivative of e to
the x is what?

52
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,480
It is e to the x.

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,490
Blows my mind.

54
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,330
e to the x.

55
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,560
Once again I've taken the
derivative, and it's

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,720
the same expression.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,050
Amazing.

58
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,070
And then I multiply it
times a second expression.

59
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,420
Cosine to the fifth of x.

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,800
And now to that I add
the derivative of the

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,730
second expression.

62
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,500
Now this will be a little
bit more interesting.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,150
So this is cosine
of x to the fifth.

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,780
This is just another way
of writing cosine of

65
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,310
x to the fifth power.

66
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,930
And I think that'll make it a
little bit more clear, that

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,050
this cosine superscript
5, this is really just

68
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,120
cosine to the fifth x.

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,980
This means cosine
of x to the fifth.

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,730
So now the derivative is
a little bit clearer.

71
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,750
We can use the chain rule--
and once again, we're just

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,270
working on this right half.

73
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,060
We take the derivative
of the inside.

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,480
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,760
Yep you're right.

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,230
Well, I don't know, I didn't
hear you so I don't know.

77
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,175
I'll assume you're right.

78
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,070
The derivative of cosine of x
is minus sin of x, and that's

79
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,526
something you should memorize,
although you should prove

80
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,085
it to yourself as well.

81
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:39,360
So we take the derivative
of the inside minus sin.

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
Derivative of cosine of x is
minus sin of x, and then we

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,900
take the derivative
of the outside.

84
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,220
We're just doing
the chain rule.

85
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,190
So it's 5 cosine to
the fourth of x.

86
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,640
So there we took the derivative
of this piece, and then we have

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,830
to multiply times
this first piece.

88
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,340
So that times e to the x.

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,130
Interesting.

90
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,230
You can simplify this if you
want, but you get the point.

91
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,030
I mean simplifying it from
this point is really

92
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,460
just kind of algebra.

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,990
And I think you get the idea.

94
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,590
Actually everything
we're doing is algebra.

95
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,340
If you realize it looks like
something fairly complicated,

96
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,870
but we just use the chain
and the product rules.

97
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,850
Let's do some more.

98
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,600
I will now switch to magenta.

99
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,260
We want to take the derivative
dy/dx of-- let's see,

100
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,300
some big expression.

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,570
let me do something creative.

102
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:49,920
Let's say the natural log
of x over 3x plus 10.

103
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,500
So the natural log of
x over 3x plus 10.

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,470
So you could use the quotient
rule if you took the time to

105
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,770
memorize it, which I've never
taught you because it's really

106
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,550
just the product rule.

107
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,240
So I like to just rewrite
this as the product rule.

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,310
So they're the same thing.

109
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,280
Once again we're taking the
derivative, so I'm not going to

110
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,830
keep rewriting this, but this
is the same thing as taking the

111
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:21,825
derivative of the natural log
of x times 3x plus ten to

112
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,700
the negative 1 power.

113
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,695
3x plus 10 in the denominator
is the same thing as 1 over 3x

114
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,720
plus 10, which is the same
thing as 3x plus 10 to

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,990
the negative 1 power.

116
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,610
Now we can use the combination
of the product and the

117
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,800
chain rules, and we
can solve this sucker.

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,160
So let's do it.

119
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,150
So we take the derivative of
this first term the natural log

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,142
of x-- and we learned in the
last presentation the

121
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:49,330
derivative of the natural log
of x is 1/x, which is

122
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,980
pretty cool in of itself.

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,560
And we multiply that
times a second term.

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,480
So time 3x plus 10 to
the negative 1 power.

125
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,270
And to that we add the
derivative of the second term,

126
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,430
and we're going to multiply
that times the first term.

127
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,370
So first we're going to have
to use the chain rule.

128
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,710
We take the derivative
of the inside.

129
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,800
Well the derivative of
the inside's easy.

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,990
The derivative of 3x x plus 10.

131
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,900
That's just 3.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,750
And then we take the derivative
of the whole thing,

133
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,010
so it's negative 1.

134
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,930
That's 3 times negative
1 times that whole

135
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,340
expression to the minus 2.

136
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,800
3x plus 10.

137
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,420
And of course this whole thing
times the natural log of x.

138
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,980
We could simplify that.

139
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,290
Let's see.

140
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,170
This is 1/x and 3x plus
10 to negative 1.

141
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:48,090
So we could rewrite this
as 1 over x 3x plus 10.

142
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,200
Let's see.

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,550
Plus 3 times minus 1.

144
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,808
So we could say that's the
same thing as minus 3 ln of

145
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:03,910
x over 3x plus 10 squared.

146
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,620
I think you see how I
got from here to here.

147
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,180
I just manipulated the
exponents and multiplied some

148
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,760
numbers, et cetera, et cetera.

149
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,080
Let's do one more.

150
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,250
Just hit the point home.

151
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,710
You really have the tools now
at your disposal to do a

152
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,180
lot of derivative problems.

153
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,640
Probably most of the derivative
problems you'll face in the

154
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,770
first 1/2 year of calculus.

155
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,870
I'm going to switch to green.

156
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's say y-- actually
I'm tired of y.

157
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:44,550
Let's say that p is equal
to-- I don't know.

158
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:51,510
Sin of x over cosine of x.

159
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,996
Let's figure out what dp/dx.

160
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,110
The rate at which
p changes to x.

161
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,510
So once again this is the same
thing as sin of x times cosine

162
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,600
of x to the negative 1.

163
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,140
So we can just do the
product and chain rules.

164
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,200
So the derivative
of the first term.

165
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,370
Derivative of sin of x
is cosine of x, times

166
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,990
the second term.

167
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,270
Times cosine of x
to the minus 1.

168
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,560
And then to that we add the
derivative of the second term.

169
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,460
We have to use the
chain real here.

170
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,590
So we take the derivative
of the inside.

171
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,070
Well derivative of cosine
x is minus sin of x.

172
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,910
And then times the
derivative of the outside.

173
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:46,580
well that's minus 1 cosine of x
to the minus 2, and then we

174
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,810
multiply that times the
first term, sin of x.

175
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,890
So let's simplify that.

176
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,080
So this is cosine of x
divided by cosine of x.

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
You see how this cancels out?

178
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,830
This is cosine of x over cosine
of x, so this is equal to 1.

179
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,160
Cosine of x divided
cosine of x is 1.

180
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,830
And then this minus sin cancels
out with this minus sin, and

181
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,165
we have sin times sin
over cosine squared.

182
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,480
So this is equal to 1.

183
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,440
I'm going kind of fast because
I'm about to run out of time,

184
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
but I think you get
what I'm doing.

185
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,470
So this is sin squared x over
cosine squared x, which

186
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,430
is actually equal to--
what's sin over cosine?

187
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,800
1 plus tan squared x.

188
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
And if you know your trig
identities, that equals 1

189
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,980
over cosine squared of x.

190
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,890
And, of course, what we just
proved is that the derivative

191
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,200
of the tangent of x is equal
to the secant squared of x.

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,930
I hope I thoroughly confused
you in that last problem.

193
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,730
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
