1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,510
I have this matrix A here that I
want to put into reduced row

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,450
echelon form.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,160
And we've done this
multiple times.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,670
You just perform a bunch
of row operations.

6
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,470
But what I want to show you in
this video is that those row

7
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,520
operations are equivalent to
linear transformations on the

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,450
column vectors of A.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,490
So let me show you by example.

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,450
So if we just want to put A into
reduced row echelon form,

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,860
the first step that we might
want to do if we wanted to

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,580
zero out these entries right
here, is-- let me do it right

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,890
here-- is we'll keep our
first entry the same.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,830
So for each of these column
vectors, we're going to keep

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,010
the first entry the same.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,590
So they're going to be
1, minus 1, minus 1.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,360
And actually, let me
simultaneously construct my

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,800
transformation.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,340
So I'm saying that my row
operation I'm going to perform

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,690
is equivalent to a linear
transformation

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,630
on the column vector.

22
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,160
So it's going to be a
transformation that's going to

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,880
take some column vector,
a1, a2, and a3.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,130
It's going to take each of these
and then do something to

25
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,239
them, do something to them
in a linear way.

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,330
They'll be linear
transformations.

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,470
So we're keeping the
first entry of our

28
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,090
column vector the same.

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,670
So this is just going
to be a1.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,330
This is a line right here.

31
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,250
That's going to be a1.

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,050
Now, what can we do if
we want to get to

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,780
reduced row echelon form?

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,610
We'd want to make
this equal to 0.

35
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,360
So we would want to replace our
second row with the second

36
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,230
row plus the first row, because
then these guys would

37
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,500
turn out to be 0.

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,140
So let me write that on
my transformation.

39
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,490
I'm going to replace the second
row with the second row

40
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,090
plus the first row.

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,400
Let me write it out here.

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,410
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

43
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,810
2 plus minus 1 is 1.

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,950
3 plus minus 1 is 2.

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,070
Now, we also want
to get a 0 here.

46
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,360
So let me replace my third
row with my third row

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,900
minus my first row.

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,320
So I'm going to replace my third
row with my third row

49
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,690
minus my first row.

50
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,240
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,660
1 minus minus 1 is 2.

52
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,100
4 minus minus 1 is 5,
just like that.

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,790
So you see this was just a
linear transformation.

54
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,390
And any linear transformation
you could actually represent

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,280
as a matrix vector product.

56
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,140
So for example, this
transformation, I could

57
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,150
represent it.

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,230
To figure out its transformation
matrix, so if

59
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,600
we say that T of x is equal to,
I don't know, let's call

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,220
it some matrix S times x.

61
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,740
We already used the matrix A.

62
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,110
So I have to pick
another letter.

63
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,160
So how do we find S?

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,570
Well, we just apply the
transformation to all of the

65
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,370
column vectors, or the standard
basis vectors of the

66
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,240
identity matrix.

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,460
So let's do that.

68
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,760
So the identity matrix-- I'll
draw it really small like

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,080
this-- the identity matrix looks
like this, 1, 0, 0, 0,

70
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,900
1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,880
That's what that identity
matrix looks like.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,580
To find the transformation
matrix, we just apply this guy

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,660
to each of the column
vectors of this.

74
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,286
So what do we get?

75
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,270
I'll do it a little
bit bigger.

76
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,140
We apply it to each of
these column vectors.

77
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,370
But we see the first row
always stays the same.

78
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,250
So the first row is always going
to be the same thing.

79
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,850
So 1, 0, 0.

80
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm essentially applying it
simultaneously to each of

81
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,290
these column vectors, saying,
look, when you transform each

82
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,710
of these column vectors, their
first entry stays the same.

83
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,890
The second entry becomes
the second entry

84
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:32,910
plus the first entry.

85
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,730
So 0 plus 1 is 1.

86
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,510
1 plus 0 is 1.

87
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,350
0 plus 0 is 0.

88
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,440
Then the third entry gets
replaced with the third entry

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,690
minus the first entry.

90
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,660
So 0 minus 1 is minus 1.

91
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,500
0 minus 0 is 0.

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,930
1 minus 0 is 1.

93
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,510
Now notice, when I apply this
transformation to the column

94
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,010
vectors of our identity matrix,
I essentially just

95
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,760
performed those same
row operations

96
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,730
that I did up there.

97
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,160
I performed those exact same
row operations on this

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,330
identity matrix.

99
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,520
But we know that this is
actually the transformation

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,110
matrix, that if we multiply
it by each of these column

101
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,769
vectors, or by each of these
column vectors, we're going to

102
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,430
get these column vectors.

103
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,240
So you can view it this way.

104
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,990
This right here, this
is equal to S.

105
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,510
This is our transformation
matrix.

106
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,350
So we could say that if we
create a new matrix whose

107
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,320
columns are S times this column
vector, S times 1,

108
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,420
minus 1, 1.

109
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:47,540
And then the next column is S
times-- I wanted to do it in

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,670
that other color-- S times
this guy, minus 1, 2, 1.

111
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:02,930
And then the third column is
going to be S times this third

112
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:09,180
column vector, minus 1, 3, 4.

113
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,950
We now know we're applying this
transformation, this is

114
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,920
S, times each of these
column vectors.

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,890
That is the matrix
representation of this

116
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,630
transformation.

117
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,300
This guy right here will
be transformed

118
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,070
to this right here.

119
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,580
Let me do it down here.

120
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,670
I wanted to show that stuff that
I had above here as well.

121
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,310
Well, I'll just draw an arrow.

122
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,440
That's probably the
simplest thing.

123
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,900
This matrix right here
will become that

124
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,430
matrix right there.

125
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,610
So another way you could
write it, this is

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,570
equivalent to what?

127
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,520
What is this equivalent to?

128
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,900
When you take a matrix and you
multiply it times each of the

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,400
column vectors, when you
transform each of the column

130
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,970
vectors by this matrix, this
is the definition of a

131
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,270
matrix-matrix product.

132
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,440
This is equal to our matrix S--
I'll do it in pink-- this

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,920
is equal to our matrix S, which
is 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,

134
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:15,790
minus 1, 0, 1, times our matrix
A, times 1, minus 1, 1,

135
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:22,090
minus 1, 2, 1, minus 1, 3, 4.

136
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,630
So let me make this
very clear.

137
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,430
This is our transformation
matrix S.

138
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,440
This is our matrix A.

139
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,130
And when you perform this
product you're going to get

140
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,720
this guy right over here.

141
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,450
I'll just copy and paste it.

142
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,230
Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.

143
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,210
You're going to get that
guy just like that.

144
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,480
Now the whole reason why I'm
doing that is just to remind

145
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,710
you that when we perform each of
these row operations, we're

146
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,600
just multiplying.

147
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,170
We're performing a linear
transformation on each of

148
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,090
these columns.

149
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,730
And it is completely equivalent
to just multiplying

150
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,790
this guy by some matrix S.

151
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,710
In this case, we took the
trouble of figuring out what

152
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,150
that matrix S is.

153
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,550
But any of these row operations
that we've been

154
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,300
doing, you can always represent
them by a matrix

155
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,550
multiplication.

156
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,060
   

157
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,045
So this leads to a very
interesting idea.

158
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,650
   

159
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,700
When you put something in
reduced row echelon form, let

160
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,950
me do it up here.

161
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,730
   

162
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,180
Actually, let's just finish what
we started with this guy.

163
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,230
Let's put this guy in reduced
row echelon form.

164
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,440
   

165
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,080
Let me call this first S.

166
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,400
Let's call that S1.

167
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,730
So this guy right here
is equal to that

168
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,050
first S1 times A.

169
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,580
We already showed that
that's true.

170
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,040
Now let's perform another
transformation.

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,170
Let's just do another set of
row operations to get us to

172
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,000
reduced row echelon form.

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,860
So let's keep our middle
row the same, 0, 1, 2.

174
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,190
And let's replace the first row
with the first row plus

175
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,630
the second row, because I
want to make this a 0.

176
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,980
So 1 plus 0 is 1.

177
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,310
Let me do it in another color.

178
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,810
Minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

179
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,620
Minus 1 plus 2 is 1.

180
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:21,640
Now, I want to replace the third
row with, let's say the

181
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,210
third row minus 2 times
the first row.

182
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,300
So that's 0 minus 2,
times 0, is 0.

183
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,820
2 minus 2, times 1, is 0.

184
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,350
5 minus 2, times 2, is 1.

185
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,130
5 minus 4 is 1.

186
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,549
We're almost there.

187
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,870
We just have to zero out
these guys right there.

188
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,220
Let's see if we can get this
into reduced row echelon form.

189
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,900
So what is this?

190
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,880
I just performed another
linear transformation.

191
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,800
Actually, let me write this.

192
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,710
Let's say if this was our first
linear transformation,

193
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,390
what I just did is I performed
another linear

194
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,660
transformation, T2.

195
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,940
I'll write it in a different
notation, where you give me

196
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,100
some vector, some column
vector, x1, x2, x3.

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,650
What did I just do?

198
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,390
What was the transformation
that I just performed?

199
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,380
My new vector, I made the top
row equal to the top row plus

200
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,325
the second row.

201
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,690
So it's x1 plus x2.

202
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,500
I kept the second
row the same.

203
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,580
And then the third row, I
replaced it with the third row

204
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,920
minus 2 times the second row.

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,290
That was a linear transformation
we just did.

206
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,450
And we could represent this
linear transformation as

207
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,300
being, we could say T2 applied
to some vector x is equal to

208
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,120
some transformation vector
S2, times our vector x.

209
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,140
   

210
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,340
Because if we applied this
transformation matrix to each

211
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,590
of these columns, it's
equivalent to multiplying this

212
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,940
guy by this transformation
matrix.

213
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,430
So you could say that this guy
right here-- we haven't

214
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,270
figured out what this is, but
I think you get the idea--

215
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,200
this matrix right here is going
to be equal to this guy.

216
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,310
It's going to be equal
to S2 times this guy.

217
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,670
What is this guy right here?

218
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,805
Well, this guy is equal
to S1 times A.

219
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:12,510
It's going to be S2
times S1, times A.

220
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,760
Fair enough.

221
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,930
   

222
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,200
And you could have gotten
straight here if you just

223
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,940
multiplied S2 times S1.

224
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,250
This could be some
other matrix.

225
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,610
If you just multiplied it by
A, you'd go straight from

226
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,070
there to there.

227
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,670
Fair enough.

228
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,595
Now, we still haven't gotten
this guy into reduced row

229
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,010
echelon form.

230
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,220
So let's try to get there.

231
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,125
I've run out of space below
him, so I'm going

232
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,270
to have to go up.

233
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,520
So let's go upwards.

234
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,620
   

235
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,650
What I want to do is, I'm going
to keep the third row

236
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,790
the same, 0, 0, 1.

237
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,700
Let me replace the second row
with the second row minus 2

238
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,150
times the third row.

239
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,680
So we'll get a 0, we'll get a 1
minus 2, times 0, and we'll

240
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,250
get a 2 minus 2, times 1.

241
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,100
So that's a 0.

242
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,500
Let's replaced the first
row with the first row

243
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,280
minus the third row.

244
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,970
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

245
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,880
0 minus 0 is 0.

246
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,310
1 minus 1 is 0, just
like that.

247
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,470
Let's just actually write what
our transformation was.

248
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,686
Let's call it T3.

249
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:26,490
I'll do it in purple.

250
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,225
T3 is the transformation of some
vector x-- let me write

251
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:34,710
it like this-- of some
vector x1, x2, x3.

252
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,570
   

253
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,290
What did we do?

254
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,050
We replaced the first row with
the first row minus the third

255
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,300
row, x1 minus x3.

256
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,580
We replaced the second row with
the second row minus 2

257
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,970
times the third row.

258
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,870
So it's x2 minus 2 times x3.

259
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,960
Then the third row just
stayed the same.

260
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,510
So obviously, this could
also be represented.

261
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,840
T3 of x could be equal to some
other transformation matrix,

262
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,230
S3 times x.

263
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,040
So this transformation, when
you multiply it to each of

264
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,090
these columns, is equivalent to
multiplying this guy times

265
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,910
this transformation matrix,
which we haven't found yet.

266
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,560
We can write it.

267
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,430
So this is going to be equal to
S3 times this matrix right

268
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:27,150
here, which is S2, S1, A.

269
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,330
And what do we have here?

270
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,000
We got the identity matrix.

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,070
We put it in reduced
row echelon form.

272
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,580
We got the identity matrix.

273
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,530
We already know from previous
videos the reduced row echelon

274
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,750
form of something is the
identity matrix.

275
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,830
Then we are dealing with an
invertible transformation, or

276
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,140
an invertible matrix.

277
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,350
Because this obviously could be
the transformation for some

278
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,580
transformation.

279
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,670
Let's just call this
transformation, I don't know,

280
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,970
did I already use T?

281
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,420
Let's just call it Tnaught for
our transformation applied to

282
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,130
some vector x, that might
be equal to Ax.

283
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,390
So we know that this
is invertible.

284
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,170
We put it in reduced
row echelon form.

285
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,850
We put its transformation
matrix in

286
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,560
reduced row echelon form.

287
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,130
And we got the identity
matrix.

288
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,880
So that tells us that
this is invertible.

289
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,990
But something even more
interesting happened.

290
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,130
We got here by performing
some row operations.

291
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,620
And we said those row operations
were completely

292
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,080
equivalent to multiplying this
guy right here by multiplying

293
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,890
our original transformation
matrix by a series of

294
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,080
transformation matrices that
represent our row operations.

295
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,150
And when we multiplied all this,
this was equal to the

296
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,990
identity matrix.

297
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,930
Now, in the last video we said
that the inverse matrix, so if

298
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,450
this is Tnaught, Tnaught inverse
could be represented--

299
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,850
it's also a linear
transformation-- It can be

300
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,450
represented by some inverse
matrix that we just called A

301
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,070
inverse times x.

302
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,610
And we saw that the inverse
transformation matrix times

303
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,580
our transformation matrix is
equal to the identity matrix.

304
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,540
We saw this last time.

305
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,060
We proved this to you.

306
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,710
Now, something very
interesting here.

307
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,750
We have a series of matrix
products times this guy, times

308
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,010
this guy, that also got me
the identity matrix.

309
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,640
So this guy right here, this
series of matrix products,

310
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,750
this must be the same thing as
my inverse matrix, as my

311
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,170
inverse transformation matrix.

312
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,720
And so we could actually
calculate it if we wanted to.

313
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,100
Just like we did, we actually
figured out what S1 was.

314
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,560
We did it down here.

315
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,520
We could do a similar operation
to figure out what

316
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,370
S2 was, S3 was, and then
multiply them all out.

317
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,810
We would have actually
constructed A inverse.

318
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,240
I guess, something more
interesting we could do

319
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,820
instead of doing that, what if
we applied these same matrix

320
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,020
products to the identity
matrix.

321
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,370
So the whole time we did
here, when we did

322
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,950
our first row operation.

323
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,500
So we have here, we
have the matrix A.

324
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,120
Let's say we have an identity
matrix on the right.

325
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,050
Let's call that I,
right there.

326
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,930
Now, our first linear
transformation we did-- we saw

327
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,240
that right here-- that
was equivalent to

328
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,910
multiplying S1 times A.

329
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,330
The first set of row operations
was this.

330
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,510
It got us here.

331
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,520
Now, if we perform that same set
of row operations on the

332
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,630
identity matrix, what
are we going to get?

333
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,050
We're going to get
the matrix S1.

334
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,580
S1 times the identity
matrix is just S1.

335
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,490
All of the columns of anything
times the identity times the

336
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,760
standard basis columns, it'll
just be equal to itself.

337
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,930
You'll just be left
with that S1.

338
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,820
This is S1 times I.

339
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,290
That's just S1.

340
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,090
Fair enough.

341
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,310
Now, you performed your next row
operation and you ended up

342
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,320
with S2 times S1, times A.

343
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,710
Now if you performed that same
row operation on this guy

344
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,820
right there, what
would you have?

345
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,430
You would have S2 times S1,
times the identity matrix.

346
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,300
Now, our last row operation we
represented with the matrix

347
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,800
product S3.

348
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,690
We're multiplying it by the
transformation matrix S3.

349
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,990
So if you did that, you
have S3, S2, S1 A.

350
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,550
But if you perform the same
exact row operations on this

351
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,940
guy right here, you have
S3, S2, S1, times

352
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,360
the identity matrix.

353
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,510
Now when you did this, when
you performed these row

354
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,690
operations here, this got you
to the identity matrix.

355
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,310
Well, what are these going
to get you to?

356
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,800
When you just performed the same
exact row operations you

357
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,270
performed on A to get to the
identity matrix, if you

358
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,110
performed those same exact row
operations on the identity

359
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,630
matrix, what do you get?

360
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,990
You get this guy right here.

361
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,790
Anything times that identity
matrix is going

362
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,930
to be equal to itself.

363
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,350
So what is that right there?

364
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,600
That is A inverse.

365
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,370
   

366
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,850
So we have a generalized way
of figuring out the inverse

367
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,630
for transformation matrix.

368
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,819
What I can do is, let's
say I have some

369
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,160
transformation matrix A.

370
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,420
I can set up an augmented
matrix where I put the

371
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,750
identity matrix right there,
just like that, and I perform

372
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,000
a bunch of row operations.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,670
   

374
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,060
And you could represent them
as matrix products.

375
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,069
But you perform a bunch of row
operations on all of them.

376
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,180
You perform the same operations
you perform on A as

377
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,119
you would do on the
identity matrix.

378
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,340
By the time you have A as an
identity matrix, you have A in

379
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,250
reduced row echelon form.

380
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,950
By the time A is like that, your
identity matrix, having

381
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,290
performed the same exact
operations on it, it is going

382
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,300
to be transformed into
A's inverse.

383
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,340
This is a very useful tool for
solving actual inverses.

384
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,150
Now, I've explained
the theoretical

385
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,180
reason why this works.

386
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,740
In the next video we'll
actually solve this.

387
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,610
Maybe we'll do it for the
example that I started off

388
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,740
with in this video.
