1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Let's think a little bit about what happened in the last video.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,500
I'll review again these different notions of money supply.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,300
And then let's talk about whether it's fair for people

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,400
to think that they really have the money that they have

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,200
So in the original video, after the crop was harvested,

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,400
the farmers deposited 1,000 gold pieces in my bank.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Then I lent out 900 of those.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,300
I had to keep some reserve

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
in case those farmers wanted some of their money back.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,500
And I figured they would never need more than 10% at a time.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,277
I lend it out.

12
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:30,654
They build a irrigate.

13
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:34,267
You know, someone has a great idea to build an irrigation canal,

14
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,667
so that more fields become usable and get access to water.

15
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,667
So to build that irritation canal,

16
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:40,667
they take those 900 gold pieces,

17
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,167
and they pay a bunch of workers.

18
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,167
Those workers now have the gold pieces.

19
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,036
So they need some place safe to put it.

20
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:47,280
They put it back in my bank.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,295
Now I get 900 gold pieces of deposits.

22
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:52,095
I put 10% aside again.

23
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,195
And now I lend out 810 gold pieces.

24
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:57,395
Let's say I lend it out for an entrepreneur

25
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:01,295
who wants to build a factory to build some type of tools

26
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,795
that might make the apple harvest more efficient,

27
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:08,080
or faster, or need less labor, or whatever.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,333
That entrepreneur takes those 810 gold pieces

29
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,449
and pays the builder in the town.

30
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,000
And then the builder now has 810 gold pieces,

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,231
and then he gives the money back to me in my bank.

32
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,500
Because I'm the safest place to keep it.

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,515
I stop the chain there.

34
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,992
You can keep going on and on,

35
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:25,508
although there is some end.

36
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:27,700
Notice that these values get smaller and smaller every time.

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,400
And we'll do a little bit of math on that to figure out how far it can go.

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,800
But then I take the builder's money,

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,400
and I said, well, you know, this banking idea's a new idea to me.

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm just going to leave it all as reserves.

41
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,600
I want to see how it all plays out first.

42
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,500
So then we said, how much money is in the system?

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,400
And it all depends on how you define money.

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
And we made one definition of money called M0.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,300
In M0 we said -- we'll call this our narrowest definition.

46
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,100
And this is literally, how much gold is there in the system.

47
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,500
Or how much stuff is there in the system

48
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,800
that could be immediately used for conducting a transaction.

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,500
And I'm assuming, for the sake of this argument,

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
that none of these players actually kept any gold in their pockets,

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,400
or kept some cash in their wallets for a rainy day.

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Although if they did, we would included it in this calculation.

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,400
I assume that everyone always deposits their gold with Bank of Sal.

54
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,900
So when we did that calculation.

55
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,400
-- there was this gold pieces of reserve that we had set aside at first.

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Then 90 here, oh, 900 here, sorry.

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,154
And then 810 here.

58
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:36,100
And if you add those up, you get 1,000 gold pieces in the system,

59
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,800
which makes a lot of sense.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,954
Because we originally had about 1,000 gold pieces in the system.

61
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,723
In the example, at least as I described it -

62
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,754
we didn't have anyone discovering any new gold.

63
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:52,000
nor was any a gold eaten or destroyed in some way.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
So it makes sense that there are 1,000 gold pieces.

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,500
But then there's a more interesting question.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,400
If you went around the city,

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
and you asked everyone how much money they had,

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,200
they'll say, I have this much in my checking account with the Bank of Sal.

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,400
If you ask me how much money I had,

70
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
I would tell you how much is in my checking account.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,300
I actually have very little cash in my wallet right now,

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,900
if any of you are thinking of mugging me.

73
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,100
All of my money is in a checking account.

74
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,000
So if someone asked me how much money do you have,

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'd give that number.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,400
So if you went around the town,

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,700
and you asked everyone, how much money do you have,

78
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,100
and you added it up,

79
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,000
you would get the total of the of their checking accounts.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,400
And so we had 810 gold pieces from the contractors,

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,500
900 gold pieces from the ditch diggers,

82
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,900
and then 1,000 gold pieces from the farmers.

83
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's see, 1,900 plus 810.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,800
You get 2,710 gold pieces collectively in checking accounts.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,400
And since I'm the only bank,

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
that's the total of my liabilities here.

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,923
And we call that M1.

88
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,100
And I'm calling these that for a reason

89
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,554
because these are the actual words that are used

90
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,977
by economists and our government officials.

91
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,700
There's a couple of really interesting questions here.

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,200
One is how did a 1,000 gold pieces get turned into 2,710.

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,969
And then, this 2,710, does it represent real wealth,

94
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,231
or was this some kind of weird shell game we played,

95
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,969
and it represents some type of weird pyramid scheme?

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,900
Well, how it got created -- we went through the mechanics, right?

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,400
Every time I set a little aside, I lent some out,

98
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
and then they deposited, etc. That's how it got created.

99
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,500
The interesting question is, does it represent real wealth?

100
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
The answer is it represents real wealth

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
if each of these investments were real investments.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,154
So if this 900 gold pieces that were used

103
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:49,300
to build this irrigation ditch or whatever it is,

104
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,108
if that project actually does generate

105
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:56,200
at least 900 gold pieces of future wealth

106
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,646
-- essentially you could at least pay back the 900 gold pieces.

107
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:02,400
It'll probably generate more if it's a good project.

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,100
But if it generates at least 900 gold pieces of future wealth,

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,500
then this is a real asset, right?

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,200
This is a real asset.

111
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,323
Likewise, if this factory really does generate

112
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:16,535
at least 810 gold pieces of future wealth,

113
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:21,500
if it really will allow us produce that much more apples or gold or whatever,

114
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,092
this is a real asset here, right?

115
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:29,438
So these people, this wealth, really does exist.

116
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:36,000
This 2,710 gold pieces of quota quote wealth, really does exist

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,900
as long as the projects that were the justification

118
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,000
for borrowing the money actually do generate future wealth.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
So there's a couple of things to realize.

120
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,677
There are not 2,710 gold pieces in this world.

121
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:55,400
There only 1,000 physical gold pieces.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,700
But if these projects are real projects that are actually not mismanaged,

123
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,200
they're not just some type of pouring-money-into-a-hole type of project,

124
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,931
then we do have 2,710 gold pieces worth of wealth.

125
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,415
And I really want to stress this point.

126
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,200
Remember gold isn't wealth in of itself.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,354
Gold is used to represent wealth.

128
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,677
You cannot eat gold.

129
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:21,369
You cannot live under gold.

130
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:24,000
Gold will not transport you someplace.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Gold will not improve your health.

132
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,000
It's something that's used to represent wealth.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
Sometimes people think it is wealth itself,

134
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,800
and that's actually a misconception.

135
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,900
So this 2,710 perceived gold pieces,

136
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,400
that does represent real wealth,

137
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,600
although it doesn't represent real gold pieces.

138
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,400
And once again you might say, oh boy,

139
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,800
this is some type of a shell game.

140
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
But it's really not.

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,700
As long as these investments are good investments.

142
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,400
Remember, these are wealth generating investments.

143
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,700
And notice, the money supply-- at least as we defined it with this M1

144
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,800
-- it expanded to facilitate real economic production.

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,000
So as long as this factory does generate wealth,

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
or this irrigation ditch does generate wealth,

147
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,338
then the money supply did not grow faster

148
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:18,285
than the amount of wealth out there.

149
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,000
So gold piece, you know, if before a gold piece bought an apple,

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,600
now hopefully a gold piece will still buy an apple.

151
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,700
In fact, and this is an important thing to realize,

152
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
if these investments are very good,

153
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
you're actually going to have

154
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:41,300
-- let's say that we used to produce 1,000 apples per year.

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,100
And notice apples are real wealth.

156
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,400
Apples are something that you can consume.

157
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,900
They will keep you living.

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,800
And you can also view them as a form of investment,

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
because by eating them you're able to do work.

160
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,600
But anyway, let's say before all of this investment started happening,

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,300
our economy could produce 1,000 apples.

162
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,800
Now let's say that after this irrigation ditch was produced,

163
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,500
instead of 1,000 apples, we go from being able to produce 1,000 apples

164
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,100
to being able to produce 2,000 apples a year.

165
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
And once again, a lot of wealth was created.

166
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Remember, we only took 900 gold pieces to build this.

167
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,100
And all of a sudden we're doubling.

168
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,400
We're able to produce another incremental 1,000 apples a year,

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,600
which, in our old economy, was worth 1,000 gold pieces.

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,500
So that actually will definitely pay off, right?

171
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,100
You borrowed 900 gold pieces

172
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,600
and this project will generate, not 1,000 gold pieces in total,

173
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,100
it'll actually generate the equivalent of 1,000 gold pieces per year.

174
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,700
It increases our production of 1,000 apples per year.

175
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,962
And likewise, let's say that

176
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:52,350
this factory takes us from 2,000 apples a year to 3,000.

177
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:53,923
So let's think about it.

178
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:57,400
Now in a given year, how many apples are being produced?

179
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
We used to only have 1,000 apples being produced.

180
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,400
Now we have 3,000 apples being produced,

181
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,815
because these were really good investments.

182
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,762
They really improved our productivity.

183
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,600
So now, if you say everyone in the economy thinks that

184
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,100
they have 2,710 gold pieces, or some equivalent of them,

185
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,900
and we can produce 3,000 apples,

186
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,800
now the money supply, 2,710, actually grew slower than our wealth.

187
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,500
Let me let me draw that out.

188
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Before... Let's say money.

189
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Wealth.

190
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,723
I think it's really important to separate the two concepts.

191
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:39,762
Money is used to transact wealth or represent wealth.

192
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,400
It is not wealth in and of itself.

193
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,400
And that has some important philosophical underpinnings to it.

194
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,700
It'll probably make you live happier if you realize this difference.

195
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,600
But before we had 1,000 gold pieces,

196
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
before the banking and this fractional reserve system existed.

197
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
And we had 1,000 apples of wealth per year.

198
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
And I'll go more into the velocity of money.

199
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
But after all this stuff happened later,

200
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,600
we had 2,710 perceived gold pieces.

201
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,069
This was our M1 definition.

202
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,500
Our M0, the actual physical gold, was still 1,000.

203
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,400
But how many apple do we produce a year?

204
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,500
We now produce 3,000 apples.

205
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,669
So notice the ratio of gold to apples actually improved

206
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,100
And now, if you think about it,

207
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,500
an apple is actually going to cost less gold.

208
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,600
Before roughly you had one gold piece per apple;

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,900
now you have less than one gold piece per apple.

210
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
So because of our innovation, we actually experienced deflation.

211
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
So you might have said, oh, boy,

212
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,377
all of this money was created out of nowhere.

213
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:42,800
This money doesn't exist.

214
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,900
This will lead to inflation.

215
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,100
But no, this is a very important point,

216
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,692
because the money was put to work

217
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:53,369
in actual productive investments that create wealth,

218
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:57,800
that make the pie bigger, or the pie of apples bigger,

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
we actually experience deflation.

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,300
And our economy actually grew.

221
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,500
And this was actually a very very positive example.

222
00:11:04,500 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll see you in the next video.
