1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,614
You may have of Turducken, a turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:08,124
Yeah, it's a cute idea, but mathematically uninspiring.

3
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:15,063
Much more interesting would some sort of fractal fowl arrangement. Say the turkey were stuffed with two ducks

4
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:22,410
And say each duck was stuffed with two hens. We'd get a Turduckduckenenenen, or Turduckenenduckenen

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,628
I'm not sure yet. Then each hen could be stuffed with two quails or whatever and by the time you get down to sparrows you

6
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:32,031
Have a whole flock of 'em in there. That sounds fun and practical, lets do it!

7
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:39,558
But being an extremely practical person who realizes that exponential quails will not fit in one turkey, I am using tiny unborn quails.

8
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:48,124
Eight of them inside four hens inside two ducks inside one turkey. This structure is much more interesting because birds belong in trees

9
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:53,781
Binary trees, that is. Obviously this is superior to old linear bird-stuffing paradime.

10
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:58,543
And while you're de-boning seven birds you'll have lots of time to consider the question of binary bird

11
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:05,075
Stuffing novenclature. How do you traverse this tree of syllabels? Unless you can say lots of words at once like

12
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:08,360
Turduckenail, you'll have to say the syllabells in a linear order.

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,626
You could go layer by layer, biggest birds first, like Turduckduckenenenenailailailailailailailail or you could

14
00:01:15,626 --> 00:01:21,328
down through the layers like Turduckenailailenailailduckenailailenailail

15
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:27,201
The second one is certainly more complicated to say, but I like they way the structure of it suggests the structure of the hole.

16
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:33,992
And say we made two of these and put them in a goose and in the first scheme the new bird names get inserted into the name to get

17
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:41,880
Gooturturduckduckenenenenenenenenailailailailailailailailailailailailailailailail

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,404
Well, for the second, you start with goose and just repeat the old word to get

19
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:54,113
Gooturduckenailailenailailduckenailailenailailturduckenailailenailailduckenailailenailail

20
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:59,572
So it's nice that part of it stays the same. Of course those aren't the only possible naming schemes. Maybe you go left to right

21
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:08,291
On the tree. So this would be ailenailduckailenail. Ooh! Abacabba pattern! Ok, so in 1807

22
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:13,907
A guy roasted a Bustard(whatever that is)stuffed with a turkey stuffed with a goose, stuffed with a pheasant, chicken, duck,

23
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:19,428
Guinea fowl, teal, woodcock, partridge, plover, lapwing, quail, thresh, lark, bunting, and warbler to get a

24
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:25,626
Busturgoosentenduckenytealcockridgeerwingailusharktingbler

25
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:29,675
But say he had done this with the new exponential bird stuffing paradime.

26
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:37,029
I mean, you'd need over 100,000 birds to do it, but the world has a lot of birds in it, and if you can consistently say four syllables a second,

27
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:43,377
You could say the in only,like,nine hours. It might seem like a lot, but its really not, compared to if you

28
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:48,324
Used, say, just twice as many kinds of birds. Then you would need over 8.5 billion individual birds

29
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:53,039
And if you started naming it as soon as you learned to talk, and take breaks to sleep at night, you'd still probably die

30
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,528
Before you finished, so I can't say I recommend it, by hey! Maybe with advances in medicine it will become a more feasible goal.

31
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:06,794
Anyway, there it is; two quail eggs in each hen, two hens in each duck, two ducks in this turkey, if I can close it.

32
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:10,955
Eventually I had to go for sewing up the turkey most of the way with one duckenailailenailail, and then stuffing the other duckenailailenailail

33
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:19,713
In. Now you can arrange it nicely with the original legs and wings and stuffing to make it look perfectly natural. There!

34
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:23,724
Anyway, once you've got that, you're pretty much good to go as far as Thanksgiving is concerned.

35
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:30,990
You should already have your gelatinous cranberry cylinder, red spheres with butter prism, mathed potatoes with organic hyperbolic plane,

36
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:40,772
Green bean vector field with borromean onion rings on top, double-helix cut ham, Pi, Tau and so on, and now finally you've got your Turduckenailailenailailduckenailailenailail

37
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:44,683
Or ailenailduckailenailkeyailenailduckailenail

38
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:51,234
or Turduckduckenenenenailailailailailailailail...whatever. Each slice gives a different cross section of this binary

39
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:58,769
Bird. Here you can see a quail egg wrapped in the light meat of the hen wrapped in the darker meat of the duck wrapped in the light meat of the turkey.

40
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,385
Another cross-section shows two eggs, now you can sit dow, eat your mathematically inspired food and be thankful that

41
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:08,385
No matter how crazy people are, at least mathematics is always there for you, making sense, and truth, and beauty, and birds, lots of birds.
