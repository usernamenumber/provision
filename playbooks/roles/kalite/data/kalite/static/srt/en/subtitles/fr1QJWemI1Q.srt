99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For a long time the middle ages had a bad reputation

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the general public regarded it as a gloomy dark interval

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Just after the second world war however

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the bleak middle ages suddenly changed color

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In January 1948 the popular life magazine printed a nearly 600 year old calendar

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in full color, for millions of readers

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the colorful reproductions suddenly got a prominent place in many a living room

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the images are now the icons of an era

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we find them on postcards

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in history books, on mouse pads, playing card and coasters

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but however famous this artwork has become though many reproductions

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its medieval creators remaine very obsuce

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The hidden masters of the middle ages

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the brothers Van Limburg

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the work of the Limburg brothers wasn't meant for us

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was created for the private enjoyment of kings and princes

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it stayed firmly behind the walls of castles and palaces for generations

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
no one elce ever lay eyes on it

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or even knew about its existence

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Limburgs brothers masterpiece is called The Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it is the most valueable book in the world.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This manuscript is safely looked away in Chateau de ?? just north of Paris.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The parchment pages are extremely vulnerable and hardly ever shown to the public.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Very rarely will one of the earths rulers be allowed a gimps of this manuscript.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Only presidents like J.F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon have preceded you.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The work created by the Limburg brothers consists of a large number of miniatures

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of unparalleled quality and detail.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These paintings however are smaller then an A4 page,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and are hidden away in a small number of books.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
By combining archive material with new discoveries in old libraries and museums,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a clearer pictures of the lives of these obscure master painters emerges from the mist of time.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the story of Herman,Paul and Johan van Limburg.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Also known as the Limburg brothers.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The limburg brothers rose rapidly at the French court,

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but very few people know that these medieval painters had their artistic base

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in what is now called the Netherlands.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They have something magical, fairy tail like

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yes, they emit something, and what they emit, for me is the authentic great artisty.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The smallness of it obviously is part of the excitement.

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's always has been one of the excitements,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
very large things and very small things.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The small things are secret.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The three Limburg brothers painted landscapes and portraits with a precision that was unheard of at that time.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They gave us the first snowy landscape in the history of painting.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Smoke from a chimney.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Skies full of clouds,

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A proper night scene.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Paintings with perspective

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
People of flesh and blood.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Limburg brothers were way ahead of their time with these innovations.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There medieval art set the trend for modern painting.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some painters make their career primarily because they can do one thing,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That was new or different and great and you focus on that primarily.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the Limburg brothers did all of it.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Indeed their art is the great flowering the great ???

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Like fireworks in the sky.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Huge shattering of some of the most beautiful art that was produced.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Some of these 600 year old painting are so realistic,

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we can still recognize them today.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The month December on the calendar

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Shows the great don of Vincennes castle clearly in the background.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Mont Saint-Michel hasn't changed much since the Limburg brothers lived.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Even back then the Burton monastery island fell dry at low tide.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Even though the farmers have left the city the Parisian Îll de La cité

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is clearly recognisible on the June page.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is these pictures of proud castle that determine our impression of the middle ages.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The illuminations of the Limburg brothers certainly give us a window into the medieval world,

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But its a window into a very rarerivied part of the medieval world.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's the world of a royal prince.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have to think of the times. These were extremely bad times.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Uhm. The king was mad.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the period of the 100 years war.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This wasn't an easy time to be alive.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Politically extremely unsettled.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When you look at the manuscripts however you don't have a sense of these peasants

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that they are, let's say overtaxed. But yet they look extremly happy to be working out in the fields.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Mowing the hay and reaping the weath.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Of course it's very dirty work. But you wouldn't know it from the pictures.

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It all looks as if every thing is sweet and humpty doory as we say.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The water of the river slowly passed under the arches of the bridge.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It was murky full of silt and dirt.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Only on the grassland and the fields outside the wall of Paris the work continued, regardless of the unrelenting heat,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it continue'd without pause.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The farmers wanted to bring the grain in before the destructive thunderstorms would roll in.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Out of the window's of Saint Paul and surrounding castles one could see the sowers run around the fields line little dots.

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The sun cough the sickles and scythes.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Half naked, dripping with sweat, the men cleared the fields.
