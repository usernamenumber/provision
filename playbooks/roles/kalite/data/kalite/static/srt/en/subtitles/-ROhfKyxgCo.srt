1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
By this point in the biology
playlist, you're probably

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,590
wondering a very natural
question, how is gender

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,380
determined in an organism?

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,840
And it's not an obvious answer,
because throughout the

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,210
animal kingdom, it's actually
determined in different ways.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,280
In some creatures, especially
some types of reptiles, it's

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,920
environmental.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,300
Not all reptiles, but
certain cases of it.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,750
It could be maybe the
temperature in which the

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,320
embryo develops will dictate
whether it turns into a male

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
or female or other environmental
factors.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,140
And in other types of animals,
especially mammals, of which

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,950
we are one example, it's
a genetic basis.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,180
And so your next question is,
hey, Sal, so-- let me write

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:57,880
this down, in mammals it's
genetic-- so, OK, maybe

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,300
they're different alleles, a
male or a female allele.

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,470
But then you're like, hey, but
there's so many different

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,460
characteristics that
differentiate

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,050
a man from a woman.

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,210
Maybe it would have to be a
whole set of genes that have

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,320
to work together.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,050
And to some degree,
your second answer

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,300
would be more correct.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,720
   

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,690
It's even more than just
a set of genes.

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,410
It's actually whole chromosomes
determine it.

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,360
So let me draw a nucleus.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,540
That's going to be my nucleus.

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,590
And this is going to be
the nucleus for a man.

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,750
So 22 of the pairs of
chromosomes are just regular

32
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,670
non-sex-determining
chromosomes.

33
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,050
So I could just do, that's one
of the homologous, 2, 4, 6, 8,

34
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,380
10, 12, 14.

35
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,340
I can just keep going.

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,590
And eventually you
have 22 pairs.

37
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,230
So these 22 pairs right there,
they're called autosomal.

38
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,080
And those are just our standard
pairs of chromosomes

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,340
that code for different
things.

40
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:02,850
Each of these right here is a
homologous pair, homologous,

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,830
which we learned before
you get one from

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,560
each of your parents.

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,410
They don't necessarily code for
the same thing, for the

44
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,210
same versions of the genes,
but they code

45
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,210
for the same genes.

46
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,450
If eye color is on this gene,
it's also on that gene, on the

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,640
other gene of the
homologous pair.

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,100
Although you might have
different versions of eye

49
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,670
color on either one and that
determines what you display.

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,170
But these are just kind of the
standard genes that have

51
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,460
nothing to do with our gender.

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,030
And then you have these two
other special chromosomes.

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,670
   

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,460
I'll do this one.

55
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,600
It'll be a long brown one, and
then I'll do a short blue one.

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
And the first thing you'll
notice is that they don't look

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,990
homologous.

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,025
How could they code for the same
thing when the blue one

59
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,180
is short and the brown
one's long?

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,860
And that's true.

61
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,480
They aren't homologous.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,225
And these we'll call our
sex-determining chromosomes.

63
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:59,900
   

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,680
And the long one right here,
it's been the convention to

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,050
call that the x chromosome.

66
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,650
   

67
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,240
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

68
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,630
And the blue one right there,
we refer to that as the y

69
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,350
chromosome.

70
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,730
And to figure out whether
something is a male or a

71
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,840
female, it's a pretty
simple system.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,900
If you've got a y chromosome,
you are a male.

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,840
So let me write that down.

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,820
So this nucleus that I drew
just here-- obviously you

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,180
could have the whole broader
cell all around here-- this is

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,030
the nucleus for a man.

77
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,960
So if you have an x chromosome--
and we'll talk

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,660
about in a second why you can
only get that from your mom--

79
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,990
an x chromosome from your mom
and a y chromosome from your

80
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,290
dad, you will be a male.

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,110
If you get an x chromosome
from your mom and an x

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,590
chromosome from your dad, you're
going to be a female.

83
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,100
And so we could actually even
draw a Punnett square.

84
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,720
This is almost a trivially easy
Punnett square, but it

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,310
kind of shows what all of the
different possibilities are.

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,860
So let's say this is your
mom's genotype for her

87
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,340
sex-determining chromosome.

88
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
She's got two x's.

89
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,920
That's what makes her your
mom and not your dad.

90
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,980
And then your dad has an x and
a y-- I should do it in

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,990
capital-- and has
a Y chromosome.

92
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,850
And we can do a Punnett
square.

93
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,300
What are all the different
combinations of offspring?

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,450
Well, your mom could give this
X chromosome, in conjunction

95
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,420
with this X chromosome
from your dad.

96
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,580
This would produce a female.

97
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,620
Your mom could give this other
X chromosome with that X

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,780
chromosome.

99
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,540
That would be a female
as well.

100
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,490
Well, your mom's always going
to be donating an X

101
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,340
chromosome.

102
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,180
And then your dad is going to
donate either the X or the Y.

103
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,510
So in this case, it'll
be the Y chromosome.

104
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,900
So these would be female,
and those would be male.

105
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,140
And it works out nicely
that half are female

106
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,590
and half are male.

107
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:56,450
But a very interesting and
somewhat ironic fact might pop

108
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,850
out at you when you see this.

109
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,270
Who determines whether their
offspring are male or female?

110
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,380
Is it the mom or the dad?

111
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,840
Well, the mom always donates an
X chromosome, so in no way

112
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,060
does what the haploid genetic
makeup of the mom's eggs, of

113
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,520
the gamete from the female, in
no way does that determine the

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,030
gender of the offspring.

115
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,970
It's all determined by whether--
let me just draw a

116
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,950
bunch of-- dad's got a lot of
sperm, and they're all racing

117
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,000
towards the egg.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,390
And some of them have an X
chromosome in them and some of

119
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,010
them have a Y chromosome
in them.

120
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,610
And obviously they
have others.

121
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,530
And obviously if this guy
up here wins the race.

122
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,340
Or maybe I should
say this girl.

123
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,640
If she wins the race, then the
fertilized egg will develop

124
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,800
into a female.

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,200
If this sperm wins the race,
then the fertilized egg will

126
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,020
develop into a male.

127
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,880
And the reason why I said it's
ironic is throughout history,

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,650
and probably the most famous
example of this

129
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,350
is Henry the VIII.

130
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,900
   

131
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,490
I mean it's not just the
case with kings.

132
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,950
It's probably true, because most
of our civilization is

133
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,080
male dominated, that you've had
these men who are obsessed

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
with producing a male
heir to kind of take

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
over the family name.

136
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,740
And, in the case of Henry the
VIII, take over a country.

137
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,220
And they become very
disappointed and they tend to

138
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,360
blame their wives when the wives
keep producing females,

139
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,140
but it's all their fault.

140
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,230
Henry the VIII, I mean
the most famous case

141
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,480
was with Ann Boleyn.

142
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,160
   

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,630
I'm not an expert here, but the
general notion is that he

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,240
became upset with her that she
wasn't producing a male heir.

145
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,060
And then he found a reason
to get her essentially

146
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,135
decapitated, even though
it was all his fault.

147
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,710
   

148
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,320
He was maybe producing a lot
more sperm that looked like

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,030
that than was looking
like this.

150
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,670
He eventually does produce a
male heir so he was-- and if

151
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,640
we assume that it was his
child-- then obviously he was

152
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
producing some of these, but for
the most part, it was all

153
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,320
Henry the VIII's fault.

154
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,350
So that's why I say there's a
little bit of irony here.

155
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,790
Is that the people doing the
blame are the people to blame

156
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,890
for the lack of a male heir.

157
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,770
Now one question that might
immediately pop up in your

158
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,280
head is, Sal, is everything on
these chromosomes related to

159
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,970
just our sex-determining traits
or are there other

160
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,510
stuff on them?

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,400
So let me draw some
chromosomes.

162
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,930
So let's say that's an X
chromosome and this is a Y

163
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,720
chromosome.

164
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,010
Now the X chromosome, it does
code for a lot more things,

165
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,760
although it is kind of
famously gene poor.

166
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,720
It codes for on the order
of 1,500 genes.

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,640
And the Y chromosome, it's the
most gene poor of all the

168
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,690
chromosomes.

169
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,400
It only codes for on the
order of 78 genes.

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,160
I just looked this up, but who
knows if it's exactly 78.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,030
But what it tells you is it does
very little other than

172
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,700
determining what
the gender is.

173
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,650
And the way it determines that,
it does have one gene on

174
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,960
it called the SRY gene.

175
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,930
You don't have to know that.

176
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:32,950
SRY, that plays a role in the
development of testes or the

177
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,750
male sexual organ.

178
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,320
So if you have this around, this
gene right here can start

179
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,669
coding for things that will
eventually lead to the

180
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,179
development of the testicles.

181
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,110
And if you don't have that
around, that won't happen, so

182
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,760
you'll end up with a female.

183
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,500
And I'm making gross
oversimplifications here.

184
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,710
But everything I've dealt with
so far, OK, this clearly plays

185
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,890
a role in determining sex.

186
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,390
But you do have other traits
on these genes.

187
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,920
And the famous cases all deal
with specific disorders.

188
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,560
So, for example, color
blindness.

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,530
The genes, or the mutations
I should say.

190
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,550
So the mutations that cause
color blindness.

191
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:21,000
Red-green color blindness, which
I did in green, which is

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,250
maybe a little bit
inappropriate.

193
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,240
Color blindness and
also hemophilia.

194
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,960
This is an inability of
your blood to clot.

195
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,840
Actually, there's several
types of hemophilia.

196
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,060
But hemophilia is an
inability for your

197
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,830
blood to clot properly.

198
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,935
And both of these are mutations
on the X chromosome.

199
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:45,590
   

200
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,115
And they're recessive
mutations.

201
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:49,910
   

202
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,150
So what does that mean?

203
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,360
It means both of your X
chromosomes have to have--

204
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,120
let's take the case for
hemophilia-- both of your X

205
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,460
chromosomes have to have the
hemophilia mutation in order

206
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,180
for you to show the phenotype
of having hemophilia.

207
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,080
So, for example, if there's a
woman, and let's say this is

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
her genotype.

209
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,610
She has one regular X chromosome
and then she has

210
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,200
one X chromosome that has
the-- I'll put a little

211
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,580
superscript there for
hemophilia-- she has the

212
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,510
hemophilia mutation.

213
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,870
She's just going to
be a carrier.

214
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,480
Her phenotype right here is
going to be no hemophilia.

215
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,950
   

216
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,460
She'll have no problem
clotting her blood.

217
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,040
The only way that a woman could
be a hemophiliac is if

218
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,910
she gets two versions of
this, because this

219
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,160
is a recessive mutation.

220
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,230
   

221
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,510
Now this individual will
have hemophilia.

222
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,660
Now men, they only have
one X chromosome.

223
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,990
So for a man to exhibit
hemophilia, to have this

224
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,630
phenotype, he just needs
it only on the one X

225
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,530
chromosome he has.

226
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,040
And then the other one's
a Y chromosome.

227
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,980
   

228
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,150
So this man will have
hemophilia.

229
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,510
So a natural question should be
arising is, hey, you know

230
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,120
this guy-- let's just say that
this is a relatively

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,210
infrequent mutation that arises
on an X chromosome--

232
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,960
the question is who's more
likely to have hemophilia?

233
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,020
A male or a female?

234
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,620
All else equal, who's more
likely to have it?

235
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,490
Well if this is a relatively
infrequent allele, a female,

236
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,640
in order to display it, has
to get two versions of it.

237
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,400
So let's say that the frequency
of it-- and I looked

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,360
it up before this video--
roughly they say between 1 in

239
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,460
5,000 to 10,000 men exhibit
hemophilia.

240
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,020
So let's say that the allele
frequency of this is 1 in

241
00:11:51,020 --> 00:12:00,130
7,000, the frequency of Xh, the
hemophilia version of the

242
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,100
X chromosome.

243
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,490
And that's why 1 in 7,000 men
display it, because it's

244
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,190
completely determined whether--
there's a 1 in 7,000

245
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,810
chance that this X chromosome
they get is

246
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,250
the hemophilia version.

247
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,120
Who cares what the Y chromosome
they get is, cause

248
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,130
that essentially doesn't code at
all for the blood clotting

249
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,700
factors and all of the things
that drive hemophilia.

250
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,870
Now, for a woman to get

251
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,140
hemophilia, what has to happen?

252
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,120
She has to have two X
chromosomes with the mutation.

253
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,020
Well the probability of each of
them having the mutation is

254
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,630
1 in 7,000.

255
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,110
So the probability of her having
hemophilia is 1 in

256
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:46,150
7,000 times 1 in 7,000, or
that's 1 in what, 49 million.

257
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,790
So as you can imagine, the
incidence of hemophilia in

258
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,880
women is much lower than
the incidence of

259
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,220
hemophilia in men.

260
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,600
And in general for any
sex-linked trait, if it's

261
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,990
recessive, if it's a recessive
sex-linked trait, which means

262
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,530
men, if they have it, they're
going to show it, because they

263
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,740
don't have another X chromosome
to dominate it.

264
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,640
Or for women to show
it, she has to have

265
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,870
both versions of it.

266
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:18,150
The incidence in men is going to
be, so let's say that m is

267
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,060
the incidence in men.

268
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,725
   

269
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:24,975
I'm spelling badly.

270
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:29,560
   

271
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,330
Then the incidence in
women will be what?

272
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,040
You could view this as the
allele frequency of that

273
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,000
mutation on the X chromosome.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,110
So women have to get
two versions of it.

275
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,680
So the woman's frequency
is m squared.

276
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
And you might say, hey, that
looks like a bigger number.

277
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,280
I'm squaring it.

278
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,610
But you have to remember that
these numbers, the frequency

279
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,250
is less than 1, so in the
case of hemophilia,

280
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,200
that was 1 in 7,000.

281
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,680
So if you square 1 in 7,000,
you get 1 in 49 million.

282
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,240
Anyway, hopefully you found that
interesting and now you

283
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,210
know how we all become
men and women.

284
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,470
And even better you know whom to
blame when some of these, I

285
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,340
guess, male-focused parents
are having trouble

286
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,590
getting their son.

287
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,336
