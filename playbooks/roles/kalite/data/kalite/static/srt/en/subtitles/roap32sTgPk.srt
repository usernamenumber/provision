1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,410
So now let's think about, I
talked about what the Fed's

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,790
bailout proposal is.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,470
They essentially want to take
$700 billion and use that to

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,860
buy some of these smelly assets,
these CDOs that a lot

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,670
of these banks have on
the balance sheet.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,540
Which have been kind of the
cause of why a lot of these

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,270
banks are going under.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,920
Or at least why a lot
of the banks aren't

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,660
lending to each other.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,180
And I kind of touched on it in
the last video that, in my

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,240
mind, maybe its solves the
problem, but even if it does

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,670
solve a problem, we'll address
that in this video, but it

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,810
seems like a really horrible
thing to do.

15
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,420
Because if you were to buy
these assets, let's say

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,980
they're worth zero, you pay
$2 billion for them.

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,260
You're essentially writing a
check to the equity holders of

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,130
this company, the shareholders
of this company, they

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,600
benefited from all the reward
of the last five years of

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,890
getting the returns on that
stock price and the dividends

21
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,960
and whatever else.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,680
And now all of a sudden when
things go bad, they

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,580
don't bear the risk.

24
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,670
The American taxpayer
bears the risk.

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,700
And so you're writing a $1
billion check to the equity

26
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,360
holders and a $1 billion check
to the liability holders, or

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,410
the people who lent this
company money.

28
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,590
And you've probably heard
the word moral

29
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,310
hazard bantered around.

30
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,090
And this is as good of a time as
any to explain what people

31
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,970
mean by moral hazard.

32
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,570
Well there's a couple, there's
one, just a superficial notion

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,120
of, hey you are writing a check
to the very same people

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,500
who made bad decisions.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,700
The people who lent this
company money made bad

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,510
decisions and the equity holders
of this company made

37
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,120
bad decisions.

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,900
One, the people who invested in
this company, they didn't

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
realize the risk.

40
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,240
And also, a lot of the equity
holders are the management of

41
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,910
the company.

42
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,890
And they're the very ones who
invested in these CDOs.

43
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,830
And if you were to essentially
buy out these CDOs, you're not

44
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,030
penalizing them for making
bad decisions.

45
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,140
They get to keep all their
bonuses before.

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,070
Maybe they get to keep
their jobs still.

47
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,170
And you're propping up
their stock price.

48
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,180
So that's one element
of moral hazard.

49
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,120
The other element of moral
hazard, and this is a more

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,440
nuanced notion, but it's in some
ways the more important

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,860
element of moral hazard.

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,190
And that's if the government
goes in every time that

53
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,310
there's some type of
financial stress.

54
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,510
All these people took risk, they
got their reward already.

55
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,560
But when the risk starts to hit,
the government goes in

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,900
and make sure that these people
don't have to deal with

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,140
their consequences.

58
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,370
The moral hazard there is in the
future, people are going

59
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,230
to say I'm going to take risk.

60
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,320
Because if when times
are good, I'm

61
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,370
going to make the money.

62
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,500
And when times are bad, we've
seen it multiple times, the

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,790
government, the U.S. government,
is all too ready

64
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,760
to come out and bail out
the private sector.

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,650
So you create this moral hazard
of making these bubbles

66
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,400
more likely to happen
in the future.

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,980
Because people are not going to
be as concerned about risk,

68
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,860
because they're, like, look at
these idiots, they took all

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,060
the risks in the world, they
bought CDOs, there were people

70
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,990
who lent money to these people
who bought CDOs, they were

71
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,830
levered up.

72
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,470
And the government even bailed
out these dudes.

73
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,920
So I can take huge risk, I'll
get all the reward from it,

74
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,180
and in the future the government
is just going to

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,180
bail me out.

76
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,260
And that's the other element
of moral hazard.

77
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,070
Well anyway, I would argue that
there's a lot of moral

78
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,290
hazard with the government's
current bailout proposal.

79
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,460
Maybe that moral hazard is worth
it if it prevents this

80
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,740
chain, this cascade, of
events from happening.

81
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,730
If somehow it allows people to
start lending to each other

82
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,970
and most importantly, start
lending to the real world,

83
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,950
like the guy who wants to build
a factory or the farmer

84
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,860
who wants to borrow money for
seeds for next year's crop.

85
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,760
What I've heard, and I don't
know the exact numbers here,

86
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,750
and I'm not an expert here, is
that there's about $5 trillion

87
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,980
of these toxic CDOs.

88
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,600
On all of these financial
institutions' balance sheet.

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,070
So I don't know if that's
the accurate number.

90
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,760
But I do know for sure, $700
billion is a relatively small

91
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,460
fraction of the total amount
that's out there.

92
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,810
And Bernanke and Paulson,
they're essentially arguing,

93
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,440
no we know $700 billion doesn't
represent all the CDOs

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
out there, even if you were
to buy them at a discount.

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,680
But what we're hoping to do is
by going out there and with a

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,660
large amount of money and
starting to buy these CDOs,

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,240
that'll hopefully create
some type of a

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,480
market in these CDOs.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,760
And they talk about doing
a reverse auction.

100
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,340
Where we'll say, OK
we're ready to buy

101
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,670
$100 billion in CDOs.

102
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,050
So whatever banks are willing to
give us $100 billion worth

103
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,050
of CDOs at the best price, those
are the ones we're going

104
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,500
to buy from.

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,720
That's a reverse auction.

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,250
You go and you say, I want to
buy, who's going to sell to me

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,800
for the cheapest price?

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,210
And by doing that, maybe
it'll create

109
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,490
other private interests.

110
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,610
We'll say hey, the government's
getting a good

111
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,160
deal on these CDOs, I want to
buy in too and maybe other

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,940
people will start buying
these CDOs.

113
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,330
The reason why I call that
crap is because if other

114
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,150
people were there to buy CDOs,
they would buy them already.

115
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,050
And the bottom line is, when
you do this type of reverse

116
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,090
auction, when you say, oh I have
$100 billion I want to

117
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,430
spend on CDOs, Paulson and
Bernanke are arguing that that

118
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,260
would somehow create some type
of market price for these CDOs

119
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,970
that these banks can then mark
their assets and everyone will

120
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,380
know what they're worth.

121
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,740
Two problems. That will
not be a market price.

122
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,770
Because you're creating
artificial demand.

123
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,440
Artificial demand from
the government.

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,110
If the government wasn't there,
there wouldn't be this

125
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,120
$100 billion entity wanting
to buy assets.

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,990
So the assets would
go for less.

127
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,260
And then the second thing is,
what if the government does

128
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,630
that and people realize that
these $2 billion of CDOs, even

129
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,520
when the government does this
reverse auction, are actually

130
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,990
worth only $500 million.

131
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,440
That's what people are willing
to unload them for.

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,150
And it would probably the
more solvent people

133
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,490
who would do it.

134
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,760
Because for them it won't
make them go bankrupt.

135
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Well if they're really worth
$500 million, then every other

136
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,590
bank that holds the same thing
will have to write this $2

137
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,840
billion down to $500 million.

138
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,020
And so their equity will get
wiped out and the cascade will

139
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,320
start over again.

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,910
So I don't buy it
on two counts.

141
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,400
One, I don't think it'll
actually create a real market

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,780
price that anyone
would believe.

143
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,350
I don't think it's going to
make anyone jump into the

144
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,440
market all of a sudden.

145
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,325
Frankly, if someone thought
these were good deals, there

146
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,100
are a lot of very very
sophisticated investors out

147
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,510
there who have a lot more
knowledge about what these

148
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,690
assets really mean than frankly
the Treasury does.

149
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,260
And if they thought they were
good deals, I guarantee you

150
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,450
there's capital out there where
they would go and buy

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,310
these assets for what they
thought is a good deal.

152
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,840
And hold them to maturity.

153
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,220
There is cash out there.

154
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,590
And I think that's an important
issue that people

155
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,170
don't realize.

156
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,380
A lot of people are out there
holding cash, they're holding

157
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,320
treasuries.

158
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,720
They just don't want to invest
in these because

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,710
they are bad deals.

160
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,870
People are looking
for a good deal.

161
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,470
But these are most probably
not worth much.

162
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,700
They're probably
worth nothing.

163
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,590
So what is another solution?

164
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,040
And this is something that a
lot of people have bantered

165
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,620
around a lot.

166
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,500
They said, well why doesn't the
government just go in and

167
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,540
instead of just buying out
these CDOs, which is

168
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,690
essentially just writing a check
to the very people who

169
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,100
got us into the situation,
why not buy

170
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,270
stock in these companies?

171
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,020
So we talked about those
situations with the sovereign

172
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,860
wealth funds.

173
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,170
Where the sovereign wealth fund
comes in, in that example

174
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,150
they bought $3 billion worth
of equity, and they gave $3

175
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,290
billion worth of cash.

176
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,190
And then the company can use
those to pay off its debt.

177
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,310
That frankly, is not
a horrible idea.

178
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,240
The only reason why I would
say it's still not a great

179
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,990
idea is, you're diluting
the shareholders.

180
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,390
But what if this equity
is worth zero?

181
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,990
What if there's actually
negative equity here?

182
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,480
If this is worth zero, if these
$2 billion are actually

183
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,520
worth zero, then this is
an insolvent company.

184
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,810
You have $3 billion of assets,
$4 billion of liabilities,

185
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,080
this is actually minus
$1 billion of equity.

186
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,110
So really the stock
has no value.

187
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,570
The correct share price of the
stock, if we didn't have

188
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,390
limited liability with
corporations, the correct

189
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,180
market capitalization would
be minus $1 billion.

190
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,630
So why would you pay a positive

191
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,340
price for those shares?

192
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,890
So even in that situation, if
this is really worth zero, and

193
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,640
the government were to buy a lot
of shares and infuse this

194
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,240
with capital, it would
save the company.

195
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,290
It would penalize the
equity holders.

196
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,310
Because all of a sudden instead
of having 500 million

197
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,360
shares, you maybe have
2 billion shares.

198
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,420
If you owned 100% of the company
before, now you only

199
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,250
own 20% of the company.

200
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,955
And that's actually what
happened with AIG.

201
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,780
You might say well that's a
pretty good situation, but

202
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,950
still the government's taking
a little bit of a hit.

203
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,110
And and frankly, if the
government did that, I think

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,770
the risk-reward might
be reasonable there.

205
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,880
Because if the government were
to infuse capital into these

206
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,640
banks-- let me do the example.

207
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,090
Let's say there's 500
million shares now.

208
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,200
The government says,
we're going to give

209
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,630
this company $4 billion.

210
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,460
So we're going to give it
$4 billion in cash.

211
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,290
   

212
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:55,400
And let's say for those four
billion shares, we want--

213
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,010
let's make it really intense.

214
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,780
Let's say the government wants
ten billion shares.

215
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,370
So essentially they're paying
$0.40 per share.

216
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,240
So then we're going to have
10 billion shares here.

217
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,960
So that's 10,000 million.

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,690
And we're going to have
10.5 billion shares.

219
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,000
This is actually not a
bad situation for me.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,580
So the company now will have $4
billion of cash, $3 billion

221
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,710
of other assets.

222
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,430
And now these CDOs maybe
are worth nothing.

223
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,260
Now no matter what, this company
cannot go bankrupt.

224
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,590
It has $4 billion of cash, $4
billion of liability, it could

225
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,620
pay off its liability with
that equity infusion.

226
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,700
And the people who deserved to
kind of take some downside,

227
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,590
did get downside.

228
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,820
Because the equity holders, they
used to have 100% of the

229
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,990
company with their 500
million shares.

230
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,750
Now they own, what is this?

231
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,850
They own 1/21 of
their company.

232
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,380
So they got diluted from owning
100% of the company to

233
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,380
owning less than 5%
of the company.

234
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,710
So this might be a
fair situation.

235
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,840
Although, I would still say even
in this situation you are

236
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,000
bailing out the people who lent
this money to the bank.

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,800
They lent money to an
institution that they

238
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,440
should've known better than
to lend money to.

239
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,940
They're holding all these toxic
assets, they collected

240
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,240
interest on this institution.

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
Right when this institution was
about to go belly up, the

242
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,030
government does this huge
equity infusion and

243
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,260
essentially takes over
the company.

244
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,940
Makes it a part of
the government.

245
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,100
Because the government now owns
90-something percent of

246
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,280
the company.

247
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,160
And pays off the liability
holders.

248
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,890
So I would still say that
there's still some moral

249
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,440
hazard here.

250
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,890
Because in the future, you're
still hurting the equity

251
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,730
holders, but you'd still be
willing to lend to an American

252
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,670
bank, because you'd say, when
things get bad the American

253
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,810
government goes in and
bails out the bank by

254
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,930
buying a bunch of equity.

255
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,420
So you won't properly price
and risk in the future.

256
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,160
But if this does open up lending
markets and people

257
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,950
start lending to the farmer or
to the guy who wants to build

258
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,650
factories, then maybe
this is worth it.

259
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,350
And actually, in my mind, if the
government is really not

260
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,410
worried about the banks, and
they really are worried about

261
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,650
this piece, the farmer who needs
a loan, or the guy wants

262
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,450
to build a factory that
needs a loan.

263
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,550
Why don't they take that $700
billion and just create a fund

264
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,760
to lend directly to the real
world, to lend directly to

265
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,530
Main Street?

266
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,180
Why don't they just let all of
these banks go bankrupt, go

267
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,310
into bankruptcy?

268
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,910
They'll come back and they'll
come back leaner and more

269
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,410
efficient with proper risk
measures and everyone will get

270
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,370
punished appropriately.

271
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,600
So that in the next up cycle
there won't be all of this

272
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,710
moral hazard.

273
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,360
And you have the $700 billion
that is going directly to lend

274
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,890
to farmers and companies that
are building capital equipment

275
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,390
and whatever.

276
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,130
And of course, there still
is moral hazard.

277
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,440
And it's going to get
highly politicized.

278
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,960
Who do you lend to, et cetera?

279
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,040
Maybe then you still do
a reverse auction.

280
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,820
But the bottom line is, if the
government were genuine about

281
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,980
being concerned about Main
Street, they wouldn't use this

282
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,870
$700 billion in this
indirect way.

283
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,520
They would lend it directly
to Main Street.

284
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,430
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
