I have talked a lot about using polynomials to approximate

2
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:07,093
functions. but I want to do is show you the

3
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:09,329
approximation is actually happening.

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:11,745
So right over here and I'm using Wolfram Alpha

5
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,733
for this. It is a very cool website

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:15,200
You can do all kinds of crazy mathamatical things

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,302
on it. So wolframalpha.com

8
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,334
and I got this copy paste. I met Steven Wolfram

9
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,252
at a conference not too long ago.

10
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,931
He said, yes, definitely use wolfram alpha in your

11
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:27,800
videos and I said, Great ! I will, and so that is what I'm

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,333
using right here and its super useful because what it

13
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,000
does is - and we could have calculated all this on our own

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,933
#
or even done it on a graphing calculator or we can

15
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,444
do it with just one step on wolfram alpha -

16
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:41,133
is see how well we can approximate

17
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:47,400
sin of x using a Maclaurin series expansion

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,600
or we can call it a Taylor series expansion at x = 0

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,867
using more and more terms,

20
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,683
having a good feel for the fact that

21
00:00:54,683 --> 00:00:56,400
the more terms we add

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,867
the better it hugs the sine curve.

23
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:03,019
So this over here in orange is sin of x.

24
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,757
It should look fairly familiar to you

25
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:08,867
and in previous videos we figured out

26
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,533
what the Maclaurin expansion for sin of x is

27
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:15,533
and wolfram alpha does it for us as well.

28
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,867
They actually calculate the factorials for us.

29
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:22,181
3 factorial is 6, 5 factorial is 120, and so forth.

30
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,000
What's interesting here is, you can pick

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,750
how many approximations you want to graph.

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,533
So what they did is, if you want

33
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,933
just one term of the approximation,

34
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:36,369
if we just said that the whole polynomial is equal to x

35
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:38,360
what does that look like?

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,357
Well, that's going to be this graph right here.

37
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,733
They tell us how many terms we use

38
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:44,467
by how many dots there are,

39
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:46,867
which I think is pretty clever.

40
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:50,800
So this right here, that is a function p(x)

41
00:01:50,800 --> 99:59:59,999
p(x) = x
