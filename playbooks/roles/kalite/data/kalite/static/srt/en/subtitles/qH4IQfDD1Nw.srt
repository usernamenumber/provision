00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:07,867
Were asked to subtract all of the craziness over here. and it looks daunting but if we really focus,

2
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:13,867
it should actually be really easy to subtract and simplify this thing. Right from the get go i have four

3
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:20,733
time the fourth root of 81 x to the fifth and from that, i want to subtract two times the fourth root

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:27,333
of eighty one x to the fifth and so you can really just say that i have four of something, and this

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:31,000
something, i will just circle it yellow. i have four of these--it could be lemon-- i have four of these

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,667
things, and i want to subtract two of these things. These are the exact same things. there the fourth

7
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:41,000
root of eight one x to the fifth, and the fourth root of eight one x to the fifth. So, if i have four

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,733
lemons and i want to subract two of them, im gonna have two lemons left over. If i have four of this

9
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:52,600
thing and i have to take away two of this thing, im gonna have two of these thing left over. So these

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:01,067
terms right over here simplify to two times the fourth root of eight one x to the fifth, and i got this

11
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:06,267
two just by subtracting the quantity of four of some by two of something, and this is equal to two of

12
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:16,667
something. And of course, we still have this minus the regular principle square root of x to the third.

13
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:21,333
now i wanna try to simplify, i wanna try to simplify whats inside of these- under the radical signs-

14
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:28,133
so that we can on, on this example take the fourth root and over here, actually take maybe a principle

15
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:34,333
square root. So first of all lets see if eighty one is either a, is something to the fourth power, ot
