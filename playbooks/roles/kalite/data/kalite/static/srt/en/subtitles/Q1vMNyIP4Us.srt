00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,374
What I want to do in this video is write the algebraic expressions

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:07,842
that represent the same thing that these statements are saying.

3
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:13,710
So this first statement, they say "The sum of -7 and the quantity 8 times x,"

4
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:19,437
So the sum, the sum...so we're going to have an addition here...of -7...

5
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:20,970
of -7...

6
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,366
...and the quantity 8 times x...

7
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:28,660
...so the quantity 8 times x. Well that's just 8x...

8
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,803
(So I can just write 8x over there)

9
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:33,810
So it is -7+8x,

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,334
or you could view this as the sum of -7 and the quantity 8 times x.

11
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:41,172
Let's do the next one!

12
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:44,439
Take the quantity -3 times x,

13
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,770
so take the quantity -3 times x,

14
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:51,493
and then add 1...and then add 1...

15
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:57,075
So the quantity -3 times x, we can write that as -3x,

16
00:00:57,337 --> 00:00:59,382
and then we need to add 1 to that.

17
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:02,781
So that's going to be plus...plus 1.

18
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:07,606
Now this one: -6 plus...-6 plus...

19
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:10,864
so we can write -6 plus something

20
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:13,983
The product of -1 and x.

21
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:19,322
So the product of -1 and x...that's just going to be -1x.

22
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:22,587
-1x which is the same thing as -x.

23
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:27,884
So we can write this as -6 plus -x, or we can just write this...

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,119
this is the exact same thing as

25
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:34,658
-6-x.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,666
And we are done!
