1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:03,228
Where we left off in the last video, we had a mature,

2
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:07,133
massive star, a star that had started forming a

3
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:13,400
core of iron and it has enormous inward pressure on this core

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,229
because as we form heavier and heavier elements in the core,

5
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:23,933
the core gets denser and denser, and so we keep fusing more and more elements

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:30,067
into it, and so this core becomes more and more massive, more and more dense,

7
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:36,734
squeezing in on itself, and so. . . It's not fusing! That is not exothermic anymore!

8
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:39,867
If iron were to fuse, it would not even be an exothermic process!

9
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:43,133
It would require energy! So it wouldn't be even something that could help

10
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:49,467
to fend off this squeezing, this increasing density of the core,

11
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:52,377
so we have this iron here, and it just gets more and more massive,

12
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:58,431
more and more dense, and so at some mass, already a reasonably high mass,

13
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,759
the only thing that's keeping this from just completely collapsing

14
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,800
is what we call Electron Degeneracy Pressure.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,313
Let me write this here. . .

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,282
and all this means is we have all of these iron atoms

17
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:26,302
really close to each other, and the only thing

18
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:32,386
that keeps it from collapsing altogether at this earlier stage is that

19
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:36,600
you have these electrons and these are being squeezed together

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,400
we're talking about unbelievably dense states of matter.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,600
And electron degeneracy pressure is essentially saying that

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,320
all these electrons don't want to be into the same place

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,897
at the same time. I won't go into the quantum mechanics of it,

24
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:55,733
but they cannot be squeezed into each other any more!

25
00:01:55,733 --> 00:02:03,467
So that, at least temporarily, holds this thing from collapsing even further.

26
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:06,667
And in the case of a less massive star, in the case of a white dwarf,

27
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,667
that's actually how a white dwarf maintains its shape!

28
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,000
Because of the electron degeneracy pressure!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,533
But as this iron core gets even more massive, even more dense,

30
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:22,571
and we get more gravitational pressure, so this is our core now,

31
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:28,733
eventually even the electron degeneracy. . . I guess we could call it

32
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,903
force, or pressure, this outward pressure, this thing that keeps it from collapsing,

33
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:39,067
even that gives in! And then we have something called electron capture!

34
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:49,333
Which is essentially the electrons get captured by protons in the nucleus!

35
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,154
They start collapsing into the nucleus!

36
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:57,470
It's kind of the opposite of beta negative decay, where you have

37
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,400
the electrons getting captured, and protons getting turned into neutrons,

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,000
you have neutrinos being released, but you can imagine an enormous

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,012
amount of energy is also being released! So this is kind of a temporary (state?)

40
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,611
and then all of a sudden, this collapses even more!

41
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:17,933
Until all you have, and all the protons are turning into neutrons, because they're capturing electrons!

42
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:22,467
So then you. . . What you eventually have is this entire core is collapsing

43
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:30,303
into a dense ball of neutrons. You can kind of view them as one

44
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:35,375
really really really massive atom, because it's just

45
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,150
a dense ball of neutrons. And at the same time, when this collapse happens,

46
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:48,809
you have an enormous amount of energy being released in the form of neutrinos!

47
00:03:50,178 --> 00:03:51,775
Did I say that neutrons are being released?

48
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:56,000
No, no no. The electrons are being captured by the protons,

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,092
protons turning into neutrons, this dense ball of neutrons right here,

50
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:02,144
and in the process neutrinos get released!

51
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,645
These fundamental particles, we won't go into the details here,

52
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:11,333
but this enormous amount of energy. . . And this is actually is not really really well understood,

53
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:16,446
of all of the dynamics here, because at the same time that this iron core is undergoing

54
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:21,533
through this first it pauses due to the electron degeneracy pressure, and then

55
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:27,421
it finally gives in because it's so massive, and then it collapses into this dense ball of neutrons,

56
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:32,389
but when it does all of this energy and it's not clear how - because it would have to be

57
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,333
a lot of energy,- because remember, this is a massive star,

58
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,600
so you have a lot of mass in this area over here,

59
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,067
but it's so much energy that that it causes the rest of the star to explode outward!

60
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:53,333
in an unbelievably bright, or energetic, explosion.

61
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,825
And that's called a supernova.

62
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,600
And the reason why it's called nova, it comes from

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,523
(I believe, I'm not an expert here) Latin for new!

64
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:12,292
and the first time people observed a nova, they thought it was a new star!

65
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,893
because something they didn't see before, all of a sudden,it looked like a star had appeared!

66
00:05:15,893 --> 00:05:20,010
because maybe it wasn't bright enough for us to observe it before, but when the nova

67
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,810
occurred, it did become bright enough, it comes from the idea of new!

68
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,561
But a supernova is when you have a pretty massive star, and its core is collapsing,

69
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:35,126
and the energy is being released to explode the rest of the star out at unbelievable velocities.

70
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:40,467
and just to fathom the amount of energy that is being released in a supernova,

71
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:45,400
it can temporarily outshine an entire galaxy! And in a galaxy we're talking about

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,333
hundreds of billions of stars! Or another way to think about it, in that very short period of time,

73
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:54,733
it can release as much energy as the sun will in its entire lifetime!

74
00:05:54,733 --> 00:06:01,140
So these are unbelievably energetic events. And so you actually have the material that's not in the core

75
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,154
being shot out of the star at appreciable percentages of the actual speed of light!

76
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:12,402
So we're talking about things being shot out at up to 10% of the speed of light!

77
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:21,200
That's 30,000 kilometers per SECOND! That's almost circumnavigating the earth every SECOND!

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,728
So that's unbelievably energetic events that we're talking about here.

79
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:33,733
And so if the star, if the original star, (these are rough estimates, people don't have a hard limit here)

80
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:50,256
is 9-20 times the mass of the Sun, then it will supernova, and the core will turn into what is called

81
00:06:50,256 --> 00:07:01,733
a neutron star. Which you can imagine, is just this dense ball of neutrons.

82
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:05,467
And just to give you a sense of it, it'll be something about

83
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:10,817
maybe 2 times the mass of the Sun, give or take, 1.5 - 3 times the mass of the Sun.

84
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:24,810
In a volume that has a diameter on the order of tens of kilometers!

85
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:32,301
So roughly the diameter of a city! So this is unbelievably dense.

86
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:38,338
And we know how much larger the Sun is relative to the Earth,

87
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:43,470
and we know how much larger the Earth is relative to a city, but this is something more massive

88
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,364
than the sun being squeezed into the size of a city. So unbelievably dense.

89
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:54,067
If the original star is even more massive, if it's more than 20 times the Sun,

90
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:12,056
Then even the neutron degeneracy pressure will give up and it will turn into a black hole.

91
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:14,969
And that's - I could go into many of the details on that.

92
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,446
And that's actually an open area of research still, on exactly what's going on inside of a black hole.

93
00:08:19,446 --> 00:08:23,825
But then it turns into a black hole, where essentially all of the mass gets condensed into

94
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:28,733
an infinitely small and dense point, so something unbelievably hard to imagine.

95
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:32,667
And just to give you a sense of it, this will be more mass

96
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:38,480
than even three times the mass of the sun. So we're talking about an incredibly high amount of mass.

97
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:43,633
So just to visualize things, here's a remnant of a supernova,

98
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:55,400
this is the Crab Nebula, and it's about 6500 light years away.

99
00:08:57,477 --> 00:09:02,098
So it's still, from a galactic sense if you think of our galaxy as being 100,000 light years

100
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:05,641
in diameter, it's still not too far from us on those scales.

101
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,929
but it's an enormous distance. the closest star to us is 4 light years away,

102
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,677
and it would take Voyager traveling at 60,000 kilometers/hour

103
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,078
80,000 years to get there.

104
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,558
So this is a very - that's only 4 light years, this is 6,500 light years,

105
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:23,318
but this supernova is believed to have happened 1,000 years ago, right at the center,

106
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:27,979
and so at the center here, we should have a neutron star,

107
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:35,333
and this cloud, this shock wave that you see here, this is the material traveling outwards

108
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:44,733
from that supernova, over 1,000 years. The diameter of this sphere of material is 6 light years.

109
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:58,067
So this is an enormously big shock wave cloud. And we believe that our solar system

110
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:06,157
started to condense because of a shock wave created by a supernova relatively near to us.

111
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:10,410
And just to enter another question that was probably jumping up in the last video,

112
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:17,585
And this is still not really well understood. We talk about how elements up to iron, or maybe nickel,

113
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:20,800
can be formed inside of the cores of massive stars.

114
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,221
So you can imagine, when the star explodes, a lot of that material is released into the universe.

115
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:28,569
And so that's why we have a lot of these materials in our own bodies.

116
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:36,333
In fact, we could not exist if these heavier elements were not formed inside of the cores

117
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:41,065
of primitive stars, stars that have supernovaed a long time ago.

118
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:43,698
Now, the question is how do these heavier elements form?

119
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:46,615
How do we get all of this other stuff on the periodic table?

120
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,728
How do we get all these other heavier elements?

121
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:52,133
And they're formed during the supernova itself.

122
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:56,400
It's so energetic, you have all sorts of particles streaming out, and streaming in,

123
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,267
streaming out because of the force of the shock wave,

124
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,724
streaming in because of the gravity.

125
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:05,733
But you have a mish-mash of elements forming, and that's actually where you have

126
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,223
your heavier elements forming.

127
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:14,658
And because (and I'll talk more about this in future videos) all of the uranium on Earth right now

128
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:17,740
must have been formed in some type of a supernova explosion

129
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,600
(or at least, based on our current understanding). And it looks to be about 4.6 billion years old.

130
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,699
So, given that it looks to be about 4.6 billion years old, based on how fast it's decayed,

131
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:35,229
(and I'll do a whole video on that), that's why we think that our solar system was first formed from some type

132
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:40,733
of supernova explosion. Because that uranium would have been formed right at about

133
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,308
the birth of our solar system. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting,

134
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:48,733
there's a fascinating picture, and if you go to Wikipedia and look up the Crab Nebula,

135
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:52,933
keep clicking on the image and eventually you'll get a zoomed-in picture, and that's just

136
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,637
even more mind-blowing, because you can see all the intricacy in the actual photo.
