1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:03,200
My goal in this video and the next video is to start

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,766
giving a sense of the scale of (really, just) the Earth

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,565
and the solar system, and as we see as we start getting into

4
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,819
(like) the galaxy and the universe

5
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,816
it just becomes almost impossible to imagine

6
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,324
but we'll at least give our best shot.

7
00:00:16,324 --> 00:00:18,460
So I think most of us watching this video know

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,782
that this right here is Earth.

9
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:23,104
This right here is Earth.

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:25,797
And just to get a sense of scale here, I think, probably...

11
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:28,909
probably, the largest distance that we can somehow relate to...

12
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:30,348
is about a hundred miles [ 100 miles ~ 161 km].

13
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:33,135
You can get into a car for about an hour, hour and a half

14
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,064
and go about a hundred miles.

15
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,036
And on the Earth, that would be about THIS far.

16
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,658
It would be a speck that would look something like that.

17
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,701
That is a hundred miles!

18
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,559
And also to get us a bit of scale,

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,135
let's think about a speed that at least we can kind of comprehend.

20
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,643
And that would be maybe the speed of a...

21
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:54,383
Let's think of the speed of a...

22
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:57,191
Bullet. Speed of a bullet.

23
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,584
Maybe we can't comprehend it.

24
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:02,113
But I'll say that this is the fastest thing that we can maybe kind of comprehend.

25
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:03,667
It goes about...

26
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,271
(and there are different types of bullets

27
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,268
depending on the type of gun and all of that)

28
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,101
about 280 meters per second,

29
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:18,000
which is about 1000 kilometers per hour.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,050
And this is also roughly the speed of a jet.

31
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,284
Of a jet...

32
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:32,955
So just to give a sense of scale here, the earth's circumference,

33
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,573
if you were to go around the planet,

34
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:42,075
the earth's circumference, just like that, is about     40 000km

35
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:47,651
40 000km...

36
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,573
So if you were to travel at the speed of a bullet,

37
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,409
speed of a bullet,

38
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,405
or the speed of a jet liner, 1000km/h

39
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:59,072
it would take you 40 hours to circumnavigate the Earth

40
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:05,670
40 hours to go around the Earth...

41
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:09,707
And I think (these) none of these-this information is too surprising

42
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:12,632
you might have taken a 12- or 15-hour flight

43
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,397
that get you, not all the way around the Earth,

44
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:15,400
but get you pretty far:

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,716
San Francisco to Australia, or something like that.

46
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:22,060
So right now these aren't at scales that are too crazy,

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,660
although (you know), even for me, even the Earth itself is a pretty

48
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,725
mindblowingly large object.

49
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,072
Now, (with that out of the way), let's think about

50
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,744
the Sun.

51
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:33,902
Because the Sun starts to approach something far more huge.

52
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:36,735
So this, obviously here, is "the Sun".

53
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:42,133
And I think most people appreciate that the Sun is larger, that it's MUCH larger than the earth,

54
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,957
and that it's pretty far away from the Earth,

55
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,067
but I don't think most people, including myself,

56
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:53,626
fully appreciate how large the Sun is, or how far it is away from the Earth.

57
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:58,457
So just to give you a sense: (the Earth) the Sun has, the Sun is

58
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:07,274
109*circumference of the Earth!

59
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:10,402
Times the circumference of the Earth!

60
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:12,911
So if we do that same thought excersise there

61
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:18,006
if we said: Ok, if i'm travelling at the speed of a bullet, or the speed of a jet liner,

62
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,508
it would take me 40 hours to go around the Earth

63
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:23,179
well, how long would it take to go around the Sun?

64
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:27,911
So if you were to get on a jet plane, and try to go around the Sun,

65
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,800
or if you were to somehow ride a bullet, and try to go around the Sun

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,067
do a complete circumnavigation of the Sun

67
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,019
it's going to take you

68
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,057
109, times, as long as it would have taken you to do the Earth.

69
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:43,980
So it would be 100, times, (I could do 109, but just for approximate)

70
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,069
it's roughly 100*the circumference of the Earth

71
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:52,117
so 100*40=4000

72
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:53,951
4000 hours!

73
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,008
And just to get a sense of what 4000 is

74
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,005
actually, since I have the calculator out

75
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,583
let's do the exact calculation:

76
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:04,320
It's 109*the circumference of the Earth

77
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,667
109*40 hours

78
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,964
that's what it would take you to do a circumference of the Earth.

79
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:14,676
So it's 4360 hours to circumnavigate the Sun,

80
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,974
going at the speed of a bullet, or a jet liner!

81
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,899
And so, that is: (24 hours of the day)

82
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,593
that is 181 days!

83
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:25,265
It would take you roughly half a year

84
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:30,559
it would take half a year to go around the Sun, at the speed of a jet liner.

85
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,673
(let me write this down)

86
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,995
Half a year!

87
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:37,014
half a year...

88
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:39,260
The Sun is HUGE!

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,382
The Sun is huge!

90
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:44,090
Now, that by itself may or may not be strange

91
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,838
Actually, let me give you a sense of scale here

92
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,927
I have this other diagram of a Sun.

93
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,924
This other diagram of a sun...

94
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:52,989
We'll talk more about the rest of the Solar Sytem in the next video.

95
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:56,240
But over here, at this scale, the Sun

96
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,841
the Sun, atleast on my screen, if I were to complete it

97
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,302
it would be about 20 inches in diameter.

98
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,345
The Earth is just this little thing over here!

99
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,250
Smaller, smaller than a raindrop

100
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,336
it's just this small little thing over here.

101
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:12,169
If I were to draw it on this scale, where the Sun is even smaller,

102
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,166
the Earth would be about that,

103
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,835
the Earth would be right about that big.

104
00:05:17,835 --> 00:05:20,342
Now, what isn't obvious, because

105
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:23,315
we've all done our science projects in 3rd and 4th grade,

106
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,983
(or you) we always see these diagrams, of the solar system, that looks something like this:

107
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,327
Is that the planets are WAY further away

108
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,451
even though these are (this is) (these are), uhm

109
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:37,014
depicted to scale, they are WAY further away from the Sun than this makes it look.

110
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:44,840
So the Sun (sorry), the Earth; is 150 million kilometres from the Sun.

111
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,436
So the Earth, Earth is:

112
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:52,061
so this distance, (this is) if this is the Sun right here

113
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,569
if this was the Sun right here, you wouldn't even

114
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,030
at this scale, you wouldn't even be able to see the Earth!

115
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,023
Wouldn't be able to see the Earth...

116
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,867
It wouldn't even be a pixel.

117
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:04,739
But it would be a 150, it would be 150 MILLION

118
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:13,533
150 000 000km from the Earth.

119
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,070
And this distance right here is called an astronomical unit

120
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,467
we'll be using that term in the next few videos

121
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,389
just cause it's an easier way to think about distance.

122
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,383
Sometimes abbreviated "AU": "Astronomical Unit".

123
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,402
Astronomical...

124
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:30,374
Astronomical Unit...

125
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:33,300
And just to give a sense of how far this is

126
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,061
light, which is something that we think is almost infinitily fast

127
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,733
(that, you know) something that looks instantaneous

128
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,402
THAT takes 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to the Earth!

129
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,400
If the Sun were to disappear, it would take 8 minutes for that light,

130
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,739
for us to know, that it disappeared on Earth.

131
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:54,569
Or another way, just to put it in the sense of this jet air plane

132
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,730
let's get the calculator back out

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,259
So we have a hundred, we're talking about 150

134
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,600
that's thousand, million!

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,829
That's 150 million kilometres.

136
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,941
So if we're going at 1000km/hour

137
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,866
going at 1000km/hour, it would take us:

138
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:17,603
150 000 hours, at the speed of a bullet, or the speed of a jet plane

139
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,925
to get to the Sun, and just to (get) put that in perspective:

140
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:25,173
(that) if you wanted it in days: there's 24 hours/day

141
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:30,839
so this would be 6250 days, or if you were to divide by 365:

142
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,426
Roughly 17 years!

143
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:38,269
If you were to shoot a bullet straight at the Sun, it would take 17 years to get there!

144
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,154
If it could maintain it's velocity somehow

145
00:07:40,154 --> 00:07:45,281
So this would take a bullet or a jet plane 17 YEARS to get to the Sun.

146
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,667
17...

147
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,507
17 years...

148
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:51,040
Or another way to visualize it:

149
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,200
This sun right over here looks (on my screen) it has about a 5" or 6" diameter.

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,049
If i were to actually do the scale: This little dot right here,

151
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:03,600
this little dot, which is the Earth, this speck

152
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,786
this speck...

153
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:06,783
If I actually wanted to draw this distance at scale,

154
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:10,963
I would have to put this speck about 50 feet away from the sun

155
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,960
50-60 feet (15-18m) away from the Sun.

156
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,446
If you were looking at the Solar System,

157
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:16,721
and obviously there's other things in the Solar System,

158
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,393
we'll talk more about them in the next video.

159
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:23,316
You wouldn't even notice this speck! Just this little dust thing flying around this Sun.

160
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:26,149
(And we) as we go further and further out of this Solar Sytem we're going to see

161
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,724
even THIS distance starts to become ridiculously small

162
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:31,303
Or another way to think about it:

163
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,229
If the Sun was about this size,

164
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:36,467
If the Sun was about this size...

165
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,477
then this speck, then the Earth on this scale,

166
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,449
would be about 200 feet (60m) away from it!

167
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,050
So you could imagine, if you had a football field,

168
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,533
if you had a football field...

169
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,229
Let me draw a football field...

170
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,133
These are the end zones:

171
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,805
One end zone, another end zone,

172
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,591
and if you were to stick, something maybe the size of a medicine ball,

173
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,239
a little bit bigger than a basketball at one end zone,

174
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:05,065
this little speck would be a- about 60 yards away or (about) roughly 60 metres away

175
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,805
(so this little speck) you wouldn't even notice it, on the scale of a football field!

176
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,477
Something this size.

177
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,124
Anyway, I'm going to leave you there, hopefully that gives you just

178
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:16,443
(eh) starts to blow your mind, when you think about just the scale of the Sun,

179
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:20,251
the Earth, and how far the Earth is away from the Sun.

180
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:23,037
And then we're going to see even those distances, even those scales

181
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:27,031
are super small when you start thinking about the rest of the Solar System,

182
00:09:27,031 --> 99:59:59,999
and especially when we start going beyond the Solar System.
