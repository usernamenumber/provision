00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:02,642
After the last video,

2
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:04,013
if you paid a lot of attention

3
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:05,867
to why Spout wasn't backing up,

4
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,205
you realize that it was because

5
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:08,763
there wasn't enough friction

6
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:10,523
between the axle of the motor

7
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:12,775
and the surface Spout was running on.

8
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:15,354
So we're going to apply some electrical tape

9
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,625
to the axles of the motors

10
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,041
to increase the amount of friction

11
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,903
between the motor and the surface of the table –

12
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:24,945
so when Spout bumps into something,

13
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,023
he's able to back up right away.

14
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,551
So we should see an increase

15
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,163
in both the speed of Spout’s movement

16
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:36,738
and his ability to react to the environment around him.

17
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,841
So let's see how much of a difference it's made.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,693
You can see he's frenetic now.

19
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:56,994
He wants to get out really bad.

20
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:58,490
He wants to go run and play.

21
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,092
So it definitely has improved his ability

22
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,288
to react to the environment around him,

23
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:07,041
and react to the obstacles he faces,

24
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,509
and improve the speed at which he moves.
