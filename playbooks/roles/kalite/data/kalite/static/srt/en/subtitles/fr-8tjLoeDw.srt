Problem number 6. Let f be defined by f of x is equal to, and we have two cases when x is less then or

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,533
equal to zero f is 1 minus two sign of x when x is greater than zero, f is e to the negative four x.

3
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:22,133
show that f is continuous at x equals zero. So for something to be continuous at x equals zero lets think

4
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:28,800
about what has to happen. So if I have a function here, so that is my x axis and lets say that this is

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:39,600
my y axis and we care about what happens at x equals zero, and lets say that this is our function. So

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,133
maybe our function maybe looks something like this. I dont know what it, well this one in particular probably

7
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:51,400
looks something like this. This one in particular, this one in particular might look, who knows, and then

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,067
it might look something like that. And the particulars aren't that important we just have to think about

9
00:00:55,067 --> 00:01:02,467
what they're asking. In order for it to be continuous here, the limit as we approach from the left, the

10
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:12,933
limit as we approach zero from the left should be equal to the value of the function at zero. So the limit

11
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:21,067
of f of x should be equal to f of zero which should be equal to the limit as we approach from the right.

12
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:26,867
Which should be equal to the limit as we approach zero from the right, so that should be equal to the

13
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:33,600
limit as x approaches zero from the right of f of x. And the reason that this matters is if this wasn't

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,823
the case, if f of zero wasn't the same as a limit then we might have a gap right over there, so you could

15
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:47,200
have limits. So you could have a situation like this, where you have a gap right over there and looks something

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,133
like that. So the two limits from the left and the right both exist and the limit at that point would

17
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:58,600
exist, but if the function itself doesnt equal that value there, if it equals something else, then the function

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,467
would not be continuous. So thats why the limit has to be equal to the value of the function in order

19
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:11,733
for it to be continuous. So lets think about whether all of these things equal each other. First of all

20
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:19,482
lets just think about the value of the function there. So we're doing part A, F of zero is equal to, we're

21
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:24,400
going to use this first case cause thats the case for x is less than or equal to zero, so f of zero is

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:37,267
going to be equal to one minus two sign of zero. Sign of zero is zero, two times zero is zero, so this whole

23
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:48,467
thing is zero. 1 minus 0 is 1. Fair enough. Now, lets think about the limit as x approaches zero from the

24
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:58,467
left hand side of f of x. So as we approach the zero from the left hand side we're dealing with this first

25
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:11,400
case up here. So this is the limit as x approaches zero from the left hand side of 1 minus 2 sign of

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,533
x. Now sign of x is continuous its a continuous function so this is going to be the same thing as 1 minus

27
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:24,800
2 sign of zero which we've already figured out which is exactly equal to 1. So this is equal to one.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,533
So the value of the limit as we approach from the left is the same as the value of the function. Now

29
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:35,200
lets do it as we approach from the right. As we approach from values of x greater than zero. So lets

30
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,133
think about the limit as we approach 0 from the right of f of x. So here we're dealing with values of

31
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:48,267
x that are larger than 0 so we're dealing with this case right over here so thats going to be the limit

32
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:56,933
as x approaches zero from the right of e to the negative 4x. And for the x's that we care about, or actually

33
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:03,275
in general, this is a continuous function. This is a continuous function, so this is going to be the same

34
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:09,400
thing as e to the negative 4 times 0, which is just e to the zero, which is just one. So this once again

35
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,733
is equal to one. So the function is equal to one, at that point the limit as we approach from the left

36
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:21,248
is equal to 1 and the limit as we approach from the right is equal to one. So the function is continuous

37
00:04:21,248 --> 99:59:59,999
there.
