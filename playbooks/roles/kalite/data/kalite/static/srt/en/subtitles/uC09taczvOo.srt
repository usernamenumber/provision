1
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:04,036
Plot the following numbers on the number line.

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:07,800
So the first number we have here is five.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,821
And so five is five to the right of zero. Five is right over there.

4
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:21,933
Then we get one third. So one third is between zero and one.

5
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,990
And we can actually split this into thirds:

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,075
So that would be one third, two thirds, and then three thirds which is one.

7
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,462
So one third is going to sit right over there.

8
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,523
It's one third of the way from zero to one.

9
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:37,767
That's one third, right over there.

10
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:47,000
We have negative one point two. So negative one is right over here.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,898
This is is more negative than negative one.

12
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:54,462
It's negative one point two. It's negative one and then another point two.

13
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,164
So it is going to be right over here.

14
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:02,867
So this is negative one point two.

15
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:06,933
Zero is pretty straight forward. Zero is right over there.

16
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,667
It's even labeled for us at the zero.

17
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:11,933
Five was labeled for us too at five.

18
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:17,323
We have negative two and one fourth. So let's go to negative two.

19
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:22,523
Negative two is here. It's more negative than negative two.

20
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,892
It's negative two and then another negative one fourth.

21
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:30,282
So it's negative two and then we go one fourth of the way to negative three.

22
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:38,338
So negative two and one fourth is is going to be right over here.

23
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:43,333
And then finally we have four point one. So four is right over here.

24
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:48,403
Point one is another tenth greater than four. Another tenth on the way to five.

25
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:51,785
So four and one tenth is going to be right over here.

26
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:57,100
Four point one. And we are done.
