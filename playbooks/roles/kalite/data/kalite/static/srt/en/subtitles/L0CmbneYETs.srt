1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,340
I have here three equations
of four unknowns.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,530
You can already guess, or you
already know, that if you have

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,540
more unknowns than equations,
you are probably not

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,340
constraining it enough.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,800
You actually are going
to have an

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,360
infinite number of solutions.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,320
Those infinite number of
solutions could still be

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,180
constrained.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,400
Let's say we're in four
dimensions, in this case,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,810
because we have four
variables.

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,350
Maybe we were constrained into a
plane in four dimensions, or

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,740
if we were in three dimensions,
maybe we're

13
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,750
constrained to a line.

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,640
A line is an infinite number of
solutions, but it's a more

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,100
constrained set.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,700
Let's solve this set of
linear equations.

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,830
We've done this by elimination
in the past. What I want to do

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,950
is I want to introduce
the idea of matrices.

19
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,770
The matrices are really just
arrays of numbers that are

20
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,390
shorthand for this system
of equations.

21
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,800
Let me create a matrix here.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,880
I could just create a
coefficient matrix, where the

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,280
coefficient matrix would just
be, let me write it neatly,

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,730
the coefficient matrix would
just be the coefficients on

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,340
the left hand side of these
linear equations.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,570
The coefficient there is 1.

27
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,980
The coefficient there is 1.

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,930
The coefficient there is 2.

29
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,750
You have 2, 2, 4.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,860
2, 2, 4.

31
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,820
1, 2, 0.

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,360
1, 2, there is no coefficient
the x3 term here, because

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,920
there is no x3 term there.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,710
We'll say the coefficient on
the x3 term there is 0.

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,210
And then we have 1,
minus 1, and 6.

36
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,360
Now if I just did this right
there, that would be the

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,210
coefficient matrix for
this system of

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,600
equations right there.

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,240
What I want to do is I want to
augment it, I want to augment

40
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,780
it with what these equations
need to be equal to.

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,320
Let me augment it.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,520
What I am going to do is I'm
going to just draw a little

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,000
line here, and write the
7, the 12, and the 4.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,030
I think you can see that
this is just another

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,800
way of writing this.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,510
And just by the position, we
know that these are the

47
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,910
coefficients on the x1 terms.
We know that these are the

48
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,789
coefficients on the x2 terms.
And what this does, it really

49
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,790
just saves us from having to
write x1 and x2 every time.

50
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,140
We can essentially do the same
operations on this that we

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,810
otherwise would have
done on that.

52
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,560
What we can do is, we can
replace any equation with that

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,020
equation times some
scalar multiple,

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,210
plus another equation.

55
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,110
We can divide an equation,
or multiply an

56
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,390
equation by a scalar.

57
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,810
We can subtract them
from each other.

58
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,230
We can swap them.

59
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,320
Let's do that in an attempt
to solve this equation.

60
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,180
The first thing I want to do,
just like I've done in the

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,220
past, I want to get this
equation into the form of,

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,180
where if I can, I have a 1.

63
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,910
My leading coefficient in
any of my rows is a 1.

64
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,270
And that every other entry
in that column is a 0.

65
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,180
In the past, I made sure
that every other entry

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,300
below it is a 0.

67
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,950
That's what I was doing in some
of the previous videos,

68
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,420
when we tried to figure out
of things were linearly

69
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,620
independent, or not.

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,215
Now I'm going to make sure that
if there is a 1, if there

71
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:08,040
is a leading 1 in any of my
rows, that everything else in

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,290
that column is a 0.

73
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,260
That form I'm doing is called
reduced row echelon form.

74
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,000
Let me write that.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Reduced row echelon form.

76
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,450
If we call this augmented
matrix, matrix A, then I want

77
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,240
to get it into the reduced row
echelon form of matrix A.

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,410
And matrices, the convention
is, just like vectors, you

79
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,740
make them nice and bold, but use
capital letters, instead

80
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,770
of lowercase letters.

81
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,550
We'll talk more about how
matrices relate to vectors in

82
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,530
the future.

83
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,810
Let's just solve this
system of equations.

84
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,820
The first thing I want to do is,
in an ideal world I would

85
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,530
get all of these guys
right here to be 0.

86
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,090
Let me replace this guy with
that guy, with the first entry

87
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,390
minus the second entry.

88
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,640
Let me do that.

89
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,030
The first row isn't
going to change.

90
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,900
It's going to be 1, 2, 1, 1.

91
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,560
And then I get a
7 right there.

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,910
That's my first row.

93
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,930
Now the second row, I'm going
to replace it with the first

94
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,890
row minus the second row.

95
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,770
So what do I get.

96
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,840
1 minus 1 is 0.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,380
2 minus 2 is 0.

98
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,120
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,800
And then 1 minus minus 1 is 2.

100
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,630
That's 1 plus 1.

101
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,710
And then 7 minus
12 is minus 5.

102
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,610
Now I want to get rid
of this row here.

103
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,360
I don't want to get rid of it.

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,940
I want to get rid of
this 2 right here.

105
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,830
I want to turn it into a 0.

106
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,350
Let's replace this row
with this row minus

107
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,040
2 times that row.

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,360
What I'm going to do is,
this row minus 2

109
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,420
times the first row.

110
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm going to replace
this row with that.

111
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,730
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

112
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,050
That was the whole point.

113
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,690
4 minus 2 times 2 is 0.

114
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,310
0 minus 2 times 1 is minus 2.

115
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:26,430
6 minus 2 times 1 is 6
minus 2, which is 4.

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:36,835
4 minus 2 times 7, is 4 minus
14, which is minus 10.

117
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,210
Now what can I do next.

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,770
You can kind of see that this
row, well talk more about what

119
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,590
this row means.

120
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,860
When all of a sudden it's all
been zeroed out, there's

121
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,730
nothing here.

122
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,870
If I had non-zero term here,
then I'd want to zero this guy

123
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,880
out, although it's already
zeroed out.

124
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm just going to move
over to this row.

125
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,990
The first thing I want to do is
I want to make this leading

126
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,930
coefficient here a 1.

127
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,260
What I want to do is, I'm going
to multiply this entire

128
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,840
row by minus 1.

129
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,040
If I multiply this entire
row times minus 1.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
I don't even have to
rewrite the matrix.

131
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,940
This becomes plus 1,
minus 2, plus 5.

132
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,260
I think you can accept that.

133
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,420
Now what can we do?

134
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,290
Well, let's turn this
right here into a 0.

135
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:32,820
Let me rewrite my augmented
matrix in the new form that I

136
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,860
have. I'm going to keep the
middle row the same this time.

137
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,940
My middle row is 0, 0, 1,
minus 2, and then it's

138
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,710
augmented, and I
get a 5 there.

139
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,330
What I want to do is I want to
eliminate this minus 2 here.

140
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,420
Why don't I add this row
to 2 times that row.

141
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,600
Then I would have minus 2, plus
2, and that'll work out.

142
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,450
What do I get.

143
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,900
Well, these are just
leading 0's.

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,540
Then I have minus 2,
plus 2 times 1.

145
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,680
That's just 0.

146
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:17,830
4 plus 2 times minus
2, that is minus 4.

147
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,310
That's 4 plus minus 4,
that's 0 as well.

148
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,720
Then you have minus
10 plus 2 times 5.

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,200
Well, that's just minus 10
plus 10, which is 0.

150
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,970
That one just got zeroed out.

151
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,400
Normally, when I just did
regular elimination, I was

152
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,110
happy just having the situation
where I had these

153
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,790
leading 1's.

154
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,420
Everything below it were 0's.

155
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,100
I wasn't too concerned about
what was above our 1's.

156
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,320
What I want to do is,
I want to make

157
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,730
those into a 0 as well.

158
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,920
I want to make this
guy a 0 as well.

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,170
What I can do is, I can replace
this first row with

160
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,740
that first row minus
this second row.

161
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,680
What is 1 minus 0?

162
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,200
That's just 1.

163
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,900
2 minus 0 is 2.

164
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,770
1 minus 1 is 0.

165
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,830
1 minus minus 2 is 3.

166
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,540
7 minus 5 is 2.

167
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,810
There you have it.

168
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,970
We have our matrix in reduced
row echelon form.

169
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,350
This is the reduced row echelon
form of our matrix,

170
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,950
I'll write it in bold, of our
matrix A right there.

171
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,620
You know it's in reduced row
echelon form because all of

172
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,360
your leading 1's in each
row-- so what are my

173
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,420
leading 1's in each row?

174
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,880
I have this 1 and
I have that 1.

175
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,020
They're the only non-zero
entry in their columns.

176
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,760
These are called the
pivot entries.

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,290
Let me label that for you.

178
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,080
That's called a pivot entry.

179
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,810
Pivot entry.

180
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,700
They're the only non-zero
entry in

181
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,320
their respective columns.

182
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,080
If I have any zeroed out rows,
and I do have a zeroed out

183
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,930
row, it's right there.

184
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,660
This is zeroed out row.

185
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,330
Just the style, or just the
convention, is that for

186
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,200
reduced row echelon form, that
has to be your last row.

187
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,250
We have the leading entries are
the only -- they're all 1.

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,020
That's one case.

189
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,980
You can't have this a 5.

190
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,410
You'd want to divide that
equation by 5 if this was a 5.

191
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,730
So your leading entries
in each row are a 1.

192
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,760
That the leading entry in each
successive row is to the right

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,120
of the leading entry of
the row before it.

194
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,290
This guy right here is to
the right of that guy.

195
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,400
This is just the style, the
convention, of reduced row

196
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,790
echelon form.

197
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,630
If you have any zeroed out rows,
it's in the last row.

198
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,930
And finally, of course, and I
think I've said this multiple

199
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,860
times, this is the only non-zero
entry in the row.

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,430
What does this do for me?

201
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,460
Now I can go back from
this world, back

202
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,850
to my linear equations.

203
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,860
We remember that these were the
coefficients on x1, these

204
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,260
were the coefficients on x2.

205
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,350
These were the coefficients on
x3, on x4, and then these were

206
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,000
my constants out here.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,730
I can rewrite this system of
equations using my reduced row

208
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:18,900
echelon form as x1,
x1 plus 2x2.

209
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,500
There's no x3 there.

210
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,000
So plus 3x4 is equal to 2.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,190
This equation, no x1,
no x2, I have an x3.

212
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:38,310
I have x3 minus 2x4
is equal to 5.

213
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,490
I have no other equation here.

214
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,440
This one got completely
zeroed out.

215
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,490
I was able to reduce this system
of equations to this

216
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,280
system of equations.

217
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,430
The variables that you associate
with your pivot

218
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,160
entries, we call these
pivot variables.

219
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,225
x1 and x3 are pivot variables.

220
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,670
The variables that aren't
associated with the pivot

221
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,810
entry, we call them
free variables.

222
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:12,140
x2 and x4 are free variables.

223
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,540
Now let's solve for, essentially
you can only solve

224
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,620
for your pivot variables.

225
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,370
The free variables we can
set to any variable.

226
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,960
I said that in the beginning
of this equation.

227
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,370
We have fewer equations
than unknowns.

228
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,940
This is going to be a not well
constrained solution.

229
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,170
You're not going to have just
one point in R4 that solves

230
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:31,550
this equation.

231
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,020
You're going to have
multiple points.

232
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,860
Let's solve for our pivot
variables, because that's all

233
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,360
we can solve for.

234
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,170
This equation tells us, right
here, it tells us x3, let me

235
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:59,960
do it in a good color, x3
is equal to 5 plus 2x4.

236
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:12,050
Then we get x1 is equal to
2 minus x2, 2 minus 2x2.

237
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:20,560
2 minus 2x2 plus, sorry,
minus 3x4.

238
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,930
I just subtracted these from
both sides of the equation.

239
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,630
This right here is essentially
as far as we can go to the

240
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,180
solution of this system
of equations.

241
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,730
I can pick, really, any values
for my free variables.

242
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,155
I can pick any values for my
x2's and my x4's and I can

243
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,540
solve for x3.

244
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,560
What I want to do right now is
write this in a slightly

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,510
different form so we can
visualize a little bit better.

246
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,680
Of course, it's always hard to
visualize things in four

247
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,530
dimensions.

248
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,840
So we can visualize things a
little bit better, as to the

249
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,810
set of this solution.

250
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,680
Let's write it this way.

251
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,260
If I were to write it in vector
form, our solution is

252
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,070
the vector x1, x2, x3, x4.

253
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,320
What is it equal to?

254
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,270
Well it's equal to-- let
me write it like this.

255
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,370
It's equal to-- I'm just
rewriting, I'm just

256
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,700
essentially rewriting this
solution set in vector form.

257
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,360
So x1 is equal to 2-- let
me write a little column

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,250
there-- plus x2.

259
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,000
Let me write it this way.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,540
Plus x2 times something plus
x4 times something.

261
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:45,280
x1 is equal to 2 minus 2 times
x2, or plus x2 minus 2.

262
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,450
I put a minus 2 there.

263
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,820
I can say plus x4
times minus 3.

264
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,430
I can put a minus 3 there.

265
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,300
This right here, the first
entries of these vectors

266
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,690
literally represent that
equation right there. x1 is

267
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:06,590
equal to 2 plus x2 times minus
2 plus x4 times minus 3.

268
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,505
What does x3 equal?

269
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,600
x3 is equal to 5.

270
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,090
Put that 5 right there.

271
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,930
Plus x4 times 2.

272
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
x2 doesn't apply to it.

273
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
We can just put a 0.

274
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,570
0 times x2 plus 2 times x4.

275
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,430
Now what does x2 equal?

276
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,000
You could say, x2 is equal
to 0 plus 1 times x2

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,090
plus 0 times x4.

278
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,430
x2 is just equal to x2.

279
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,750
It's a free variable.

280
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,600
Similarly, what does
x4 equal to?

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:50,020
x4 is equal to 0 plus 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x4.

282
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,770
What does this do for us?

283
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,250
Well, all of a sudden here,
we've expressed our solution

284
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,170
set as essentially the linear
combination of the linear

285
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,360
combination of three vectors.

286
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,040
This is a vector.

287
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,290
You can view it as
a coordinate.

288
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,590
Either a position vector.

289
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,140
It is a vector in R4.

290
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,440
You can view it as a position
vector or a coordinate in R4.

291
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,230
You could say, look, our
solution set is essentially--

292
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,290
this is in R4.

293
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,770
Each of these have four
components, but you can

294
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,640
imagine it in r3.

295
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,130
That my solution set
is equal to some

296
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,180
vector, some vector there.

297
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,190
That's the vector.

298
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,800
Think of it is as a
position vector.

299
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,210
It would be the coordinate
2, 0, 5, 0.

300
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,590
Which obviously, this is four
dimensions right there.

301
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:42,160
It's equal to multiples
of these two vectors.

302
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,380
Let's call this vector,
right here, let's

303
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,650
call this vector a.

304
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,390
Let's call this vector,
right here, vector b.

305
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,650
Our solution set is all of this
point, which is right

306
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,440
there, or I guess we could call
it that position vector.

307
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,590
That position vector will
look like that.

308
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,560
Where you're starting at the
origin right there, plus

309
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,745
multiples of these two guys.

310
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:11,390
If this is vector a, let's do
vector a in a different color.

311
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,330
Vector a looks like that.

312
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,260
Let's say vector a looks like
that, and then vector

313
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,620
b looks like that.

314
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,660
This is vector b, and
this is vector a.

315
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,690
I don't know if this is going to
be easier or harder for you

316
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,720
to visualize, because obviously
we are dealing in

317
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,340
four dimensions right here, and
I'm just drawing on a two

318
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,910
dimensional surface.

319
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,260
What you can imagine is, is that
the solution set is equal

320
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,040
to this fixed point, this
position vector, plus linear

321
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,490
combinations of a and b.

322
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,530
We're dealing, of
course, in R4.

323
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,310
Let me write that down.

324
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,030
We're dealing in R4.

325
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,770
But linear combinations
of a and b are

326
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,930
going to create a plane.

327
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,850
You can multiply a times 2,
and b times 3, or a times

328
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,120
minus 1, and b times
minus 100.

329
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,450
You can keep adding and
subtracting these linear

330
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,230
combinations of a and b.

331
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,960
They're going to construct
a plane that contains the

332
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,710
position vector, or contains
the point 2, 0, 5, 0.

333
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:16,760
The solution for these three
equations with four unknowns,

334
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,660
is a plane in R4.

335
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,140
I know that's really hard to
visualize, and maybe I'll do

336
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,010
another one in three
dimensions.

337
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,890
Hopefully this at least gives
you a decent understanding of

338
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,570
what an augmented matrix is,
what reduced row echelon form

339
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,470
is, and what are the valid
operations I can perform on a

340
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,320
matrix without messing
up the system.
