1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,780
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,590
I'm now going to do a
series of videos on the

4
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:05,430
trigonometric identities.

5
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,250
So let's just review what
we already know about the

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,920
trig function, so let me
just write SOHCAHTOA.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,960
   

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,320
That tells us, and we've
actually extended this with the

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,670
unit circle definition, but if
you watch those videos, you'll

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,040
realize that the unit circle
definition directly

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,910
uses SOHCAHTOA.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,690
So we'll just stick with
SOHCAHTOA because I think it'll

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,690
help make some of what we're
about to do seem a little bit

14
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,380
more straightforward and will
kind of verge on the unit

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,760
circle definition anyway.

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:40,150
So we know that sine of
theta is equal to opposite

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,390
over hypotenuse, right?

18
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:49,290
So cosine of theta is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse, and

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,930
then the tangent of theta is
equal to opposite

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,310
over adjacent.

21
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,420
So let's draw that out
on a right triangle.

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,230
We could do this with the
unit circle as well, and

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,590
it would make sense.

24
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,960
Let's see if we can find a
relationship between sine,

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,760
cosine and tangent.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,915
There's my right triangle.

27
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:14,490
   

28
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,690
Let's call this theta.

29
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,910
This is the hypotenuse h.

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,820
This is the opposite side,
right, opposite of theta.

31
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,480
This is theta right here.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,090
This is the adjacent
side, right?

33
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,940
Well, what do we know about
the relationship between

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,860
the opposite adjacent side
and then the hypotenuse?

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,030
What does the Pythagorean
theorem tell us?

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,350
Oh, yeah, this side squared
plus this side squared is equal

37
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,290
to the hypotenuse squared,
so we could write that down.

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:48,100
a squared plus o squared is
equal to the hypotenuse

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
squared, right?

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,980
And then this is just an
equation, so if we want to, we

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,620
could divide both sides of this
equation by h squared,

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,790
and so what do we get?

43
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:07,880
We get a squared over h squared
plus o squared over h squared

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,590
is equal to 1, right?

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:22,070
And then I could rewrite that
as a over h squared plus o

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,710
over h squared is equal to 1.

47
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,930
Now, do these look
at all familiar?

48
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,080
Well, we have them here, right?

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,570
This is a over h, this is
o over h, so we could

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,750
just substitute.

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,280
So this is just cosine
of theta squared.

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,520
And this is how you
write cosine squared.

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,280
You could put a parentheses
around the whole thing and then

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,760
square it, but this is just
the notation people use.

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,510
Plus opposite over adjacent
squared, so that's sine theta

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,280
squared is equal to 1.

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,530
So that's our first
trig identity.

58
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,440
So if you know the sine of
theta, it's very easy to figure

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
out the cosine of theta, right?

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,550
You could just solve
this equation.

61
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,430
If I know that the--
I don't know.

62
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:14,050
Let's say I know that the
sine of theta is 1/2, right?

63
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,351
Then what is the
cosine of theta?

64
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:18,630
The cosine of theta is what?

65
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,950
Well, I know the sine of
theta is 1/2, right?

66
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,160
So I would say cosine squared
of theta plus sine of theta

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,770
is 1/2, so 1/2 squared
is equal to 1, right?

68
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,480
So cosine squared theta
plus 1/4 is equal to 1.

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,870
So we have cosine squared theta
is equal to 3/4, or cosine of

70
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,830
theta would be the square
root of this, right?

71
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,010
We just take the square
root of both sides.

72
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,510
It would be the
square root of 3/2.

73
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,770
And you probably remember that
from our whole presentation

74
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,900
on the 30-60-90 triangle.

75
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,400
So I just wanted to show you
a use of this trig identity

76
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
that's usually written
sine squared plus cosine

77
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,860
squared is equal to 1.

78
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,740
So let's extend that
one a little bit.

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,750
Let's just play with the ratios
and see what else we can--

80
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,950
other identities
we can discover.

81
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,180
Whoops!

82
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,370
Clear image, invert colors.

83
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:28,310
So we know that sine squared
theta plus cosine squared

84
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,390
theta is equal to 1.

85
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,220
The one thing we could do is we
could divide both sides of this

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,880
equation by cosine squared of
theta, and let's just see what

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,260
happens when we do that.

88
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,020
So if we say cosine
squared theta, right?

89
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,530
You have to distribute
across both terms.

90
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:57,710
Cosine squared of theta, and
then cosine squared of theta.

91
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,360
Well, what's sine squared theta
over cosine squared theta?

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,720
That's the same thing as sine
of theta over cosine of theta

93
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:16,550
squared plus this is 1 over
cosine theta squared, right?

94
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,240
I mean, 1 squared is 1,
so I just rewrote it.

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,980
So sine over cosine theta, I
think we learned that already.

96
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,410
That's just the
tangent of theta.

97
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,000
   

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,280
And in case you actually
haven't learned that already,

99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,190
think about it this way.

100
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,030
Sine is opposite over
the hypotenuse, right?

101
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,350
So that's opposite
over hypotenuse.

102
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,410
And then cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse.

103
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,290
So adjacent over hypotenuse.

104
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,350
So then that equals opposite
over hypotenuse times

105
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,030
hypotenuse over
adjacent, right?

106
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,720
Just dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
by its reciprocal.

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
That's all I did.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,780
And that equals opposite
over adjacent, right?

110
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,290
   

111
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,930
So that just says sine of
theta over cosine of theta is

112
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,720
equal to tangent of theta.

113
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,270
So sine squared theta over
cosine squared theta is tan

114
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:15,310
squared theta, then plus 1 is
1 over cosine theta squared.

115
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,300
And now I'm going to introduce
a new trig ratio, it's really

116
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,800
just 1 over cosine theta.

117
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,945
So 1 over cosine theta-- and
I'm going to summarize this at

118
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:28,050
the end, just so it's not too
confusing-- is actually

119
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,340
the secant of theta.

120
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,780
And this is just
another ratio, right?

121
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,170
The secant of theta, instead of
being the adjacent over the

122
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,580
hypotenuse, would be the
hypotenuse over the

123
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,180
adjacent, right?

124
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,370
It's just 1 over cosine theta.

125
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,710
Nothing fancy here.

126
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,000
So secant of theta.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,580
So that equals secant
squared of theta.

128
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,280
I know it can be a little
overwhelming initially, just

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,750
because I'm, you know, throwing
out all these new terms, secant

130
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,670
is 1 over cosine theta, but
once you just play around with

131
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,790
these enough and get familiar
with the terms, it'll make

132
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,130
sense, and it'll be a little
more natural to you.

133
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,760
So this could be-- you
could view this as

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,970
another trig identity.

135
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,160
And actually, I don't
even remember if I've

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,690
taught it already.

137
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,460
I mean, you could view this as
a trig identity, although

138
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,110
that's almost definitional.

139
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,730
And then, of course, you can--
in case I haven't done it

140
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:18,340
already, you now know that sine
of theta over cosine of theta

141
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,570
is equal to tangent of theta.

142
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,210
And that's right here
with, I guess you could

143
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,770
say, the proof of it.

144
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,750
So let me keep introducing you
to more things, and if this is

145
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,540
really daunting, maybe you
just can rewatch it, and

146
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,890
hopefully, it'll make sense.

147
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,810
Let me see, clear image.

148
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,150
So what have we learned so far?

149
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,540
We learned that sine squared
theta plus cosine squared

150
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
theta is equal to 1.

151
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,880
We learned that sine of theta
over cosine of theta is

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,700
equal to tangent of theta.

153
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,750
We learned that the tangent
squared of theta plus 1 is

154
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,650
equal to the secant of theta.

155
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,030
And here, let me actually
write this definition down.

156
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,675
The secant of theta-- oops,
is equal to the secant

157
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,790
squared of theta, sorry.

158
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,800
And the secant of theta is
just 1 over cosine of theta.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,670
This is something you really
should just memorize, that

160
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,950
secant is 1 over cosine.

161
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,430
And if you're wondering what 1
over sine is, 1 over sine of

162
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:33,350
theta, it's the cosecant-- the
abbreviation is csc-- of theta.

163
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,690
And if you're wondering what
1 over the tangent is,

164
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,730
it's the cotangent.

165
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,660
And you just might want
to memorize these.

166
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,600
And this often confuses me,
that 1 over the cosine is the

167
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,340
secant, but 1 over the sine is
the cosecant, so it's kind of

168
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,250
almost the opposite, right?

169
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,230
1 over the sine has a co in
it, while 1 over the cosine

170
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,060
doesn't have the co in it.

171
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,150
So that might help
you remember things.

172
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,760
So I think that's all
I have time for now.

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,120
In the next presentation, I'm
going to introduce you to a

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,575
couple more trig identities.

175
00:09:07,575 --> 00:09:09,380
See you soon.

176
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,400
