1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,735
We know the US is running a relatively large deficit relative to China in 2009

2
00:00:06,735 --> 00:00:13,302
We imported 260 billion more than we exported to China

3
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:16,000
and we know from the last two videos that the way,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,225
the way the China is keeping their currency from appreciating

5
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:22,175
because of this trade imbalance

6
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,497
is that they are going out there printing money

7
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:28,212
and using that Yuan to buy Dollar assets

8
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:34,180
And we see over here in (2006), (2007), (2008) major increase in US assets.

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,897
But what's little bit more interesting is 2009

10
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:41,401
we didn't have a huge increase. Its pretty large by any standard

11
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,256
but not large enough to offset the actual trade imbalance

12
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:48,138
So how did China keep its currency pegged.

13
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:51,154
Even better, lets actually look at ... because this isn't just the Chinese government.

14
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:55,147
These are just ownership of US assets by Chinese nationals.

15
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:59,234
We can actually look at the major foreign holders of treasury securities.

16
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:05,011
this actually comes from the Treasury's own website

17
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:08,978
and it tells us how much different Central Banks are,

18
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:13,267
how many treasury securities they are actually holding

19
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:17,253
You can see China is the biggest holder. It is the biggest holder

20
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:22,222
If you go to November of 2009 it has 929 billion dollars

21
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:29,174
This is the Peoples Bank of China has 929 billion dollars worth of US treasuries.

22
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,417
But whats interesting here it is the largest holder

23
00:01:31,417 --> 00:01:35,977
but as we go from November of 2009 to November of 2010,

24
00:01:35,977 --> 00:01:38,894
their holdings actually went down not by a ton.

25
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:42,563
they are still right around 900 billion but they went down.

26
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:45,581
So given the fact that we have this trade deficit,

27
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:48,933
given the fact they want to peg their currency

28
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,572
and they want to print money and go buy other people's assets,

29
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:56,050
how did this happen. How did the number of treasuries actually go down.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:03,230
And actually how did they were able to reduce the amount of all US assets that they bought

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,600
Now the treasury answer is they don't have to just buy treasuries.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,916
they could buy other US assets. But you go over here

33
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:16,062
we saw they didn‘t buy a ton of other US assets and a clue to what's happening here

34
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:18,089
and this isn't exactly what necessarily happening,

35
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,829
it is far more complicated than I can explain in one video.

36
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,244
But we do see other countries whose

37
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:27,851
US treasury holdings are increasing dramatically over the course of 2010.

38
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,581
In particular you see the United Kingdom.

39
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:33,554
You see the United Kingdom. Their holdings have grown

40
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:39,669
from 155 billion to 500 billion over the course of 2010 and this is relative.

41
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,585
United Kingdom does not have a significant trade imbalance

42
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,232
one way or the other with the United States

43
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,871
and we actually see, we actually see that

44
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:53,151
its currency really didn't change much over the course of 2010.

45
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,258
It‘s been about, it’s been about the same and

46
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,093
this looks more dramatic than it really is.

47
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,907
So the answer and it could be much more complicated,

48
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:03,988
and this is that China has decided to somewhat diversify

49
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:07,873
from buying US treasuries, and in particular US assets

50
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:10,985
and maybe they are diversifying to the pound sterling

51
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,911
maybe they are diversifying to the Euro and so they'll start buying,

52
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:18,161
they'll start buying, say, British assets.

53
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,667
But the British don't want their currency

54
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:24,136
to appreciate too much because then they will suffer a trade consequences.

55
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,785
Their goods will be too expensive

56
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,650
and so the British Central Bank will then want to, maybe,

57
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,964
-- so that their currency does not appreciate relative to the dollar --

58
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:35,322
they'll want to go and buy american assets.

59
00:03:35,322 --> 00:03:37,336
And that's what it looks like its actually happening.

60
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,860
And maybe one other small point is that

61
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,067
the Chinese government has slowly allowed its currency to appreciate

62
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:47,579
but the appreciation isn't as dramatic as this chart makes it look.

63
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:56,111
This is 6.8 Yuan to the dollar at the beginning of 2010 to about 6.6.

64
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:00,120
We are not getting close to zero here. This is just from 6.8 to 6.6.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,498
But over the last several years

66
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,037
they have slowly been allowing their currency to appreciate

67
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:08,732
but what's really happening is that they are diversifying away from dollar assets.

68
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,480
When they buy those other currencies

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,929
those people are going to wanna buy dollar assets to keep their currencies from moving too much.
