1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Let's do some more
nonhomogeneous equations.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,660
So let's take the same problem,
but we'll change the

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,360
right-hand side.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,200
Because I think you know how
to solve the-- essentially,

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,300
the homogeneous version.

7
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,810
So the same problem as we
did in the last video.

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,380
The second derivative of y
minus 3 times the first

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,750
derivative y minus 4
times the function.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,940
And now in the last example,
the nonhomogeneous part

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,200
was 3e to the 2x.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,390
But we're tired of dealing with
exponent functions, so

13
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,880
let's make it a trigonometric
function.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,350
So let's say it equals
2 sin of x.

15
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,740
So the first step you do is
what we've been doing.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,510
You essentially solve the
homogeneous equation.

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,890
So this left-hand side
is equal to 0.

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,150
You do that by getting the
characteristic equation r

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,160
squared minus 3r minus
4 is equal to 0.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,360
You get the solutions, r is
equal equal to 4, r is equal

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,840
to minus 1, and then you get
that general solution.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,080
We did this in the last video.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,600
You get the general solution
of the homogeneous.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,129
Maybe we'll call this the
homogeneous solution.

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,580
y homogeneous.

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:14,840
We've got the C1 e to the 4x
plus C2e to the minus x.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,480
And that's all and good, but
in order to get the general

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,410
solution of this nonhomogeneous
equation, I

29
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,590
have to take the solution of the
nonhomogeneous equation,

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,280
if this were equal to 0, and
then add that to a particular

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,050
solution that satisfies
this equation.

32
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,300
That satisfies-- when you take
the second derivative minus 3

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,400
times the first minus 4 times
the function, I actually

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,470
get 2 sin of x.

35
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,130
And here once again we'll use
undetermined coefficients.

36
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,170
And undetermined coefficients,
just think to yourself.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,650
What function, when I take its
second and first derivatives

38
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,530
and add and subtract multiples
of them to each other, will I

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,980
get sine of x?

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,835
Well, two functions end up with
sine of x when you take

41
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:55,230
the first and second
derivatives.

42
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,050
And the sine and cosine of x.

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,960
So it's a good guess.

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,630
And that's really what you're
doing it the method of

45
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,970
undetermined coefficients.

46
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,360
You take a guess of a particular
solution and then

47
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,400
you solve for the undetermined
coefficients.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:15,710
So let's say that our guess is
y is equal to-- I don't know,

49
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,930
some coefficient times
sine of x.

50
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,020
And if this was sine
of 2x, I'd put A

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,920
times sine of 2x here.

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,170
Just because I still want-- no
matter what happens here-- the

53
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,690
sine of 2x's or maybe cosine
of 2x's to still exist. If

54
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,730
this was a sine of 2x, there's
nothing I could do to a sine

55
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,920
of x, or nothing at least
trivial that I could do

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,640
to the sine of x.

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,340
It would end up with
a sine of 2x.

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,900
So whatever's here,
I want here.

59
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,780
Plus B, some undetermined
coefficient times cosine of x.

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,290
And once again, this
was sine of 2x.

61
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,740
I'd want a cosine of 2x here.

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,030
So let's figure out its first
and second derivitives.

63
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:05,756
So the first derivative of this
y prime is equal to A

64
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:08,680
cosine of x.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,170
Cosine derivative is minus sine,
so minus B sine of x.

66
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,510
And then the second
derivitive--

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,930
I'll write down here.

68
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,960
The second derivative
is equal to what?

69
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,640
Derivative of cosine is minus
sine, so minus A sine of x

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,510
minus B cosine of x.

71
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,330
   

72
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,420
I think you're starting to see
that the hardest thing in most

73
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,270
differential equations problems
is not making

74
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,040
careless mistakes.

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,480
It's a lot of algebra and a lot
of fairly basic calculus.

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,250
And the real trick is to not
make careless mistakes.

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,930
Every time I say that,
I tend to make one.

78
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,240
So I'm going to focus
extra right now.

79
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,930
So anyway, let's take these and
substitute them back into

80
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,110
this nonhomogeneous equation.

81
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,820
Let's see if I can solve
for A and B.

82
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,033
So the second derivative
is that.

83
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,560
   

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,310
Let me just rewrite it,
just so that you

85
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,450
see what I'm doing.

86
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,866
So I'm going to take the second
derivative, y prime

87
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:17,690
prime, so that's minus A sine
of x minus B cosine of x.

88
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,360
I'm going to add minus 3 times
the first derivative to that.

89
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,960
And I'm going to write the sines
under the sines and the

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,090
cosines under the consines.

91
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,390
So minus 3 times this.

92
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,640
So the sine is, let's see.

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:39,370
It's plus 3B sine of x
minus 3 times this.

94
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:49,190
So minus 3A cosine of x.

95
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,160
And then minus 4 times our
original function.

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,650
So minus 4A sine of x.

97
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,050
Right?

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,250
Minus 4 times that.

99
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,270
Minus 4 times this.

100
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,332
Minus 4B cosine of x.

101
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:15,585
And when I take the sum of all
of those-- that's essentially

102
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,920
the left-hand side to this
equation-- when I take the sum

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,870
of all of that, that is
equal to 2 sine of x.

104
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,740
I could have written them out
in a line, but it would have

105
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,215
just been more confusing.

106
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:28,840
And now this makes it easy to
add up the sine of x's and the

107
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,540
cosine of x's.

108
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,960
So if I add up all the
coefficients on the sine of x,

109
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,980
I get minus A plus
3B minus 4A.

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:46,290
So that looks like minus 5A plus
3B sine of x plus-- and

111
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,620
now what are the coefficients
here?

112
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,150
   

113
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,380
I have minus B and then I have
another minus 4B, so minus 5B

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,760
and then minus 3A.

115
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:05,890
So minus 3A minus
5B cosine of x.

116
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,520
The cosine of x should
go right here.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,970
So anyway, how do I
solve for A and B?

118
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,710
Well, I have the minus 5A
3B is equal to whatever

119
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,430
coefficients in front
of sine of x here.

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,090
So minus 5A plus 3B must
be equal to 2.

121
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,610
And then minus 3A minus 5B is
the coefficient on cosine of

122
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,320
x, although I kind of
squeezed in the

123
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
cosine of x here, right?

124
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,040
So this must be equal to
whatever the coefficient on

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,320
cosine of x is on the
right-hand side.

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,160
Well the coefficient of
cosine of x on the

127
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,940
right-hand side is 0.

128
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,480
So that sets up a system of two

129
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,840
unknowns with two equations.

130
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,500
A linear system.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:57,720
So we get minus 5A plus
3B is equal to 2.

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:07,326
And we get minus 3A minus
5B is equal to 0.

133
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,680
   

134
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,170
And let's see if I can simplify
this a little bit.

135
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:14,790
Let's see.

136
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,920
This is a system of two
unknowns, two equations.

137
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:23,530
If I multiply the top equation
by 5 1/3s, right?

138
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,410
Actually, let me multiply the
top equation by 5 1/3s.

139
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:41,630
I get minus 25/3 A plus 5B is
equal to 5 1/3s times this.

140
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,670
5 1/3s times 2 is 10 1/3s.

141
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,990
And the bottom equation
is minus 3A minus

142
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,320
5B is equal to 0.

143
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,310
Let's add the two equations.

144
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,250
I get 10 1/3s is equal to--
these cancel out.

145
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:17,570
That's minus 25/3 minus 9/3
A is equal to 10 1/3s.

146
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,260
This is getting a little bit
messier than I like, but we'll

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,000
soldier on.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,230
So minus 25 minus 9.

149
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,960
What's minus 25 minus 9?

150
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,120
So that is 34.

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:41,600
So we get 34 over 3A
is equal to 10/3.

152
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,059
We can multiply both
sides by 3.

153
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,770
Divide both sides by 34.

154
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,360
A is equal to 10/34, which
is equal to 5/17.

155
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,830
Nice ugly number.

156
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,000
5/17 and now we can
solve for B.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,340
So let's see.

158
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,800
Minus 3 times A minus
3 times A.

159
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,530
5/17 minus 5B is equal to 0.

160
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,430
So that's what?

161
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:21,130
Minus 15/17 is equal
to plus 5B.

162
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,270
I just took this and put it
on the right-hand side.

163
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,430
And then divide both
sides by 5.

164
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,180
   

165
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:31,990
Oh, you know what?

166
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,330
I realized I made a careless
mistake here.

167
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,990
Minus 25 minus 9.

168
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,160
That's the minus 34 over 3.

169
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,530
so minus 34A is equal to 10.

170
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:45,510
A is equal to minus 10/34
or minus 5/17.

171
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,310
So minus 3 times minus 5/17.

172
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,980
So 5/17 is equal to
plus 5B, right?

173
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,050
And then we get B is
equal to 3/17.

174
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,050
That was hairy.

175
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,870
And notice, the hard
part was not losing

176
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,100
your negative sines.

177
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,710
But anyway, we now have our
particular solution to this.

178
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,030
   

179
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,140
let me try to write in a
non-nauseating color, although

180
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,150
I think I picked a
nauseating one.

181
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:27,480
The particular solution is A
minus 5/17 sine of x-- right?

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,160
That was a coefficient on sine
of x-- plus B plus 3/17 times

183
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,240
cosine of x.

184
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,300
And if we look at our original
problem, the general solution

185
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,310
out of this nonhomogeneous
equation would be this-- which

186
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,010
is the general solution to the
homogeneous equation, which

187
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,950
we've done many videos on--
plus now our particular

188
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,690
solution that we solved using
the method of undetermined

189
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,330
coefficient.

190
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,420
So if you just take that and add
it to that, you're done.

191
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,850
And I am out of time.

192
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,070
See you in the next video.
