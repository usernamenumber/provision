1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:02,945
In the first video in future's fair value

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:04,783
we learned that it was the price

3
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:07,261
at which an investor would be neutral

4
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,713
between buying the stock

5
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:10,618
on the actual stock market

6
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:13,461
or buying the front month future's contract

7
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:14,693
What I want to to in this video

8
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:17,675
is talk about how does one interpret the fair value

9
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,786
especially relative to the future's price

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,321
So lets say you wake up one morning

11
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,643
the market hasn't opened yet

12
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:24,252
the stock market hasn't opened

13
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:27,624
and you see a quote like this for stock ABCD

14
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:28,962
The fair value according to

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,823
the closing of yesterday's trading

16
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,909
the fair value is $102

17
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,310
but the future's market which trades

18
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,610
usually as the trading hours

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,996
beyond the regular market

20
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:41,992
and often times 24 hours

21
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:43,830
So the future's market trading price

22
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,197
for the front month future

23
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:46,403
even though the fair value

24
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,737
based on yesterday's closing is $102

25
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:52,273
The future's market is trading at $101

26
00:00:52,273 --> 00:00:53,948
So how would you use that information

27
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:56,370
or how would one interpret that information

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,584
So the future's market

29
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:00,403
people are trading the futures contract

30
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:01,947
They are buying and selling

31
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,305
at price below the fair value

32
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,672
based on yesterday's close price

33
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:08,100
So what that means is

34
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,748
that the market thinks that

35
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:11,380
this is actually no longer

36
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,224
the correct price of the stock

37
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,394
They think that the correct price of the stock

38
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:17,319
is the stock at which they would be neutral

39
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,516
between that price and this future's contract

40
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:21,514
So I don't know what it is

41
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,646
you'd have to discount it back

42
00:01:22,646 --> 00:01:23,772
by the risk-free rate

43
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:24,985
but maybe its something like

44
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,454
So this is implicitly saying

45
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,470
that the correct price of the stock isn't $100

46
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,702
if the future's price was $102

47
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:33,541
it would say that the stock should be $100

48
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,341
If the future's price is $101

49
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,312
then it means that maybe

50
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:38,048
the stock is something less than that

51
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,348
Maybe if we do our math

52
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:48,918
maybe it implies a stock price of $99.

53
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,365
So the way you would potentially act on it.

54
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,141
although it's easlier said than done

55
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,564
is say well look that means that

56
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:57,562
at least in the very early stages once the market opens

57
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:59,642
the stock is going to go down

58
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:01,511
Now you initial reaction might be saying

59
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,714
Wow, this is really amazing

60
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,224
this is some type of future indicator

61
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,042
and it is pretty strong future indicator

62
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,126
when you see this

63
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,110
when you see the actual price of the future

64
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,538
being below the fair value

65
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,958
It is very likely that the stock will open down

66
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,185
Unfortunately, you have many many

67
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:19,596
very sophisticated high frequency traders

68
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:21,462
who already have their computers set up

69
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,656
to look at this type of discrepency

70
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,407
and they are going to be ultra fast

71
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:26,428
and they are optimizing

72
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,830
how fast their bandwidth is

73
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,845
so they can do these

74
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:30,220
in a matter of split seconds

75
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,731
So it is very, very unlikely

76
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,267
that a average investor

77
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,697
or even a reasonably sophisticated investor

78
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:39,193
will be able to take advantage

79
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,735
of this type of arbitrage

80
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,568
or this type of an expected arbitrage

81
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:45,733
to know this price is likely to go down

82
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,450
Now, if the opposite happened

83
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,244
let's say that the fair value is $102

84
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:52,699
which implies that the fair value

85
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,257
of the front month future's contract is $102

86
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:58,274
which implies $100 stock price

87
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:00,962
Let's say that the future's

88
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:01,965
is actually trading

89
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:04,622
even though the fair value is $102

90
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:09,597
Let's say it's trading at $105

91
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,132
So, this is a situation that

92
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:12,734
since the market closed

93
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,751
the future's market for some reason thinks

94
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:16,350
that the stock is going to be worth more

95
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,880
This would imply a stock price

96
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,774
of, maybe, I don't know what it might be

97
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:21,223
I'm not going to do the math exactly

98
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:24,801
but maybe a price of $103 or $104

99
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,839
And so if you saw this

100
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,498
where the future's price is above the fair value

101
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:29,713
in the pre-market

102
00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:32,081
that means that the stock is likely to go up

103
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,679
But once again, its very hard

104
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,438
to take advantage of

105
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:35,541
because you're going to see that movement

106
00:03:35,541 --> 99:59:59,999
very, very, very quickly.
