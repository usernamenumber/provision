1
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,954
In the middle of the seventeenth century

2
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,676
Rome was reborn.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,668
It was a tremendous building camapign

4
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:13,719
and I think about the extravagance spaces

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,502
of the church of il Gesu

6
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:18,167
with its extraordinary illusionistic ceiling.

7
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,683
this was operatic, it was theatrical.

8
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:22,088
It's hard to imagine how

9
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,573
at a very same time

10
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:25,942
there we have that broke theatricality

11
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:30,265
we have the classicism, the repose, the peacefulness

12
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:33,190
the rationalism of Poussin.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,521
We're in the Art Institute of Chicago.

14
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,772
We're looking at Possin's landscape with Sant John on Patmos.

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,104
This is a painting that really is about

16
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:44,168
classical order and measured reality.

17
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:47,389
We know this is Saint John because of the eagle that stands beside him,

18
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:50,328
which is a traditional symbol of this Evangelist.

19
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,738
We're looking at Saint John

20
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,655
sitting in the foreground writing the book of Revelation,

21
00:00:56,655 --> 00:01:00,956
writing about the end of time, the second comming of Christ

22
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:03,510
are really violent moments,

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,391
but within this incredibly serene and peaceful landscape.

24
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:09,841
And of course it's Pussain who has been credited

25
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,507
with inventing the ideal landscape and

26
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:14,371
that's exactly what we have here.

27
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,203
And it's going to be very important for art history,

28
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,756
for actually centuries to come.

29
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:21,188
Artists will look back at the classical landscape

30
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:22,952
and reinterprete it.

31
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:25,422
In fact Pussin style was so infuential

32
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:28,104
that it became a standard for the French Academy.

33
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:30,706
And those who painted landscapes in this way,

34
00:01:30,706 --> 00:01:33,474
with a sense of rigor and order and rationalism,

35
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:35,007
in a kind of ideal landscape,

36
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:36,973
became known as poussinists.

37
00:01:36,973 --> 00:01:38,573
So what has he actually done here?

38
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:42,406
He's placed the main figure in the foreground but he's really quite small

39
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:47,188
in relationship to the landscape. He sits in a very classicised pose.

40
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:50,816
In fact we think that Poussin took this pose directly

41
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:54,355
from representations of river gods from ancient Rome.

42
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:56,389
And of course Poussin, although he was French,

43
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:58,617
was in Rome for most of his life.

44
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:02,387
And that figure, Saint John, is enromanited in the foreground.

45
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:05,617
He's surrounded by the ruines of classical antiquity.

46
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:09,158
We see ruines to his left and to his right.

47
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,592
And also in the background, where we see the ruins

48
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:14,449
of a classical temple and an ancient obelisk.

49
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,534
So he's in this landscape that has a sense of the passage of time

50
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:21,989
as he's writing his book about the end of time.

51
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,524
The notion of passage, I think, is important to understanding

52
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:27,570
the way Pussin constructs a landscape.

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,900
Saint John is placed in the very foreground,

54
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,440
right at the bottom of the painting,

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,024
but we can't raise back to the middle ground

56
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,955
where that temple is that you had mentioned.

57
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,350
Instead, we have a couple of visual paths.

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,155
We may try to go down and straight back, but

59
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:43,856
we see water, not once but twice.

60
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:45,538
And also a curtain of trees.

61
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,618
And so that way seems too difficult. So instead,

62
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,886
our eye meanders over to the right

63
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,854
and we see a road that seems to go back,

64
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:56,188
but it draws our eyes slowly through this landscape

65
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:57,571
so that we slow down

66
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,707
and enjoy the space that he's created.

67
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,387
And at each point in this landscape

68
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:03,504
he gives us something to look at, the foreground

69
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,272
with Saint John and the ruins, that path way

70
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:10,701
punctuated by trees, into the middle ground

71
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:15,622
with that temple and obelisk and then again into the background

72
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:19,623
with the mountains and furter back with the area perspective and

73
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:22,437
more mountains and clouds. At each place

74
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:26,089
our eye has a place to rest in the landscape.

75
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,072
The lanscape is not a specific place.

76
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:32,149
This is very much a collage of ideal forms and it makes sens

77
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,205
for an artist whose aesthetic has been shaped by Rome,

78
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,973
which itself is layers of cultures.

79
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:39,425
Look for instance at this painting where

80
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,572
you've got the classical Greek or Roman temple

81
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,806
but it's next to an Egyptian obelisk.

82
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,320
We actually see references to two cultures,

83
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,049
both of which had ruled but had both fallen.

84
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,024
The idea here by showing those ruins is to show that

85
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,357
there is a new Christian order that will be eternal,

86
00:03:56,357 --> 00:03:59,465
foretold by Saint John's book of Revelation.

87
00:03:59,465 --> 00:04:02,437
The landscape is carefully, rigorously composed.

88
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:06,159
Everything has a sens of order and structure and geometry.

89
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,004
But that is so counter to what we expect or

90
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:12,088
what we think about Saint John writing the Apocalypse.

91
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:15,710
This is a widely violent vision, it is the end of time.

92
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,007
It's an important reminder that this artist was

93
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,603
actually studying stoic philosophy from ancient Greece,

94
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:26,393
this idea that the control of emotion was of the utmost importance.

95
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:30,156
And not just Poussin but the circle of painters that he found in Rome.

96
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:33,387
We need to remember that there was more going on in Rome.

97
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:36,320
Then the pope's commisioning these theatrical works of art

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,810
in the churchers of counterreformation.

99
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,404
Poussin found a circle of painters, many of whom were

100
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:47,619
interested in stoic philosophy, and that he painted canvases like this one.

101
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,742
So Poussin has accomplished what seems to be nearly impossible.

102
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:56,742
He's created poetry out of the rational, out of the ideal.
