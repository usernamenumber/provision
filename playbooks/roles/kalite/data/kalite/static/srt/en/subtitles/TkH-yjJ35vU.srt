1
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:05,679
We are in the Louvre and we are looking at

2
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,175
Caravaggio's painting "The Death of the Virgin"

3
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:10,640
from 1605-1606, and this is a very large painting .

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,200
And it is quite dark.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,405
Caravaggio is known for painting in the dark manner

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:18,947
but this is an especially dark painting and it actually might need to be cleaned.

7
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:22,300
Maybe, we see that dark tenebrous background

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,610
and the figure is very, very close to us

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,909
but we don't see anything that we might expect to see

10
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,111
in a painting of "The Virgin Mary's Death".

11
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,745
Normally we may expect to see her being sent to heaven

12
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:36,100
or angels receiving her in heaven and typicall of Caravaggio

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,675
is created a spiritual scene but totally down-to-earth

14
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:43,132
and use a very everyday language depicted.

15
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:46,360
The Virgin Mary herself looks like she could be a contemporary Roman.

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,949
She doesn't look particularly spiritual

17
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,370
aside from the faint halo

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,656
which we can barely make out around her head.

19
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:58,053
Her hair is undone, the front of her dress is coming up,

20
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:01,340
her feet are bare which was really indecent.

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,963
The priest of her times said that she looked like

22
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,437
Caravaggio had modeled her on a prostitute that had been dragged down from the river.

23
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:11,468
Hardly inappropriate model for the Virgin Mary.

24
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:14,733
In fact the Monks had rejected the painting because of that rumour.

25
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,585
So the painting is down-to-earth

26
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,205
and it is in a sense the Catholic's story brought

27
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:22,324
into our world in a most direct way,

28
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,540
and when you look at the scale of the painting

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,211
and the way that this young woman is mourning in the foreground,

30
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:30,184
bends down, she seems to virtually be in our space.

31
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:34,094
We can reach over to that copper basin that is just at her feet

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,792
and seems to be just at ours as well.

33
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,717
I think Caravaggio really intentionally

34
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:41,310
left the space open for us

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,568
in the circle of mourners who surround her.

36
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:47,089
If you look at them they are obviously the apostles.

37
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:50,097
But Caravaggio has let the light fallen

38
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:51,791
perhaps in the most unflattering aspects of their features

39
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:55,455
and the way that I think is typical of Caravaggio

40
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:59,515
and his interest in the everyday and the common and the lowly

41
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,462
But it is not to say that he is not a master of the composition.

42
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:06,509
If you look on that wonderful swash of red cloth above,

43
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,218
the way it frames beautifully and elegantly the scene,

44
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:13,238
but it also creates a kind of arcing curve that is repeated in those bold heads

45
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:16,949
which actually also sort of reverse and lead us down to the Virgin Mary.

46
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:20,987
Her body lies across a diagonal or mind that they were no longer in the Renaissance.

47
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:26,688
We are looking at the more activated composition that is very much typical of the baroque.

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,961
Her arm creates a different kind of diagonal as it moves towards us

49
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:33,048
and it has this incredible broken wrist

50
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,163
which then leads us down to the woman below her.

51
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:38,116
I think it is almost as if Caravaggio is suggesting

52
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,460
that we should be like this young woman before us

53
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,222
bend over in sorrow for the death of the Virgin.

54
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:47,649
I was noticing the hands, the hands of the apostle in gold

55
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:50,414
that hand blesses for sure. It's wonderful isn't it?

56
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:53,320
The figure below him has got head in his hands.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,776
The figure next to the man in gold is weeping, is rubbing his eyes

58
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:01,853
The other figure next to him with his head up in his hands

59
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:04,695
and then down to the Virgin Mary

60
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:06,945
whose arm is for sure hand hang down but the other hand,

61
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:10,859
the right hand looks as if it was sort of flocked down on her chest.

62
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,915
If you sit we can really sense that this is indeed a dead body.

63
00:03:15,915 --> 00:03:20,301
There is no sense of spiritual rebirth or salvation.

64
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,391
We almost feel rigour setting in here.

65
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:26,243
Look at the way that her right hand, the ring finger

66
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:29,104
is tucked under the middle finger in a kind of

67
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:31,802
passive way that no living person would allow to happen.

68
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:34,168
It is that Caravaggio was completetly rejecting

69
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,368
the elegance of the high Renaissance

70
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:40,500
to intentionally give us something difficult and almost ugly.

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,626
It's something that is off our world,

72
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:46,919
this embrace of the spiritual through our world.
