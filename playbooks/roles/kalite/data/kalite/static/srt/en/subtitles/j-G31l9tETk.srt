1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,360
All right, we left
off at number 11.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,740
This is a pretty straightforward
triangle.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,330
So I can draw it in my messy
style, without the line tool.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,180
   

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,530
We have A, B, C.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,020
This is 3, 4, and 6.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,990
Each angle of triangle ABC has
the same measure as an angle

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,650
in triangle XYZ, which
has not been shown.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,060
Well, we should draw
that, though.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,290
It has the same angle.

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:42,040
I have a feeling that this is
a similar triangle X, Y, Z.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,470
XYZ.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,420
If the length of one side of
XYZ is 24-- so we just know

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,820
some random side here is 24.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,970
it could be this one.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,230
Maybe, I don't know.

18
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,780
If the length of one side is
24, what is the possible

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,420
perimeter of XYZ?

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,950
What is one possible
perimeter?

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,580
This probably has three correct
answers, which is fun,

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,790
because in some ways, increases
your probability of

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,080
getting this right.

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,030
But when you know that two
triangles have all the same

25
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,450
angles, you immediately know
that it is a similar triangle.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,280
Which means that they look the
same, they're just of a

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,070
different scale.

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,890
And you should watch the similar
triangle video that I

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,840
made in the geometry
play list, if this

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,150
makes no sense to you.

31
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,370
Because this will make no sense
if you haven't heard the

32
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,480
term before.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,630
But, since these are similar
triangles, the ratios of the

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,820
corresponding sides are
going to be the same.

35
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,380
They're letting us pick which
side has a length of 24.

36
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,630
So let's say that the side that
corresponds to side 3 is

37
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,480
of length of 24, right?

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,340
We don't know that this is
definitely the case, but

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,430
they're letting us pick.

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,170
So I'm going to say that
X Y corresponds to A B.

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,400
So if this side is 24, then this
side is going to be 4/3

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,440
of this side, right?

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,050
Hopefully, you remember similar
triangles, that the

44
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,070
ratios of the sides
are the same.

45
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:13,570
So if 3 is to 4, as 24 is to--
Well, to go from 3 to 24, we

46
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,610
multiply by 8.

47
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,920
So to go from 4 to this,
we multiply by 8.

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,380
So 32.

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,470
And to go from 6 to this,
we multiply by 8.

50
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,440
48.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,070
So this is a possible
combination of sides for a

52
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,850
similar triangle to
triangle ABC.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,720
And we can just add these up.

54
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,970
So 24 plus 32 is 56.

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,160
Plus 48.

56
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,480
6 plus 8 is 14.

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,230
104.

58
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,950
Just bubble type that in, 104.

59
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,180
This could have been 24.

60
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,440
If this is 24, that means
we're multiplying

61
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,030
by 6 to get to 24.

62
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,850
So this would be 18.

63
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,030
This would be 36.

64
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,540
You could add all of
those up together.

65
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,940
And you would have gotten
another answer.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,760
And that would have
been correct.

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,350
And similarly, you could
have made this side 24.

68
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,440
If this side was 24, then that
means we're multiplying

69
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,980
every side by 4.

70
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,130
So this would have been 12, and
this would have been 16.

71
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,950
And you could have
added those up.

72
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,000
And that would have been the
other, the third possible,

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,050
correct answer for
this problem.

74
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,750
Exciting.

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's move on.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,630
   

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,830
The sum of five consecutive
integers is a thousand.

78
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,780
Number 12.

79
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,680
If five consecutive integers
is a thousand, what is the

80
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,350
value of the greatest
of these integers?

81
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,220
So they're consecutive
integers.

82
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,140
So there are five of them.

83
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,830
So we want to know the greatest
of these integers.

84
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,180
So let's say x is the greatest.
And so the second

85
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,960
greatest is going
to be x minus 1.

86
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,760
The third greatest
is x minus 2.

87
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,540
The fourth greatest
is x minus 3.

88
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,960
And then the fifth greatest
is x minus 4, right?

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,340
These are five integers and
they're consecutive.

90
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,080
And this is the largest,
right?

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
And we're going to take
the sum of them.

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,970
   

93
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,670
This is a tip.

94
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,120
If they were asking for the
smallest number, I would have

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,370
started with x.

96
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,313
And I would have gone, x
plus one, x plus 2, x

97
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:21,209
plus 3, like that.

98
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,075
Because then x would have
been my smallest number.

99
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,200
But they said x is the largest.
We want to solve for

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,790
x, so the greatest of
these integers.

101
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,770
So that's why I subtracted.

102
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,390
If we add all these
up, we have 5 x's.

103
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,650
So that's 5x minus 1
minus 2 is minus 3.

104
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,990
Minus 3 is minus 6.

105
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,800
Minus 4 is minus 10.

106
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,130
5x minus 10.

107
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,450
They say that the
sum is 1,000.

108
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,390
And this is a fairly simple
algebra equation.

109
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,040
5x is equal to-- add
10 to both sides.

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,880
1,010, which is also 10 in
binary, if you are a geek.

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:08,840
Divide both sides by 5. x
is equal to 205, right?

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,770
No, I can't divide by 5.

113
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
202, right?

114
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,590
x is equal to 202.

115
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,860
There you go.

116
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,070
Not too bad.

117
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,120
All right.

118
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,610
Number 13.

119
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,200
And I'm going to switch colors,
because pale yellow is

120
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,990
getting monotonous.

121
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,420
I'll switch to something
bold like blood red.

122
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,810
No, that's tacky.

123
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,430
Number 13.

124
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,530
The figure above shows
y equals g of x.

125
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,880
   

126
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,470
So let me draw that, because I
don't want to confuse you just

127
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,100
saying a lot of random crap.

128
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,350
You see what the graph looks
like, although you should have

129
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,870
it turned to the same page.

130
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,310
OK.

131
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,560
I draw it like that.

132
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,130
   

133
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,360
No, I don't have to draw
that far down.

134
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,130
Like that.

135
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,000
And it looks something
like this.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,412
Let me draw it in a
different color.

137
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,300
The line itself-- something
goes from here,

138
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,550
goes up like this.

139
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,240
   

140
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,050
Then, it kind of comes
back down like here.

141
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,640
Then it kind of bounces.

142
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,400
It goes back up like this.

143
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,440
And then they tell us that this
line, right here, is y is

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,000
equal to g of x.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,130
It's going to be a functions
problem.

146
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,810
I can tell you already.

147
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,840
So you should watch the function
videos or do the

148
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,410
function modules on
Khan Academy.

149
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,560
So the figure above shows the
graph y equals g of x.

150
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:53,880
If the function h is defined by,
h of x is equal to g of 2x

151
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,840
plus 2, they want to know
what h of 1 is equal to.

152
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,110
Well, with functions,
they're putting a 1

153
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,000
into this black box.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,920
So wherever we see the x,
we put a 1 in, right?

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:15,350
So h of 1 is equal to-- let's
just use this definition-- g

156
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,830
of 2 times x.

157
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,830
Well, in this case, x is 1.
g of 2 times 1 plus 2.

158
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,900
So that equals g of 3 plus 2.

159
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,510
Now, we have to figure
out what g of 3 is.

160
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,240
And if you look at this graph--
and in the book it's

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,700
more obvious.

162
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,100
There's 1, 2, and then it hits
0 right at 3, right?

163
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,050
So g of 3, when x is equal to
3, g of 3 is right here.

164
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,660
That's 0.

165
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,910
g of 3 is 0.

166
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,740
   

167
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,700
We're just left with a 2.

168
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,040
h of 1 is 2.

169
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,810
That's all.

170
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,960
Amazing.

171
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,210
All right, next problem.

172
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,380
   

173
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,420
Number 14.

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:19,700
Exactly 4 actors try out
for 4 parts in a play.

175
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,070
If each actor can perform any
1 part, and no one will

176
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,380
perform more than 1 part, how
many different assignments of

177
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,640
actors are possible?

178
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,059
Well, let's just say you're just
randomly doing it, right?

179
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,590
So let's put up the actors.

180
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,440
   

181
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,710
You take the first guy, right?

182
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,720
And you say, well, I
can put him in any

183
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,150
1 of 4 roles, right?

184
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,940
For the first guy, I could
put him in any

185
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,700
1 of 4 roles, right?

186
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,936
And then the second guy-- I
shouldn't assume they're all

187
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:54,180
men-- and the second actor,
or woman, or actress.

188
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,080
1 role has been taken
already, right?

189
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,030
There were 4 roles.

190
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,370
This first person took it.

191
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,000
So now, there's only 3
roles left, right?

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
There's 3 possibilities.

193
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,380
There's 1 of 3 possibilities
for that

194
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,530
second person, correct?

195
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,700
OK, so the third person-- how
many possibilities does he or

196
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,770
she have left?

197
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,470
Well, 2 of the roles have
been taken already.

198
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,870
So there's only 2 possibilities
for that person.

199
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,400
And then the last person
to be picked has only

200
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,210
1 role left, right?

201
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,240
So the combinations are
literally just 4 times 3

202
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
times 2 times 1.

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
So that's 12 times 2.

204
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,810
That's 24 combinations or
assignments of roles.

205
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,415
And I actually haven't made a
probability, and combinations,

206
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,060
and permutations video yet.

207
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,420
I will.

208
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,460
And once I do, watch that
if this problem seemed

209
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,530
confusing to you.

210
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,130
But hopefully, it makes a little
bit of intuitive sense.

211
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,690
I'll see you in the
next video.
