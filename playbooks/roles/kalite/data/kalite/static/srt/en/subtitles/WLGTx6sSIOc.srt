Last video, we saw how to draw dot structure of molecule with single covalent bonds.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this video will talk about multiple covalent bonds.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we start in the same way with the last video

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i want to draw the dot structure for C2H4

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i would find carbon over here

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and once again carbon is in Group 4,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it has 4 valence electrons.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so i'm going to go ahead and put in one carbon with four valence electrons

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and i know i have another carbon in my dot structure.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it also has four vlence electrons like that

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so immediately i can see there is going to see a single covalent bond between my two carbons like that

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for hydrogens, and i know that

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hydrogens is in Group 1 on our periodic table,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hydrogen hass one valence electron.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now it makes sense and go ahead and put two hydrogens on each carbon

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if i put one hydrogen over here

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then another hydrogen on this carbon

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i have two more hydrogens

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so i can go ahead and put two hydrogens in the carbon on the right

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when i connect my dots, i can see that i have a bond between carbon and the hydrogen here.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is not the correct dot structure.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because if you count of the number of electrons around the carbons,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's go ahead and do it.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's do the carbon on the left

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm going to get two, four, six and seven electrons

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it only has seven electrons around each carbon

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
carbon does not satisfythe octet rule

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the only way for the carbon to get the octet of the electrons around it,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it would be this magenta electron moved in here

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this electron mobves in here

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to form a double-covalent code
