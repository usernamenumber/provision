1
00:00:06,193 --> 00:00:08,127
A: We are here at the Metropolitan Meseum of Art,

2
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:12,109
A: in New York, looking at a monumental sculpture of a Bodhisattva.

3
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:18,809
B: So, the Buddha's the main figure we often see, and there are many Buddha's in Chinese Buddhist art.

4
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,533
There is the historical Buddha, but lots of other figures.

5
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:28,350
And there are also Bodhisattva's, and that's what we're looking at, and one of the main ways you can distinguish

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,166
them is that the Bodhisatta's are often heavily adorned, like this figure is.

7
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:43,833
A Bodhisattva is an enlightened being that has chosen not to pursue Nirvana, but remain with ties to the earthly realm,

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:48,032
and secure enlightenment, or release of Samsara,

9
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:50,532
which is the cycle of rebirth for all sentient beings.

10
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:54,217
So, Bodhisattva's are seen as beings of compassion.

11
00:00:54,217 --> 00:01:03,007
B: So, they've decided to forego Nirvana, and be here for us, for regular people. To help us achieve our own Nirvana.

12
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:07,356
A: And they're shown to have these worldly ties through their princely garb.

13
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:16,372
The iconography of a Buddha is shown in monk's garb, having relinquished all ties to the earth, all ties to material things.

14
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:20,472
So, you see the Buddha with the elongated earlobes and the jewels removed.

15
00:01:20,472 --> 00:01:26,523
Here we see a Bodhisattva in princely robes, and heavily adorned with

16
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:30,289
valuable jewels, showing their connections still to the earth.

17
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:37,307
B: What's funny is that is the Bodhisattva of compassion, and yet I don't feel a lot of identification with it.

18
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:46,678
It's very frontal, it's very symmetrical, and severe, and kind of abstracted. And it feels very distant in that way.

19
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:52,715
A: There is a solemnness, a serenity, but there is also a haughtiness to the expression of this image.

20
00:01:52,715 --> 00:02:00,730
B: Exactly, he must be about fifteen or twenty feet high, and I imagine it stood in the temple complex.

21
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:07,214
A: Yes; it's huge, and frontal, so perhaps it was the main image for worship in its location.

22
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:11,249
B: And often these kinds of figures would be shown as groups within a temple.

23
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:15,414
And this one was so large that it's likely that it is the main figure.

24
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:21,731
A: Often, Bodhisattva's are show flanking Buddha's, and they'll have the weight on one foot, turning toward

25
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:28,532
the Buddha that they're flanking. And this image is presented frontally, and often this Bodhisattva is

26
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:35,031
attributed to being Avalokitesvara -Guanyin- the Bodhisattva of compassion, the most popular

27
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:39,647
Bodhisattva for worship in China, under Mahayana-type of Buddhism.

28
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:46,097
B: One of the ways we would normally identify a Bodhisattva figure, since there are many Bodhisattva's, representing

29
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:53,447
different ideas, is by what they're holding, but unfortunately, this sculpture, being from the Sixth Century,

30
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:58,960
has suffered a lot of damage, and its hands are no longer with it, and so, we don't know what it held.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,160
A: Right, we don't know what the attributes may have been, and Avalokitesvara -Guanyin- in China, often has the

32
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,926
Buddha, Amitabha, in the crown. And that's an attribute that distinguishes it, and makes it clear that the

33
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:21,209
iconography is Avalokitesvara, but here the Buddha is not there. It's more of a floral crown, so there is some

34
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,670
A: uncertainty over which Bodhisattva this actually is.

35
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,601
B: It's interesting how much we can tell about it, but how much of it is really in dispute by scholars.

36
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:39,902
And the styles of art that we see in Art History are so connected to the historical circumstances. Often politics, the government.

37
00:03:39,902 --> 00:03:46,468
And we know that the period just before this was called the Northern Wei, which had a really different style.

38
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:53,651
A: Yes, what happens is in the Northern Wei, the styles that was predominant was weightless and very linear.

39
00:03:53,651 --> 00:04:00,985
Important examples can be found in the cave temple of Yungang, where in Cave 6 you would see a Buddha,

40
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:06,651
or Bodhisattva image that shows no attention to the body form, but a lot attention to the fold and lines

41
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:10,119
of the drapery, and the shapes are weightless.

42
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:18,918
B: So that period known as the Northern Wei is about fifty years before this, and is a relatively stable time in parts of China -

43
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,968
A: Particularly in the North, absolutely.

44
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:24,901
B: - and then a period of political upheaval follows.

45
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:31,535
A: And the two strong dynasties that emerge in the North are the Northern Qi, in the East, and the Northern Chou,

46
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:37,747
in the West. And this is a very interesting Bodhisattva example, when you're thinking about that time period.

47
00:04:37,747 --> 00:04:43,432
There are some characteristics that really indicate the Northern Qi, but others that indicate the Northern Chou.

48
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:49,659
And, granted, there's a lot of overlap in between the styles of Buddha's and Bodhisattva's that come out of the two

49
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:56,852
dynasties. One thing is this incredible opulence in terms of the drapery and the jewelry, details that are

50
00:04:56,852 --> 00:05:03,986
often associated with the Northern Chou. The other aspect that is Northern Chou is the square shape to the face,

51
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:11,318
the block-like features. Both the Nothern Chou and the Northern Qi broke in from this Northern Wei aesthetic of

52
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:18,025
weightlessness, and show the Bodhisattva's and Buddha's with a lot of three-dimensional and geometric forms.

53
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,837
B: This figure is anything but weightless.

54
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:26,207
A: Absolutely. And you can see its monumental and columnar, but it has this weight and volume.

55
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,190
We are looking at it the way that it would've been viewed in the temple.

56
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,621
We would be looking up at it, which is why the head is so oversized.

57
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,488
B: So, the artist would've wanted to make sure that we could really see the head

58
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:36,990
A: Yes.

59
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,124
B: And from far below, one way to do that is to enlarge the head.

60
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:48,573
A: And looking at the facial features, in particular, there is a head at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that is from Xiangtangshan,

61
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:55,489
a Northern Qi site in China. And if you compare this head, you can see that this is much more block-like, but when you

62
00:05:55,489 --> 00:06:00,407
look at the lips, and the eyes and the other aspects of the facial features, there is a similarity.

63
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:09,593
B: So, we're really talking about dynasties, different historical periods, and different regional styles emerging in different places.

64
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:14,976
And art historians really needing to study each of those places, and the art that emerges,

65
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:20,063
and then comparing and contrasting to locate a lot of these early figures.

66
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:25,125
Buddhism had only come to China had only come to China a few years earlier, from India.

67
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:34,427
And, in those few hundred years, the styles that developed from Buddhist art are really dependent on those different regions, and different dynasties.

68
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,577
And therefore, there's so much change going on.

69
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:41,493
A: And this is an interesting example of that because we see here this very abrupt break

70
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:46,176
with the weightless, linear aesthetic of the Northern Wei, to this much more volumetric,

71
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:51,241
massive forms that is associated with the Northern Qi and Northern Chou.

72
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:56,644
This source for this change is often identified as Gupta in India. Sensuous Gupta style.

73
00:06:56,644 --> 00:07:00,209
B: It's really a puzzle (A: It is) in many ways. So many questions.

74
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:05,302
One thing we know for sure, because we can see the residue here, is that the sculpture was painted,

75
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:09,919
and probably painted many times to keep the color vibrant over the years.

76
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,521
A: What we're really looking at is probably remnants of Ming dynasty painting,

77
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,591
maybe Sixteen Century. But it would've been an originally painted as well.

78
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:25,168
B: So, its important to imagine in its original context, within a temple, sensuously painted

79
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,485
and in that kind of religious, spiritual context.

80
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:34,318
A: Yes, and a much darker environment as well, and surrounded by other sculptures and paintings.

81
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,735
