99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's try to come up with a mathematically rigorous definition for what this statement means.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The statement that f(x) as x approaches c is equal to L

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say that this means that you can get

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can get f(x)

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as close to L as you want

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll put that in quotes right over here...

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but as close as you want

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by getting x sufficiently close

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to c, so another way of saying this is if you tell me

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"hey I want to get my f(x) to be within 0.5 of this limit", then you're telling me if this

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
limit is actually true, then you should be able to hand me a value around

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
c that if x is within that range, that f(x) is definitely going to be as close to L as I desire.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me draw that out to make it a little bit clearer and I'm gonna zoom in

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll draw another diagram. So let's say that...

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is my y-axis and I'm gonna zoom in

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll draw a slightly different function just so that we can

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
focus on what's going on around here, the range

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is around c and the range is around L

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's x

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here is y

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is c, and let's just say

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our function is doing something like

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
doing something like --let's see I don't want it to be defined

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at c, at least just for the--. It could be, you could always find the limit even

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when it's undefined. But let's just say our function looks something like that.
