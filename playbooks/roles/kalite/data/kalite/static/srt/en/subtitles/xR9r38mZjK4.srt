1
00:00:00,273 --> 00:00:07,464
what i want to do with this video is think about the relationship between variables and then think about what the graph of that relationship should look like.

2
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:13,212
So let's say these two axis, the horizontal axis over here I plot

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:20,065
the price of a product and lets say this vertical axis over here i plot the demand for the product, and

4
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:24,498
i'm only plotting the first quadrant here because i'm assuming that the price can only be positive and

5
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:30,320
i'm assuming that the demand can only be positive, that people aren't going to pay someone to take the product

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,114
away from them. So let's think about what would happen for the price and demand for most normal products.

7
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:43,231
So, if the price is low, you would expect that a lot of poeple are willing to buy that thing they're

8
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,652
like "Oh it's a good price, i would like to buy it."

9
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:51,163
So, if the price is low, then the demand would be high so maybe it would be somplace over here, all the

10
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:54,697
way that you would have really high demand if the price was zero.

11
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:58,581
so if the price was low the deamnd would be high.

12
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:02,331
Now what happens is the price -- so right here the price is low, demand is high, if the price were to

13
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:06,464
go up a little bit then maybe the demand goes down a little bit, right?

14
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,280
price went up a little bit demand went down a little bit.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,165
if the price went up a little bit more then maybe demand goes down a little bit more.

16
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:17,849
as the price went up a bunch then demand would go down a bunch and so the line that represents how the

17
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:28,115
demand relates to price might look something like this, and i'm just going to assume it's

18
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:33,099
it a line. It might not be a line, it might be a curve. It might look something like that.

19
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:37,766
Or it might look something like that. But in general is someone were to ask you,

20
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:43,030
if you saw this magenta curve that as price increases what happens to demand.

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,931
You just say "Well look price increases, as price increases what happens to demand?"

22
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:53,731
Well demand is decreasing. Now let's think about a different scenario.

23
00:01:53,731 --> 00:02:02,951
Let's talk about the demand for real estate. For actual property, and lets say that on this axis

24
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:08,648
that we plot the population. The population in the area, and this right over here this is

25
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:17,682
demand for land. So when the population is very low, you can imagine, if the population is

26
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:23,447
zero there is no one there that would want to buy land. So if the population is very low

27
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:26,914
the demand is going to be very low. And as population increases, demand should increase.

28
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:31,280
If the population increases, more people are going to want to buy land. And if the

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,564
population goes up a bunch then a lot of people are going to want to buy land. So you'll see a

30
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:41,364
line that looks something like this. And once again I drew a line, it doesn't have to be a line

31
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:47,581
it could be a curve of some kind. It could be a curve that looks something like that, or a curve

32
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,397
that looks something like that. We don't know but the general idea is that if someone

33
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:56,498
showed you a graph that looked like this. And as population increases what happens to demand.

34
00:02:56,498 --> 00:03:00,231
We'll you'd say "Look, this is population increasing, what happens to demand?" Demand

35
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:07,049
is going up. Where as price increased the demand went down. Here as population is increasing

36
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:12,180
demand went up. And you can just make that more general with variables. We're talking about

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,298
specific cases here. But if I were to plot something like this, if you were to see a graph that

38
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:26,479
looked like that and this is the variable x and this is the variable y. And someone were to ask you what

39
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:38,465
happens to y as x increases. Well you take any x that's the y that we have for that x.

40
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:42,713
And as you increase x, as you move in the positive horizontal directions. As you increase

41
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:49,850
x what is happening to y? Y is going up. So for this example, as x increases

42
00:03:49,850 --> 00:04:00,098
y is increasing. If we had a graph that looked like this. Let's call that the

43
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:05,530
a axis and this is the b axis and maybe our graph looked like this.

44
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:14,281
What happens as A increases? If you pick an A right over here. We're at that A and that B.

45
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:24,897
As A increases what's happening to B? Well as A increases our B is lower. As A

46
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:32,931
increases here B is decreasing. So, just wanting to give you a general idea, when X and Y increased

47
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:39,864
together the line goes from the bottom left to the top right, we would call this an upward sloping line.

48
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:49,115
We would call this a positive slope. Everytime X is increased Y also increases is upwards sloping.

49
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:54,857
When our independant variable increases and our dependent variable decreases.

50
00:04:54,857 --> 00:05:05,466
When the independent variable is increasing, then you say it has a downward slope, when you go from the top left to the bottom right.
