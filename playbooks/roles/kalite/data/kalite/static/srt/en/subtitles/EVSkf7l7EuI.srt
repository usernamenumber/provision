99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video we had a little bit of a review of classical economics.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And why it might have made sense in the context of the great depression

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the economy was operating well below its potential.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I want to do, and it may be true anytime that the economy is operating well below its potential,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but what I want to talk about in this video is how Keynesian thinking can sometimes be dangerous.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And one thing I do want to emphasize over the course of this video is

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Keynesian policies are often associated with people on the left,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with policies on the left, the democrats in the United States, but the Republicans

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
also are for the most part, especially mainstream Republicans, especially the last several

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
administrations, they have practiced what are-what can only be described as Keynesian policies.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When the economy started to recede, they tried to stimulate it by shifting aggregate demand

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the right somehow. And we'll talk about that they tried to do it in a slightly

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
different way through tax cuts instead of government increases, spending increases

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it was Keynesian in its underlying thinking.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now just as a bit of a kind of backup, I want to talk a little bit more a about that cycle

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we talked about in the last video.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you had person A, person B, person C, and person D and maybe their firms.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And B supplies A, A supplies D, D supplies C, and C supplies B.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And for the sake of simplicity we'll say that they're all supplying two units

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of their good and service to each other. And let's just say that C has a bad dream,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
feels pessimistic, ate something bad and all of a sudden isn't feeling good about the future

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and wants to buy less just out of caution, maybe wants to hoard a little bit of cash and things

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just in case C needs it.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so he buys a little bit less from D, so he buys a little bit less than D.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But D says "gee my business is bad, now I can't afford as many goods and services",

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
buys less from A, A does the same thing from B, and then B's business is bad

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so buys less stuff from C, goods and services from C,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now C feels like they're psychic.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Even though we see that it was actually a self fulfilling prophecy,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that C's pessimism actually led to that reality actually occurring.
