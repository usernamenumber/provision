1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,540
What I want to do in this video
is establish a reasonably

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,540
powerful condition in which we
can establish that at vector

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,350
field, or that a line integral
of a vector field is

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,670
path independent.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,420
And when I say that, I mean
that let's say I were to take

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:21,780
this line integral along the
path c of f dot d r, and let's

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,310
say my path looks like this.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,110
   

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:34,020
That's my x and y axis, and
let's say my path looks

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,530
something like this: I start
there and I go over

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,510
there to point c.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,050
My end point, the
curve here is c.

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,210
And so I would evaluate this
line integral, this victor

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,640
field along this path.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,420
This would be a path
independent vector field, or we

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:59,890
call that a conservative vector
field, if this thing is equal

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:06,370
to the same integral over a
different path that has

19
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,240
the same end point.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,250
So let's call this c1, so
this is c1, and this is c2.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,680
This vector field is
conservative if I start

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,530
at the same point but I
take a different path.

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,050
Let's say I go something like
that: if I take a different

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,600
path-- and this is my c2 --I
still get the same value.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,190
What this is telling me is that
all it cares about to evaluate

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,980
these integrals is my starting
point and my ending point.

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,750
It doesn't care what
I do in between.

28
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,410
It doesn't care how I get
from my starting point

29
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,140
to my end point.

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,610
These two integrals have the
same start point and same end

31
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,320
point, so irregardless of
their actual path, they're

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,350
going to be the same.

33
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,530
That's what it means for f to
be a conservative field, or

34
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,670
what it means for this integral
to be path independent.

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,080
So before I prove or I show you
the conditions, let's build

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,560
up our tool kit a little bit.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,750
And so you may or may not
have already seen the

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,590
multivariable chain rule.

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,220
   

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,850
And I'm not going to prove
it in this video, but I

41
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,390
think it'll be pretty
intuitive for you.

42
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,000
So maybe it doesn't need to
have a proof, or I'll prove it

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
eventually, but I really just
want to give you the intuition.

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,610
And all that says is that if I
have some function-- let's say

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,860
I have f of x and y, but x and
y are then functions of, let's

46
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:37,220
say a third variable, t, so f
of x of t and y of t --that the

47
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:45,720
derivative of f with respect
to t is multivariable.

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,000
I have two variables
here in x and y.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,810
This is going to be equal
to the partial of f

50
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,350
with respect to x.

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,130
How fast does f change as x
changes times the derivative of

52
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,120
x with respect to t-- This is a
single variable function right

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,780
here, so you to take a
regular derivative.

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,140
So times how fast x changes
with respect to t.

55
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,680
This is a standard derivative,
this is a partial derivative,

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,290
because at that level we're
dealing with two variables.

57
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,280
And we're not done. --plus how
fast f changes with respect to

58
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,960
y times the derivative
y with respected t.

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,110
So d y d t.

60
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,490
And I'm not going to prove
it, but I think it makes

61
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,730
pretty good intuition.

62
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,950
This is saying, as I move
a little bit d t, how

63
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,290
much of a d f do I get?

64
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,200
Or how fast this f change
with respect to t?

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
It says, well there's two ways
that f can change: it can

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,670
change with respect to x and it
can change with respect to y.

67
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,170
So why don't I add those two
things together as they're both

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,020
changing with respect to t?

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,940
That's all it's saying, and if
you kind of imagined that you

70
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,090
could cancel out this partial x
with this d x, and this partial

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,550
y with this d y, you could kind
of imagine the partial of f

72
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,200
with respect to t on the x side
of things, and then plus the

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,650
partial of f with respect
to t in the y dimension.

74
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,930
And then that'll give you
the total change of f

75
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,150
with respected to t.

76
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,560
Kind of a hand-wavy argument
there, but at least to me this

77
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,900
is a pretty intuitive formula.

78
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,420
So that's our tool kit right
there; the multivariable

79
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,450
chain rule.

80
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,040
We're going to put that
aside for a second.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,090
Now let's say I have some
vector field f-- and it's

82
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,100
different than this f, so I'll
do it in a different color;

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,660
magenta --I have some
vector field f that is a

84
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,920
function of x and y.

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,380
And let's say that it happens
to be the gradient of

86
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,705
some scalar field.

87
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:46,910
   

88
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,440
I'll call that capital F.

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,060
And this is gradient which
means that capital F is also

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,230
function of x and y-- so I
don't want to write it on a new

91
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,890
line, I could also write up
here; capital F is also a

92
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,470
function of x and y --and the
gradient, and all that means is

93
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,150
that the vector field f of xy--
lower-case f of xy, is equal to

94
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,710
the partial derivative of
upper-case F with respect to x

95
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,250
times the i-unit vector plus
the partial of upper-case F

96
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,690
with respect to y times
the j-unit vector.

97
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,170
This is the definition of
the gradient right here.

98
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,480
And if you imagine that
upper-case F is some type of

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:48,530
surface-- so this is uppercase
F of xy --the gradient F of xy

100
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,390
is going to be a vector field
that tells you the direction of

101
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,440
steepest descent at any point.

102
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,740
So it'll be defined
the xy plane.

103
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,060
So on the xy plane it'll tell
you-- so let me draw; that's

104
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,820
the vertical axis, maybe that's
the x axis, that's the y axis

105
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,150
--so the gradient of it, if you
take any point on the xy plane,

106
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,240
it'll tell you the direction
you need to travel to go

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,610
into the deepest descent.

108
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,320
And for this gradient
field it's going to be

109
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,700
something like this.

110
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,450
   

111
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,730
And maybe over here it starts
going in that direction because

112
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,800
you would descend towards
this little minimum

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,260
point right here.

114
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,770
Anyway, I don't want
to get too involved.

115
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,960
And the whole point of this
isn't to really get the

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,050
intuition behind gradients;
there are other videos on this.

117
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,960
The point of this is to get
other a test to see whether

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,290
something is path independent;
whether a vector field is path

119
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,050
independent, whether
it's conservative.

120
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,010
And it turns out that if this
exists-- and I'm going to prove

121
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:57,350
it now --if f is the gradient
of some scalar field,

122
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,630
then f is conservative.

123
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,570
   

124
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,900
Or you could say it doesn't
matter what path we follow when

125
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,670
we take a line integral over f,
it just matters about our

126
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,950
starting point and
our ending point.

127
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,030
Now let me see if I can
prove that to you.

128
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,820
So let's start with the
assumption that f can be

129
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,560
written this way, as the
gradient, that lower-case f can

130
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,120
be written as the gradient
of some upper-case F.

131
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:36,490
So in that case our integral--
well, let's define

132
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,510
our path first.

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,310
So our position vector
function-- we always need one

134
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,250
of those to do a line integral
or a vector line integral --r

135
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:52,890
of t is going to be equal to x
of t times i plus y of t times

136
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,770
j 4t going between a and b.

137
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,730
You've seen this multiple
times; this is a definition

138
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,950
of pretty much any path
in two dimensions.

139
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:13,270
And then we're going to say f
of xy is going to be equal to

140
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,760
this: it's going to be the
partial derivative of uppercase

141
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,740
F with respect to x-- so we're
assuming that this exists, that

142
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,790
this is true --times i plus
the partial of upper-case F

143
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,210
with respect to y times j.

144
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:42,470
Now, given this what is
lower-case f dot dr going

145
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,080
to equal over this
path right here?

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,660
This path is defined by this
position function right there.

147
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,970
Well, it's going to be equal
to, we need to figure out

148
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,280
what dr is, and we've done
that in multiple videos.

149
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,480
I'll do that on the
right over here.

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,740
dr, we've seen it
multiple times.

151
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,980
Actually, I'll solve
it out again.

152
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:11,590
dr over dt by definition was
equal to dx over dt times i

153
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,960
plus-- I don't know why it
got all fat like that

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,070
--dy over dt times j.

155
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,630
That's what dr over dt is.

156
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,320
So if we want to figure out
what dr is, the differential of

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
dr, if we want to play with
differentials in this way,

158
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,490
multiply both sides times dt.

159
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,520
And actually I'm going to
treat dt, I'll multiply

160
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,670
it; I'll distribute it.

161
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:44,030
It's dx over dt times dti
plus dy over dt times dtj.

162
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,460
So if we're taking the dot
product of f with dr, what

163
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,060
are we going to get?

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,080
   

165
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,960
So this is going to be the
integral over the curve from--

166
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,840
I'll write the c right there;
we could write in terms of the

167
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,790
end points as t once we feel
good that we have everything in

168
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,560
terms of t --but it's going to
be equal to this dot that,

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,510
which is equal to-- I'll try to
stay color consistent --the

170
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,450
partial of upper-case F with
respect to x times that, times

171
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,520
dx over d t-- I'm going to
write this st in a different

172
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:35,850
color --times dt plus the
partial of upper-case F with

173
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,020
respect to y times--
we're multiplying the

174
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,950
j components, right?

175
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,170
When you take the dot product,
multiply the i components, and

176
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,680
then add that to what you get
from the product of the j

177
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,400
components --so this j
component's partial of

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,830
upper-case F with respect to y,
and then we have times-- switch

179
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:03,680
to a yellow --dy over dt times
that dt right over there.

180
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,790
And then we can
factor out the dt.

181
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,860
   

182
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,300
Or actually, so I don't have to
even write it again, right now

183
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,800
I wrote it without, well
let me write it again.

184
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,035
So this is equal
to the integral.

185
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,420
And let's say we have it in
terms of t; we've written

186
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,760
everything in terms of t, so t
goes from a to b, and so this

187
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,150
is going to be equal to-- I'll
write it in blue --the partial

188
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:33,610
of upper case F with respect to
x times dx over dt plus-- I'm

189
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,980
distributing this dt out --plus
the partial of uppercase

190
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,910
F with respect to y.

191
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,200
dy over dt.

192
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,530
all of that times dt.

193
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,190
This is equivalent to that.

194
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,950
Now you might realize
why I talked about the

195
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,640
multivariable chain rule.

196
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,480
What is this right here?

197
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,100
What is that right there?

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,050
You can do some
pattern matching.

199
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:04,180
That is the same thing as the
derivative of upper-case

200
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,950
F with respect to t.

201
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,980
Look at this; let me let me
copy and paste that just

202
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,940
so you appreciate it.

203
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:17,170
   

204
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,370
So this is our definition, or
this is our-- I won't say

205
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,920
definition; one can
actually prove it.

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,040
You don't have to start from
there ---but this is our

207
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,220
multivariable chain
rule right here.

208
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,890
The driven of any function with
respect t is the partial of

209
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,400
that function with respect to x
times dx over dt plus the

210
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,830
partial of that function
with respect to dy over dt.

211
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,710
I have the partial of
upper-case F with respect to

212
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,650
x times dx over dt plus the
partial upper-case F

213
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,130
with respect to y.

214
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,340
This and this are identical
if you just replace this

215
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
lower-case f with
an upper-case F.

216
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,470
So this in blue right here,
this whole expression is equal

217
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:57,500
to the integral from t is equal
to a to t is equal to b of-- in

218
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:07,250
blue here --the derivative
of f with respect to dt.

219
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,030
And how do you evaluate--
let me just the dt in green

220
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,980
--how do you evaluate
something like this?

221
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,790
I just want to make a point:
this is just this from the

222
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,540
multivariable chain rule.

223
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,610
And how do you evaluate a
definite integral like this?

224
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,430
Well, you take the
antiderivative of the

225
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,120
inside with respect to dt.

226
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,730
So what is this going
to be equal to?

227
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,030
You take the antiderivative of
the inside, that's just f.

228
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,192
So this is equal to f of t.

229
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,410
And let me be clear.

230
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,690
We wrote before that
f is a function.

231
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,330
So our upper-case F is a
function of x and y, which

232
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,390
could also be written, since
each of these are functions

233
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,310
of t, could be written as
f of x of t of y of t.

234
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm just rewriting it
in different ways.

235
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,430
And this could be just
written as f or t.

236
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,550
These are all equivalent,
depending on whether you want

237
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,490
to include the x's or the
y's only, or the t's

238
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,310
only, or them both.

239
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,370
Because both of the x's and
y's are functions of t.

240
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,650
So this is the derivative
of f with respect to t.

241
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,880
If this was just in terms of
t, this is the derivative

242
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,390
of that with respect to t.

243
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,880
We take its antiderivative,
we're left just with f, and we

244
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,540
have to evaluate it from t is
equal to a to t is equal to b.

245
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,730
And so this is equal to-- and
this is the home stretch

246
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,910
--this is equal to f
of b minus f of a.

247
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,170
And if you want to think about
it in these terms, this

248
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,260
is the same thing.

249
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:46,560
This is equal to f of x of b
over y of b-- let me make sure

250
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,970
I got all the parentheses
--minus f of x of

251
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,330
a over y of a.

252
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,660
These are equivalent.

253
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,320
You give me any point on the
xy plane, an x and a y, and

254
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,070
it tells me where I am.

255
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,220
This is my capital F,
it gives me a height.

256
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,800
Just like that.

257
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,652
This associates a value with
every point on the xy plane.

258
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:13,370
But this whole exercise,
remember this is the

259
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,280
same thing as that.

260
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,010
This is our whole thing that we
were trying to prove: that is

261
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:25,300
equal to f dot dr. f dot dr,
our vector field, which is the

262
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,890
gradient of the capital F--
remember F was equal to the

263
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,000
gradient of F, we assume that
it's the gradient of some

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,800
function capital F, if that is
the case, then we just did a

265
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,180
little bit of calculus or
algebra, whatever you want to

266
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,150
call it, and we found that we
can evaluate this integral by

267
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,170
evaluating capital F at t is
equal to b, and then

268
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,570
subtracting from that capital
F at t is equal to a.

269
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,860
But what that tells you is that
this integral, the value of

270
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,980
this integral, is only
dependent at our starting

271
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,090
point, t is equal to a, this is
the point x of a, y of a, and

272
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:13,810
the ending point, t is equal to
b, which is x of b, y of b.

273
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,020
That integral is only dependent
on these two values.

274
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,300
How do I know that?

275
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,340
Because to solve it-- because
I'm saying that this thing

276
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,880
exists --I just had to evaluate
that thing at those two

277
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,890
points; I didn't care about
the curve in between.

278
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:34,450
So this shows that if F is
equal to the gradient-- this

279
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,340
is often called a potential
function of capital F, although

280
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,590
they're usually the negative
each other, but it's the same

281
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,220
idea --if the vector field f is
the gradient of some scale or

282
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:56,490
field upper-case F, then we can
say that f is conservative or

283
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,980
that the line integral of f
dot dr is path independent.

284
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,420
It doesn't matter what path we
go on as long as our starting

285
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
and ending point are the same.

286
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,580
Hopefully found that useful.

287
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,680
And we'll some
examples with that.

288
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,990
And actually in the next video
I'll prove another interesting

289
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,480
outcome based on this one.
