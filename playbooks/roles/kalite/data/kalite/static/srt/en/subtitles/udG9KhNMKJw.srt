1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,340
So let's start again with a fair coin, and this time,

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,280
instead of flipping it four times

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,710
let's flip it five times

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,730
Five flips of this fair coin

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,540
And what I want to think about in this video

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:21,850
is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads.

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,840
And the way I'm going to think about it is

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,280
if you have five flips how many different,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,500
equally likely possibilities are there?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,040
So you're going to have the first flip,

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,490
and there's two possibilities there,

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,620
heads or tails; second flip, two possibilities there;

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,710
third flip, two possibilities; fourth flip,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,700
two possibilities; fifth flip, two possibilities.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,590
That's two times two times

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,890
two times two times two (I hope I said that five times!).

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,580
So, two, or you could use just two to the fifth power

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,650
and that is going to be equal to thirty-two

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,420
equally likely possibilities.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,280
Thirty-two: Two times two is four,

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,610
sixteen times two is thirty-two possibilities.

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,400
And to figure out this probability,

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,310
we really just have to figure out

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:10,620
how many of those possibilities involve getting three heads.

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,420
We could draw it right out,

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,010
all of the thirty-two possibilities,

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,520
and literally just count the heads,

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,350
but let's just use that other technique that

29
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,190
we just started to explore in that last video.

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,700
We have five flips here (Let me draw the flips).

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,880
And we want to have exactly three heads,

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,720
and I'm going to call those three heads

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,010
Heads A, Heads B, Heads C, just to give them a name,

34
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,800
although what we're going to see later in this video

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,040
is that we don't want to differentiate between them.

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,590
To us, it makes no difference if we get this ordering:

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,170
Heads A, Heads B, Heads C, tails, tails;

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,420
or if we get this ordering:

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,800
Heads A, Heads C, or Heads B, tails tails.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,940
We can't count these as two different orderings,

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,490
we can only count this as one.

42
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,480
So what we're going to do is first come up with

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,460
all of the different ordering

44
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,440
if we cared about the difference between A and B and C.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,390
And then we are going to divide by the,

46
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,350
all of the different ways

47
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,850
that you could arrange three different things.

48
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,330
So how many ways can we put A,B and C into these five buckets

49
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,170
that we can view as the flips if we cared about A, B and C.

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,730
So let's start with A.

51
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,460
If we haven't allocate any of these buckets to

52
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,030
any of the heads that we could say A

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,940
could be in five different buckets,

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,170
so there is five different possibilities where A could be.

55
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,640
So let's just say, that you know,

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,710
this is the one that

57
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,350
goes in although could be any one of these five.

58
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,540
But this takes one of the five,

59
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,880
then how many different possibilities can these heads sit in?

60
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,080
How many different possibilities are there?

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,500
Well then there is only going to be four buckets left,

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,440
so then there is only four possibilities.

63
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,480
And so if this was where the Heads A goes

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,660
and Heads B can be any of the other four.

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,820
Heads A was in this first one and then Heads B

66
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,080
could be in any of the other four.

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,400
I'll do a particular example maybe Heads B,

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,530
shows up right there.

69
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,870
So once you take two of the slots,

70
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,550
how many spaces do we have for Heads C?

71
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,620
Well we only have three spaces left then, for Heads C.

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,130
That can be any of these three spaces that could just

73
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,150
show particular example of what looked like that.

74
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,110
If you cared about order,

75
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,450
hwo many different ways can you out of five different spaces,

76
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,800
allocated them to three different heads?

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,410
You would say it is five times 4 times 3.

78
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,650
Five times four is twenty times three is equal to sixty.

79
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,030
So you will say there are sixty different ways to

80
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,320
arrange Heads A, B and C in five buckets or five flips

81
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,710
or these are people in five chairs.

82
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,950
And obviously there are sixty possibilities of

83
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,840
getting three heads

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,560
if I had only 32 equally likely possibilities.

85
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,960
And the reason why we got such a big number over here is that

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,050
we are counting this scenario as being fundamentally

87
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,830
different than this was Heads B,

88
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,050
Heads A and then Heads C, over here.

89
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,710
And what we need to do is to say

90
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,190
they aren't different possibilities.

91
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,530
We don't have to, kind of,

92
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,190
we don't have to overcount for

93
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,790
all of the different ways you arrange this.

94
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,860
And so what we need to do is divide this

95
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,360
by all of the different ways that

96
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
you can arrange three things.

97
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,050
So if I have three things that in three spaces,

98
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,970
so here I have a Heads in the second flip,

99
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,820
third flip and fifth flip.

100
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,380
If I have three things in three spaces like this,

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,500
how many ways can I arrange them?

102
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,770
So if I have three spaces, how many ways can I arrange?

103
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,420
And A, B and C in those three spaces.

104
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,940
Well A can go into three spaces.

105
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,790
It can go any of those three.

106
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,230
A can go into any of the three spaces.

107
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,260
Then B would have two spaces left once A takes one of them.

108
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,350
And then C would have one of these spaces left,

109
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,900
once A and B take two of them.

110
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,740
So there is three times two times one way

111
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,280
to arrange three different things.

112
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,980
So three times two times one is equal to six.

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,550
So the number of possibilities of getting three heads

114
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,050
Let me write this down in another color.

115
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:33,940
So the number of possibilities is equal to this

116
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:47,410
five times four times three over the number of ways that

117
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,090
I can well arrange three things.

118
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,760
We don't want to overcount for all of these,

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,570
doing this arrange is fundamentally different

120
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,530
than this arrangement.

121
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,790
Then we want to divided by three times two,

122
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,610
I want to do this in same orange color,

123
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,830
dividing by three times two times one.

124
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,900
Three times two times one and which gives us,

125
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,990
the numerator is one hundred and twenty,

126
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,700
one hundred and twenty divided by six, sorry,

127
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:29,110
it's sixty divided by six, which gives us ten possibilities.

128
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,910
This gives us exactly three heads.

129
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,780
And that's of 32 equally likely possibilities.

130
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,220
So the probability of getting eaxctly three heads,

131
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,690
when you getting exactly three heads

132
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,820
in 10 of the 32 equally likely possibilities.

133
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,360
So you have a 5/16 chance of that happening.
