1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:08,563
You are by now probably used to the idea of measuring angles in degrees.

2
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:13,156
We use it in everyday language, we've done some examples on........

3
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:17,672
where if you had an angle like that, you might call that a 30 degree

4
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:23,722
30 degree angle if you had an angle like this call that a 90 degree angle

5
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:26,582
you'd often use a symbol just like that.

6
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:32,261
If you were to go a 180 degrees, you'd essentially form a straight line.

7
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:41,650
You go 360 degrees, you've essentially done one full rotation

8
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,130
and if you watch figure skating on the olympics and someone does a rotation they say

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,942
"Oh! they did a 360" or espescially in some type of some skateboarding competitions and things like that.

10
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:54,389
But the one thing to realize is that it might not be obvious from the get-go

11
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,655
but this whole notion of degrees, this is a human constructed system.

12
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,539
this is not the only way that you can measure angles.

13
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,277
And if you think about it yourselves,

14
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:06,200
Why do we call a full rotation 360 degrees?

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,730
And there's some possible theories and I encourage you to think about them,

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,429
Why does 360 degrees show up in our culture as a full rotation?

17
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:16,829
Well, there's a couple of theories there...

18
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,393
One is ancient calenders and even our calenders close to this,

19
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:24,949
but ancient calenders were based on 360 days in a year

20
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:28,430
Some ancient astronomers observed that things seemed to move

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,437
one 360th of the sky per day.

22
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:35,807
Another theory is that the ancient babylonians

23
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:40,343
liked equilateral triangles a lot and they had a base 60 number system.

24
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,890
So they had 60 symbols, we only have 10.

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,753
We have a base 10 and they had 60.

26
00:01:44,753 --> 00:01:48,996
So in our system we like to divide things under ten, they liked to divide under 60.

27
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:54,612
So if you were to, if you had a circle and you divided it into 6 equilateral triangles.

28
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:59,572
And each of those equilateral triangles you divided into 60 sections

29
00:01:59,572 --> 00:02:02,120
cause you have a base 60 number system.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,104
And you might end up with 360 degrees.

31
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:10,336
What I want to think about in this video is an alternate way of measuring angles.

32
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:14,876
And that alternate way, even though it might not seem intuitive to you from the get-go

33
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,809
in some ways is much more mathematically pure,

34
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:22,326
than degrees. It's not based on the cultural artifacts of base 60 number system

35
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,276
or, astronomical patterns.

36
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:29,717
To some degree an alien on another planet would not use degrees,

37
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:33,353
especially if degrees are motivated by astronomical phenomena

38
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,021
But they might use what we are going to define as a radian.

39
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:43,009
Tere's a certain degree of purity here, Radians.

40
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,268
So, lets just cut to the cheese and define what a radian is,

41
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:52,828
so let me draw a circle here, my best attempt at drawing a circle.

42
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:56,806
Not bad, and let me draw,

43
00:02:56,806 --> 00:03:01,683
centre of the circle and now let me draw this radius,

44
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,343
and lets say that this radius,

45
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:06,210
you might already notice that this word radius is very close to the word radian.

46
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,178
And that's not a coincidence.

47
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:12,833
So let's say that this radius, the circle has a radius of length r.

48
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,505
Now lets construct an angle, I'll call that angle theta.

49
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,631
So lets construct an angle theta.

50
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:23,037
So let's call this this angle right over here theta and

51
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:29,653
let's just say for the sake of argument that this angle is just the exact right measure,

52
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:34,580
so that if you look at the arc that subtends this angle,

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,855
That seems like a very fancy word.

54
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:42,456
So let me draw the angle, so if you look at the arc that subtends the angle

55
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,855
that seems like a fancy word

56
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:50,609
and that's just talking about the arc along the circle that intersects the sides of theses two angles

57
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,748
So this arc right over here subtends angle, this is the angle theta.

58
00:03:55,748 --> 00:04:03,516
So let me write this down, subtends this arc, subtends angle theta.

59
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,812
Lets say theta's exactly the right size, so this arc is also the same length as the radius of the circle

60
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:13,789
so this arc is also of length r.

61
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:19,572
So given that if you were to find a new type of angle measurement and,

62
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:24,684
you wanted to call it a radian which is very close to a radius.

63
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:28,943
How many radians would you define this angle to be ?

64
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:36,071
Well, the most obvious one, if you kind of view a radian as another way of saying radiusss or I guess a radii...

65
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:41,674
Well, you say look, this is subtended by an arc of one radius.

66
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:45,985
So why don't we this right over here one radian?

67
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,306
Why don't we call this one radian?

68
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,827
Which is exactly how a radian is defined,

69
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:54,061
When you have a circle and you have an angle of one radian,

70
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,827
the arc that subtends it is exactly one radius long.

71
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:03,913
Which you can imagine might be a little useful as we start to interpret more and more types of circles,

72
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:08,259
When you give in degrees, you have to do math and you have to think about the circumference and all of that

73
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,512
To think about how many radiuses are subtending an angle.

74
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:18,515
Here the angle in radians tells you exactly how many arc length is subtending the angle.

75
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:22,553
So let's do a couple of broad experiments here.

76
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:29,128
So, given that what would be the angle in radians if we were to go,

77
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:38,745
so let me draw another circle here.....

78
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:42,197
that's the center, start right over there.

79
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:46,977
So what would happen if I had an angle, what angle if I were to measure in radian,

80
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:52,316
what angle would this be in radian? You can almost think of it as radiussssss.....

81
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:55,199
So what would that angle be? Going one full revolution,

82
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,557
In degrees that would be 360 degrees. What would you, based on this definition,

83
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,585
What would this be in radians?

84
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:10,567
Well, lets think about the arc that subtends this angle is the entire circumference of this circle.

85
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:19,483
Its the entire circumference of this circle.

86
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:24,731
Well what's the circumference of a circle in terms of radiussss?

87
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:31,593
So if this is length r, what's the circumference of the circle in terms of r?

88
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:37,855
Well we know that it's gonna be 2 pi r.

89
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:43,485
So going back to this angle, how many... whats the length of the arc that subtends this angle?

90
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:48,108
How many radiusss? Well, it's two pi radiussss....

91
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:57,785
Its two pi times r. So this angle right over here , this angle, I'll call this a different.. lets call this angle x.

92
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:02,339
x in this case is going to be two pi radians.

93
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:08,607
And it is subtended by an arc of length two pi radiussss....

94
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:14,938
If the radius was one unit then this would be two pi times one, two pi radiusss...

95
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:23,780
So, given that, lets start to think about how we can convert radians and degrees and vice versa.

96
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,932
If I were to have, and we can just follow up over here.

97
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:38,370
To do one full revolution, that is two pi radians, how many degrees is this going to be equal to?

98
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:47,064
Well we already know this. A full revolution in degrees is 360 degrees.

99
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:50,077
Well I could either write degrees or I could use this degree notation there,

100
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:55,482
Actually let me write the word degrees. It might make thing a bit clearer that we're kind of using units in both cases.

101
00:07:55,482 --> 00:08:00,070
Now if we wanted to simplify this a little bit, we could divide both sides by 2,

102
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,429
in which case we would get on the left hand side, we would get pi radians would be equal to how many degrees?

103
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:11,563
Welll, it'd be equal to 180 degrees.

104
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:20,049
180 degrees and I could write it that way or I could write it that way.

105
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,707
And you see over here, this is a 180 degrees and

106
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:29,863
you also see if you were to draw a circle around here you've got halfway around the circle

107
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:38,329
so the arc length or the arc that subtends the angle is half the circumference, half the circumference or pi radiusss...

108
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,853
So we call this pi radians. pi radians is a 180 degrees.

109
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:45,919
And from this we can come up with conversions.

110
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,590
So one radian would be how many degrees?

111
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:56,703
Well to do that, we just have to divide both sides by pi and on the left hand side you'd be left with one,

112
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,526
I'll just write it singular now, one radian is equal to,

113
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:04,862
I'm just dividing both sides, let me make it clear what I'm doing here just to show you it not voodoo.

114
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:10,131
So, I'm just dividing both sides by pi here. On the left hand side we're left with one

115
00:09:10,131 --> 00:09:14,898
and on the right hand side we're left with 180 over pi degrees.

116
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:24,063
So 1 radian = 180 over pi degrees.

117
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,055
Which is starting to make an interesting way to convert them.

118
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:31,923
Let's think about it the other way, if I were to have one degree, how many radians is that?

119
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:38,125
Well, let's start off with, let me rewrite this thing over here.

120
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:50,125
We said, pi radians is equal to 180 degrees.

121
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,708
So now we want to think about one degree. So let's solve for one degree,

122
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,943
we could divide both sides by 180.

123
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:01,217
We are left with pi over 180 radians is equal to 1 degree.

124
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:10,590
So pi over 180 radians is equal to one degree.

125
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,977
This might seem confusing and daunting and it was for me the first time ......

126
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:17,212
Specially because we're not exposed to this in our everyday life.

127
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:20,987
What we're gonna see over the next few examples is that as long as we keep in mind,

128
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:25,395
this whole idea that two pi radians is equal to 360 degrees or pi radians is equal to 180 degrees,

129
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:29,134
which is the two things that I do keep in my mind.

130
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,119
We can always re derive these two things.

131
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:35,872
You might say, "Hey how do I remember if its pi over 180 or 180 over pi?"

132
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:42,940
To convert the two things, well just remember and which is hopefully intuitive that two pi radians = 360 degrees.

133
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,539
And we'll work through a bunch of examples in the next video,

134
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,539
to just make sure that we're used to converting one way or the other. ENDSs.
