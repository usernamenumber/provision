1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:03,589
So let's just review what we've seen with budget lines.

2
00:00:03,589 --> 00:00:09,369
Let's say I'm making $20 a month. So my income is $20 per month.

3
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:18,512
The price of chocolate is one dollar per bar.

4
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:23,946
And at the price of fruit is two dollars per pound.

5
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:28,591
And we've already done this before but I'll just redraw a budget line.

6
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:33,500
So this axis, let's say this is the quantity of chocolate.
I could've picked it either way.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,913
And that is the quantity of fruit.

8
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,443
Not quantity of four. Quantity of fruit.

9
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:46,108
If I spent all my money on chocolate I could buy 20 bars of chocolate a month. So that is 20.

10
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:53,254
This is 10 right over here. At these prices if I spent all of my money on fruit I could buy 10 lbs. per month.

11
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:55,710
So this is 10. That's 10 pounds per month.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,506
So I have a budget line that looks like this. A budget line that looks like this.

13
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:06,304
And the equation of this budget line is going to be -- well, I could write it like this.

14
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,712
My budget (20) is going to be equal to the price of chocolate,

15
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:16,336
which is 1 times the quantity of chocolate. So this is 1 times the quantity of chocolate.

16
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:22,002
Plus the price of fruit, which is 2, times the quantity of fruit.

17
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:29,237
And if want to write this explicitly in terms of my quantity of chocolate, since I put that on my vertical axis,

18
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:34,774
since that tends to be the more dependent axis, I can just subtract 2 times the quantity of fruit from both sides.

19
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:42,845
And I can flip them and get my quantity of chocolate is equal to 20 minus 2 times my quantity of fruit.

20
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:44,772
And I get this budget line right over there.

21
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,639
We've also looked at the idea of an indifference curve.

22
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:51,506
So, for example, let's say I'm sitting at some point on my budget line

23
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:57,676
where I have - let's say I am consuming 18 bars of chocolate and one pound of fruit.

24
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:01,503
18. And you can verify that and it makes sense. It's going to be $18 plus 2 is $20.

25
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:07,425
So let's say I'm at this point on my budget line. 18 bars of chocolate -

26
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:14,847
so this is in bars - and one pound of fruit per month. That is 1 and this is in pounds.

27
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:19,920
And this is chocolate. And this is fruit right over here.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,510
Well, we know we have this idea of an indifference curve;

29
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,920
there's different combinations of chocolate and fruit to which we are indifferent,

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,109
to which we would get the same exact total utility.

31
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,770
And so we can plot all those points, I'll do it in white, it could look something like this.

32
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,320
I'll do it as a dotted line. It makes it a little bit easier. I should draw it like this.

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,041
So let's say I'm indifferent between any of these points - those points over there.

34
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,267
Let me draw it a little bit better.

35
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:52,921
So between any of these points right over there. So, for example, I could have 18 bars of chocolate

36
00:02:52,921 --> 00:03:00,674
and one pound of fruit, or I could have - let's say that is four bars of chocolate

37
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:06,902
and, let's see, and roughly eight pounds of fruit. I'm indifferent.

38
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:09,768
I get the same exact total utility.

39
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:14,505
Now, am I maximizing my total utility at either of those points?

40
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:20,584
Well, we've already seen that anything to the top right of our indifference curve, of this white curve over here

41
00:03:20,584 --> 00:03:24,040
Let me label this. This is our indifference curve.

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,849
Everything to the top right of our indifference curve is preferable.

43
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,310
We're going to get more total utility.

44
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,938
Let me color that in.

45
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:36,103
So everything to the top right of our indifference curve is going to be preferable.

46
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:40,295
So all of these other points on our budget line, even a few points below our budget line,

47
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,965
where we would actually save money, are preferable.

48
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:47,770
So either of these points are not going to maximize our total utility.

49
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,650
We can maximize our total utility at all these other points in between along our budget line.

50
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,512
So to actually maximize out total utility, what we want to do is find a point on our budget line

51
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:06,258
that is just tangent, that just touches at exactly one point one of our indifference curves.

52
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,779
We can have an infinite number of indifference curves. There could be one that looks like that.

53
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:12,041
There could be another indifference curve that looks like that.

54
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,190
All that says is that we are indifferent between any points on this curve.

55
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,705
And so there is an indifference curve that touches exactly this budget line,

56
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:22,342
or exactly touches the line at one point.

57
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:25,906
So I might have an indifference curve that looks like this.

58
00:04:25,906 --> 00:04:29,516
Let's do this in a vibrant color, in magenta.

59
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:32,770
So I could have an indifference curve that looks like this.

60
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,595
And because it's tangent - it touches in exactly one point - and also the slope of my indifference curve

61
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,106
which we've learned is the marginal rate of substitution,

62
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:47,260
is the exact same as the slope of our budget line right over there,

63
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,978
which we learned earlier was the relative price.

64
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:56,258
So this right here is the optimal allocation on our budget line.

65
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:59,510
That right here is optimal. And how do we know it is optimal?

66
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,503
Well, there's no other point on the budget line that is to the top right.

67
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:10,201
In fact, every other point on our budget line is to the bottom left of this indifference curve.

68
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:15,109
So every other point on our budget line is NOT preferable.

69
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:20,757
So remember, everything below an indifference curve, all this shaded area -

70
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,369
we should actually do it in another color.

71
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:25,441
Because indifference curve we are indifferent: but everything below an indifference curve -

72
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:29,713
so all of this area in green - is not preferable.

73
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:35,513
And every other point on the budget line is not preferable to that point right over there.

74
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:39,257
Because that is the only point - or I guess you could say every other point on our budget line

75
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:43,700
is NOT preferable to the points on the indifference curve.

76
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,765
So they are also not preferable to that point right over there, which acutally is on the indifference curve.

77
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:56,706
Now let's think about what happens if the price of fruit were to go down.

78
00:05:56,706 --> 00:06:04,855
So, the price of fruit were to go from $2 to $1. $2 to $1 per pound.

79
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:10,267
So if the price went from 2 to 1 dollar, then our actual budget line will look different.

80
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,439
Our new budget line -- I'll do it in blue -- would look like this.

81
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,925
If we spent all our money on chocolate we could buy 20 bars.

82
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:20,711
If we spent all of our money on fruit at the new price, we could buy 20 pounds of fruit.

83
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:28,302
So our new budget line would look something like that. Would look something like that.

84
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:35,526
So that is our new budget line. New budget line.

85
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:41,305
So now what would be the optimal allocation of our dollars? Or, the best combination that we would buy?

86
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:48,645
Well, we would do the exact same exercise. Assuming we had data on all of these indifference curves,

87
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:54,021
we would find the indifference curve that is exactly tangent to our new budget line.

88
00:06:54,021 --> 00:07:01,034
So let's say that this point right over here is exactly tangent to another indifference curve.

89
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:06,519
So just like that. There's another indifference curve that looks like that.

90
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:10,042
Try and make it a little bit neater, so it looks something like that.

91
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:16,868
And so based on how the price -- assume we have access to these many, many indifference curves

92
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:23,677
we can now see based on how a price, with all else equal, how a change in the price of fruit

93
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,117
changed the quantity of fruit we demanded.

94
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:31,112
Because now our optimal spent is this point on our new budget line,

95
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:37,509
which looks like it's about, give or take, about 10 pounds of fruit.

96
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:41,320
So all of a sudden, when we were -- let's think about just the fruit.

97
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,179
Everything else we're holding equal. So just the fruit.

98
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:51,161
When the price was two, the quantity demanded was eight pounds.

99
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:54,800
And now when the price is one, the quantity demanded is 10 pounds.

100
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,767
So what we're actually doing -- and once again we're kind of looking at the exact same ideas

101
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:03,341
from different directions. Before we looked at it in terms of marginal utility per dollar

102
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:07,512
and we thought about how you maximize it. And we were able to change the prices

103
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:12,452
and then derive a demand curve from that. Here we're just looking at it from a slightly different lens.

104
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,106
But they really are all of the same ideas.

105
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:19,100
But assuming we had access to a bunch of indifference curves,

106
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,103
we can see how a change in price changes our budget line,

107
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:28,367
and how that would change the optimal quantity we would want of a given product.

108
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:32,602
So, for example we could keep doing this and we could plot our new demand curve.

109
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:36,931
So I could do a demand curve now for fruit. At least I have two points on that demand curve.

110
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:42,268
So if this is the price of fruit, and this is the quantity demanded of fruit,

111
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:45,316
when the price is two the quantity is eight.

112
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:52,021
And when the price is -- actually let me do it a little bit different.

113
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:56,385
When the price is two, and these aren't to scale, the quantity demanded is eight.

114
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:00,195
And then -- actually I should do it here. And these aren't to scale.

115
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:07,770
When the price is one the quantity demanded is 10. Two, eight, quantity demanded is 10.

116
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,201
And so our demand curve -- these are two points on it -- we could keep changing it up.

117
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:17,520
Assuming we had access to a bunch of indifference curves, we could keep changing it up

118
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,520
and eventually plot our demand curve, that might look something like that.
