1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,980
We're asked to simplify
7x plus 10 squared.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,190
And your temptation when you see
something like this might

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,990
be to just make it 7x squared
plus 10 squared and that would

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,500
be incorrect.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,020
Remember, when you're squaring
something, you're multiplying

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,390
something by itself.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,830
So this wouldn't be 7x squared
plus 10 squared.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:31,110
This is equal to 7x plus
10 times 7x plus 10.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,460
This is not equal to-- sometimes
if you said this is

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,170
7x times 10 squared, then you
could say this is equal to 7x

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,260
squared times 10 squared.

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,740
You would be able to do it in
this situation right here.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,940
But that's not what's
going on here.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,460
This is 7x plus 10 squared,
which is just 7x plus 10 times

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,100
7x plus 10.

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,050
So let me delete
that up there.

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,450
That's probably the single
biggest point of confusion

19
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,980
when people first learn
to take a square of an

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,320
expression like this.

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,070
So always remember that it's 7x
plus 10 times 7x plus 10.

22
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,890
And now we can multiply
it out.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,790
So one, we could distribute this
yellow 7x plus 10 onto

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,480
each of the terms into
the green one.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:25,650
So it would be 7x plus 10
times 7x right here.

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,950
So we put the 7x out front.

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:34,260
And then we could say plus
7x plus 10 times 10.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,900
Or we could say plus 10
times 7 x plus 10.

29
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,240
I just distributed the 7x plus
10 on each of these terms.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,090
Then you do the distributive
property again.

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,570
7x times 7x is 49x squared.

32
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,780
7x times 10 is 70x.

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,990
And then you have 10 times
7x is another 70x.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,039
And then you have 10 times
10, which is 100.

35
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,350
Now, there's something
interesting you might want to

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,020
notice right now is that this
expression, it is the first

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,840
expression squared, right?

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,510
7x, the whole expression
squared is 49x squared.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,860
And then you do have your
last expression squared,

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,620
10 squared is 100.

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,420
But then in between, you have
the product of these two

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,080
things twice, and that's just
a byproduct of having to do

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,330
all of the different
combinations of products.

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,620
So the end expression, when you
simplify everything, it

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:48,530
becomes 49x x squared
plus 140x plus 100.

46
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,730
So if you want to remember
a quick way of squaring a

47
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,470
binomial like this, and just
remember, it is coming out of

48
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,200
this distributive property, but
if you had to do it really

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,410
fast, it's just going to be this
first term squared, which

50
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,510
is that right there, plus 2
times the product of these two

51
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,210
terms. 7x times 10 is 70x,
and then you multiply it

52
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,860
by 2, you get 140x.

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,030
You get that right there.

54
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,170
And then the last term is just
going to be the square of the

55
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,280
second term right there.

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,470
10 squared is 100.

57
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,733
