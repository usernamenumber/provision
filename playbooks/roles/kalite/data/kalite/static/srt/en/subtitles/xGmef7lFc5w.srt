1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,960
We have the equation negative 5x
plus 4y is equal to 20, and

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,820
we're told to find the
intercepts of this equation.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,500
So we have to find the
intercepts and then use the

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,310
intercepts to graph this line
on the coordinate plane.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,850
So then graph the line.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,120
So whenever someone talks about
intercepts, they're

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,330
talking about where you're
intersecting

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,970
the x and the y-axes.

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,880
So let me label my axes here, so
this is the x-axis and that

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,120
is the y-axis there.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,290
And when I intersect the x-axis,
what's going on?

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,010
What is my y value when
I'm at the x-axis?

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,660
Well, my y value is 0, I'm not
above or below the x-axis.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,100
Let me write this down.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:01,600
The x-intercept is when y
is equal to 0, right?

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,300
And then by that same
argument, what's the

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,550
y-intercept?

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,860
Well, if I'm somewhere along the
y-axis, what's my x value?

19
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,390
Well, I'm not to the right or
the left, so my x value has to

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,990
be 0, so the y-intercept occurs
when x is equal to 0.

21
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,680
So to figure out the intercepts,
let's set y equal

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,800
to 0 in this equation and solve
for x, and then let's

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,670
set x is equal to 0 and
then solve for y.

24
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,780
So when y is equal to 0, what
does this equation become?

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,900
I'll do it in orange.

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,710
You get negative 5x plus 4y.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,840
Well we're saying y is 0, so
4 times 0 is equal to 20.

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,000
4 times 0 is just 0, so we
can just not write that.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
So let me just rewrite it.

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,480
So we have negative
5x is equal to 20.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,740
We can divide both sides of this
equation by negative 5.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,780
The negative 5 cancel out,
that was the whole point

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,360
behind dividing by negative 5,
and we get x is equal to 20

34
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,970
divided by negative
5 is negative 4.

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,510
So when y is equal to 0, we
saw that right there, x is

36
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,920
equal to negative 5.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,685
Or if we wanted to plot that
point, we always put the x

38
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,050
coordinate first, so that
would be the point

39
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,650
negative 4 comma 0.

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,580
So let me graph that.

41
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,330
So if we go 1, 2, 3, 4.

42
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,950
That's a negative 4.

43
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,260
And then the y value is
just 0, so that point

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,130
is right over there.

45
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,270
That is the x-intercept, y
is 0, x is negative 4.

46
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,200
Notice we're intersecting
the x-axis.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,470
Now let's do the exact same
thing for the y-intercept.

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,015
Let's set x equal to 0, so if
we set x is equal to 0, we

49
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:54,830
have negative 5 times 0 plus
4y is equal to 20.

50
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,730
Well, anything times 0 is
0, so we can just put

51
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,560
that out of the way.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
And remember, this was setting
x is equal to 0, we're doing

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,290
the y-intercept now.

54
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,610
So this just simplifies
to 4y is equal to 20.

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,610
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 4 to get rid

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,730
of this 4 right there, and you
get y is equal to 20 over 4,

57
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,670
which is 5.

58
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,550
So when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 5.

59
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:25,410
So the point 0, 5 is on the
graph for this line.

60
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,840
So 0, 5.

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,550
x is 0 and y is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, right over there.

62
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,090
And notice, when x is 0, we're
right on the y-axis, this is

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,440
our y-intercept right
over there.

64
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,090
And if we graph the line, all
you need is two points to

65
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,120
graph any line, so we just have
to connect the dots and

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,160
that is our line.

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,700
So let me connect the dots,
trying my best to draw as

68
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,890
straight of a line is I can--
well, I can do a better job

69
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,860
than that-- to draw as straight
of a line as I can.

70
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,500
And that's the graph of this
equation using the x-intercept

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,920
and the y-intercept.
