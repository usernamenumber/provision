1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,790
Two videos ago we asked
ourselves if we could find the

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,150
basis for the columns
space of A.

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,440
And I showed you a method
of how to do it.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,580
You literally put A in reduced
row echelon form, so this

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,230
matrix R is just a reduced
row echelon form of A.

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,040
And you look at its
pivot columns, so

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,290
this is a pivot column.

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,880
It has a 1 and all 0's, this is
a pivot column, 1 and all

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,200
0's, and the 1 is the leading
non-zero term in its row.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,920
And this is a pivot column, let
me circle them, these guys

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,530
are pivot columns, and
this guy's a pivot

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,890
column right there.

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,200
You look at those in the reduced
row echelon form of

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,140
the matrix, and the
corresponding columns in the

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,870
original matrix will
be your basis.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,700
So this guy, this guy,
so the first,

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,420
second, and forth columns.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,730
So if we call this a1, this is
a2, and let's call this a4,

20
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,980
this would be a3,
and this is a5.

21
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:07,410
So we could say that a1, a2,
and a4 are a basis for the

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,020
column span of A.

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,500
And I didn't show you
why two videos ago.

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,960
I just said this is
how you do it.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,640
You have to take it as a bit
of an article of faith.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,970
Now in order for these
to be a basis, two

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,030
things have to be true.

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,770
They have to be linearly
independent, and I showed you

29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,130
in the very last video, the
second in our series dealing

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,830
with this vector.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,320
I showed you that by the fact
that this guy is r1, this guy

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,620
is r2, and this guy is r4, it's
clear that these guys are

33
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,630
linearly independent.

34
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,290
They each have a 1 in a unique
entry, and the rest of their

35
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,540
entries are 0.

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,420
   

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,510
We're looking at three pivot
columns right now, but it's

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,030
true if we had n
pivot columns.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,970
That each pivot column would
have a 1 in a unique place,

40
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,400
and all the other pivot
columns would

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,790
have 0 in that entry.

42
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,760
So there's no way that the
other pivot columns, any

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,150
linear combination of the other
ones, could never add up

44
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,200
to each of them.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,580
So these are definitely
linearly independent.

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,120
And I showed you in the last
video that if we know that

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,690
these are linearly independent,
we do know that

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,250
they are, given that R has the
same null space as A, we know

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,540
that these guys have to be
linearly independant, I did

50
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,230
that in the very last video.

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,060
Now the next requirement for a
basis, we checked this one

52
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:41,810
off, is to show that a1 a2 and
an, that their span equals the

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,750
column space of A.

54
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,680
Now the column space of A is
a span of all five of these

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,960
vectors, so I had to throw
a3 in there and a5.

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,060
So to show that just these three
vectors by themselves

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,130
span our column space, we just
have to show that I can

58
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,210
represent a3 and a5 as
linear combinations

59
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,950
of a1, a2, and a4.

60
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,160
If I can do that, then
I can say then

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,890
these guys are redundant.

62
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:25,140
Then the span of a1, a2, a3, a4,
and a5 doesn't need the a3

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,500
and the a5 terms, that we can
just reduce it to this.

64
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,790
Because these guys can be
represented as linear

65
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,630
combinations of the
other three.

66
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,340
These guys are redundant.

67
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,860
And if we can get rid of them
we can show that these guys

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,850
can be represented as linear
combinations of the other,

69
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,910
then we can get rid of them.

70
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,620
And then the span of these three
guys would be the same

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,160
as the span of these five guys,
which is of course the

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,350
definition of the column
space of A.

73
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,430
So let's see if we
can do that.

74
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,380
   

75
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,680
Let me fill in each of these
column vectors a1 through a5,

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,380
and then each of these column
vectors let me label them r1,

77
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,580
r2, r3, r4, and r5.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,790
Now let's explore the
null spaces again.

79
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,600
Or not even the null spaces,
let's just explore the

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,610
equations Ax is equal to -- let
me write it this way --

81
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:28,390
instead of x let me write x1,
x2, x3, x4, x5 is equal to 0.

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,050
   

83
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,650
This is how we define the
solution set of this.

84
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,870
All the potential x1's through
x5's or all the potential

85
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,480
vectors X right here, that
represents our null space.

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:50,490
And then also let's explore all
of the R times x1, x2, x3,

87
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,190
x4, x5's is equal to 0.

88
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,690
This is the 0 vector, in which
case you would have four

89
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,210
entries in this particular
case.

90
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,260
It would be a member of Rm.

91
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,690
So these equations
can be rewritten.

92
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,370
I can rewrite this as -- what
were the column vectors of A?

93
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,480
They were a1, a2 through a5.

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:18,090
So I can rewrite this as x1
times a1 plus x2 times a2 plus

95
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:25,750
x3 times a3 plus x4 times
a4 plus x5 times

96
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:34,070
a5 is equal to 0.

97
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,270
That was from our definition
of matrix vector

98
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,790
multiplication, this is just a
bunch of column vectors a1

99
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,250
through a5, I drew it up here.

100
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,870
I can just rewrite this
equation like this.

101
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,810
Similiarly, I can rewrite this
equation as the vector r1

102
00:05:51,810 --> 00:06:02,800
times x1 or x1 times r1 plus x2
times r2 plus x3 times r3

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,820
plus x4 times r4 plus x5
times r5 is equal to 0.

104
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,690
Now we know that when we put
this into reduced row echelon

105
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,000
form the x variables that are
associated with the pivot

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
columns are -- so what are the
x variables associated with

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
the pivot columns?

108
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,450
Well, the pivot columns
are r1, r2, and r4.

109
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,410
   

110
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,070
The x variables associated with
them, we can call them

111
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,850
pivot variables, and the ones
that are not associated with

112
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,710
our pivot columns are
free variables.

113
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,290
So the free variables
in this case, x3 and

114
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,145
x5, are free variables.

115
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:54,170
   

116
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,610
And that applies to A.

117
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,410
All of the vectors x that
satisfy this equation also

118
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,150
satisfy this equation,
and vice versa.

119
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,910
They're the exact same
null space, the exact

120
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,160
same solution set.

121
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,880
   

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,260
We can also call this x3 and
this x5 as free variables.

123
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,130
Now what does that mean?

124
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,710
We've done multiple
examples of this.

125
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,740
The free variables, you can set
them to anything you want.

126
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:31,270
So x3 in this case and x5 you
can set it to any real number.

127
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,010
You can set to anything
you want.

128
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,290
   

129
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,200
And then from this reduced row
echelon form we express the

130
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,340
other pivot variables as
functions of these guys.

131
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Maybe x1 is equal
to Ax3 plus Bx5.

132
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe x2 is equal
to Cx3 plus Dx5.

133
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,750
And maybe x4 is equal
to Ex3 plus Fx5.

134
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,220
   

135
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,530
That comes directly out of
literally multiplying this guy

136
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,010
times this equals 0, you'd get a
system of equations that you

137
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,740
could solve for your pivot
variables in terms of your

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,980
free variables.

139
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,390
Now given this, I want to show
you that you can always

140
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,450
construct one of your -- in
your original matrix.

141
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,220
So if we go to our original
matrix, you can always

142
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,059
construct one of the vectors
that are associated with the

143
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,260
free columns.

144
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,880
You can always construct one of
the free vectors using the

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,930
linear combination of the ones
that were associated with the

146
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,100
pivot columns before.

147
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,710
And how do I do that?

148
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,570
Well, let's say that I want to
find some linear combination

149
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,880
that gets me to this free
column, that gets me to a3.

150
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,810
So how could I do that?

151
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,330
Let me rearrange this
equation up here.

152
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,580
So what do I get?

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,970
   

154
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:08,210
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,360
That's x3 a3.

156
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,800
If I subtract x3 a3 from both
sides of the equation, I get

157
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:23,900
minus x3 a3 is equal to x1 a1
plus x2 a2 plus -- I don't

158
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:33,220
have the 3 there -- plus x4 a4
plus x5 -- sorry, x isn't a

159
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,720
vector-- x5 a5.

160
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,380
   

161
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,650
This, I guess salmon colored
statement here, is just

162
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,800
another rewriting of this
equation right here.

163
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,620
And all I did is I subtracted
this term right here, x3 a3,

164
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,900
from both sides of
the equation.

165
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,410
Now x3 is a free variable.

166
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,020
We can set it to anything
we want, and so is x5.

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,220
So let's set x3 is
equal to minus 1.

168
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,340
   

169
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,795
Then this term right here
becomes a 1, because that was

170
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:08,170
a minus x3.

171
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,060
And let's set x5 equal to 0.

172
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,990
   

173
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,750
So if x5 is equal 0, this term
disappears, and I did that

174
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
because x5 is a free variable.

175
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,300
I can set them to
anything I want.

176
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,960
Now I've written a3 as a linear
combination of, I guess

177
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,660
you could call it my potential
basis vectors right now, or

178
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,810
the vectors a1, a2, and a4.

179
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,130
They're the vectors in the
original matrix that were

180
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,850
associated with the
pivot columns.

181
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,070
Now in order to show that I can
always do this, we have to

182
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:49,790
show that for this combination
there's always some x1, x2,

183
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,660
and x4 that satisfy this.

184
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,260
Well, of course there's always
some x1, x2 that satisfy this,

185
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,400
we just have to substitute our
free variables, x3 is equal to

186
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,900
minus 3 and x5 is equal to 0,
into these equations that we

187
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,210
get from our system when we did
it with the reduced row

188
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,460
echelon form.

189
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,150
   

190
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,926
In this case you have x1 is
equal to minus A plus 0, x2 is

191
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:16,190
equal to minus C, so
on and so forth.

192
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,600
So you can always do that.

193
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,390
You can always express the
vectors that are associated

194
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,170
with the non-pivot columns as
linear combinations of the

195
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,230
vectors that are associated
with the pivot columns.

196
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,160
What I just did for a3, you
could just as easily have done

197
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,180
for a5 by subtracting
this term from both

198
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,270
sides of the equation.

199
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,260
Setting x5 to negative 1 and
setting x3 to 0 so that the 3

200
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,690
term disappears, and you could
run the same exact argument.

201
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,360
So given that, I've hopefully
shown you, or least helped you

202
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,240
see or made you comfortable
with the idea, that the

203
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,000
vectors -- let me do them in a
nice vibrant color -- these

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,480
magenta color vectors here that
are associated with the

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,940
free columns or with the free
variables, the free variables

206
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,520
were x3 and x5, those were these
columns right here, that

207
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,390
they can always be expressed as
linear combinations of the

208
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,150
other columns.

209
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,370
Because you just have to
manipulate this equation, set

210
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,940
the coefficient for whatever
you're trying to find a linear

211
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,950
combination for equal to minus
1, and set all the other free

212
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,620
variables equal to 0 that
you're not solving for.

213
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,010
And then you can get a linear
combination of the vectors

214
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,970
that are associated with
the pivot columns.

215
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,630
So given that, we've shown you
that these free vectors, and

216
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,570
I'm using my terminology very
loosely, that these ones that

217
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,560
are associated with the non
pivot columns can be expressed

218
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,300
as linear combinations
of these guys.

219
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,310
So they're unnecessary.

220
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,970
The span of this is equivalent
to the span of this, the span

221
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,030
of this is the column space of
A, so the span of this is the

222
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,390
column space of A.

223
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,250
So in the last video I showed
you that these guys are

224
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,860
linearly independent, and now
I've showed you that the span

225
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,020
of these guys is the
column space of A.

226
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,270
So now you should be satisfied
that these vectors that are

227
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,860
associated -- let me do it in
a blue color -- that that

228
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,800
column vector, this column
vector, and this column

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,260
vector, that are associated with
the pivot columns in the

230
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,520
reduced row echelon form of
the matrix, do indeed

231
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,160
represent a basis for the
column space of A.

232
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,090
Anyway, hopefully you didn't
find that too convoluted.

233
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,410
