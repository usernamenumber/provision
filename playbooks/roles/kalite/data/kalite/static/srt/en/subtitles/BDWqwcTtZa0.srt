1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,918
In this video we're going to talk about

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:06,815
the French, the French Revolution.

3
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:09,765
And what makes this especially significant is

4
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,423
that not only is this independence

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:15,758
from a monarchy-controlled empire,

6
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:18,242
like in the American Independence,

7
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:21,188
this is an actual overthrowing of a monarchy,

8
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,627
of a monarchy that controls a major world power.

9
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:27,712
So this is, on some level, depending on how you view it...

10
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:29,674
The American Revolution came first

11
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:32,882
and kind of put out the principles of self-governance

12
00:00:32,882 --> 00:00:34,844
and why do we need kings and all of that.

13
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:37,452
But the French Revolution was the first time

14
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:40,167
that those type of principles really took foot in Europe

15
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,236
and really overthrew a monarchy.

16
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:44,585
So just to understand kind of the environment

17
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,933
in which this began:

18
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:53,713
let's talk about what France was like in 1789,

19
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:57,413
which most people kind of view as the beginning of the Revolution.

20
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:03,963
One, France was poor. France-was-poor.

21
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,257
Now, you wouldn't think that France was poor

22
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:10,658
if you looked at Louis XVI, who was King of France,

23
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,650
If you looked at Louis XVI and the clothes he wore.

24
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:19,565
If you looked at Marie-Antoinette, his wife,

25
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,692
they don't look poor.

26
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,358
They lived in the palace of Versailles

27
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,979
which is ginormous.

28
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,758
It's this massive palace,

29
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:31,444
it would compare to the greatest palaces in the world.

30
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,845
They were living a lavish lifestyle.

31
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,806
Just in case you want to know where this is,

32
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:35,890
this is what's now almost a suburb of Paris.

33
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,120
But at the time it was a village

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,282
20 or 30 kilometers away from Paris.

35
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:43,030
So they don't seem to be poor.

36
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,545
But the actual government of France is poor.

37
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:48,421
And when I say poor, they're in debt.

38
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,558
They've just had two major military adventures.

39
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:59,652
One was the American Revolution.

40
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,711
They played a major part in supporting the revolutionaries.

41
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:05,716
Because they wanted to stick it to their enemy:

42
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:06,493
Great Britain.

43
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,800
They wanted their empire to shrink a little bit.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,712
So France sent significant military help and resources.

45
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:15,910
And you could imagine, that's not a cheap thing

46
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,200
when you're doing it across the Atlantic Ocean.

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,915
And, even before the American Revolution,

48
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:28,222
the Seven Years' War that ended in 1763,

49
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:30,620
this really drained the amount of wealth

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,953
that the French government had.

51
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,190
And for those of you who are more American history focused,

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,957
the Seven Years' War is really the same thing

53
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:39,737
as the French and Indian War.

54
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,405
The French and Indian War

55
00:02:41,405 --> 00:02:44,140
was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War.

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,980
But the Seven Years' War is the more general term.

57
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,085
Because there was also

58
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,591
a conflict going on in Europe simultaneously.

59
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:52,479
The French and Indian War was just part of that conflict.

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,013
And the Seven Years' actually engulfed

61
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:56,880
most of the powers of Europe at the time.

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,440
So France had participated in this, ended in 1763,

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,770
you had the American Revolution.

64
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,320
Both of these really just drained the amount of funds

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,730
that the government itself had.

66
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,325
At the same time, the French people were starving.

67
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:12,921
So people: people starving.

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,350
There was a generalized famine at the time.

69
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,496
They weren't producing enough grain,

70
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:18,690
people couldn't get their bread to eat.

71
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,842
So you can imagine,

72
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,671
when people are starving they're not happy.

73
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,616
And to kind of add insult to injury

74
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,350
you would see your royals living like this.

75
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,899
But even worse than the royals,

76
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,610
who you don't see every day, you saw your nobility.

77
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,990
Who is roughly a little over 1.5% of the population.

78
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:45,596
But you saw the nobility really, really, living it up.

79
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,563
And the nobility, just so you know,

80
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,959
these are people with fancy titles who inherit land

81
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,079
and wealth from generation to generation.

82
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,840
They don't dress too differently from the King.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,135
And they essentially live in smaller versions of the Palace of Versailles.

84
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:01,693
And if you're a peasant, you work on their fields,

85
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:04,540
do all the work, you send them some of your crops

86
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,805
and they pay no taxes.

87
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,358
So from your point of view,

88
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,292
and it's not hard to understand why you would think this,

89
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,563
these are essentially kind of parasites

90
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:15,722
who are completely ignoring the fact that you are starving

91
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,747
and you're paying all the taxes.

92
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,550
You can imagine people weren't too happy about that.

93
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,080
And then to top it all off,

94
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,681
you had all of these philosophers hanging around,

95
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:30,469
talking about the Enlightenment.

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,140
And this is kind of the whole movement where people,

97
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,340
and authors, and poets, and philosophers,

98
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,150
are starting to realize that, gee, maybe we don't need kings.

99
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,795
Maybe we don't need priests to tell us

100
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:45,560
what it means to be good or bad.

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,420
Maybe people could essentially rule

102
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,830
themselves all of a sudden.

103
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,620
And obviously, the biggest proof of the Enlightenment

104
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,520
was the American Revolution.

105
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,980
That was kind of the first example of people rising up

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,960
and saying, we don't need these kings anymore.

107
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,460
We want to govern ourselves.

108
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,080
For the people, by the people.

109
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,812
You also had kind of this philosophical movement going around.

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,480
Now if you ask me my opinion of what the biggest thing was,

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,810
I think the people starving. You can never underestimate

112
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,077
what people are willing to do when they're actually hungry.

113
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,409
And, this is kind of more from the intellectual point of view.

114
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,730
People said, oh there's Enlightenment movement here.

115
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,270
So this is the state of France.

116
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,980
They had a financial crisis.

117
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,660
So a meeting was called,

118
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,745
kind of an emergency meeting of the major groups of France

119
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:35,681
to try to resolve some of these problems.

120
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,109
It's a fiscal crisis, people are starving, what do you do?

121
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:42,217
So they called the Convocation of the Estates-General.

122
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,033
Let me write that down.

123
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:54,964
Convocation of the Estates-General

124
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:58,157
Which was a meeting of the three Estates of France.

125
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,440
Now what are the three Estates of France?

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,210
You can really just view them as the three major social

127
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,120
classes of France.

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,690
The First Estate was the clergy.

129
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:16,790
The Second Estate is the nobility.

130
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,516
And then the Third Estate is everyone else.

131
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:27,152
Is everyone else.. In a different color. Everyone else.

132
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:29,756
This gives you a sense of how skewed the power structure.

133
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:32,457
Because people kind of grouped the power as OK:

134
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:33,535
these are the three groups

135
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:34,889
and maybe they can vote against each other.

136
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,570
But this was only 0.5% of the population, this is 1.5% of

137
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,225
the population, this was 98% of the population.

138
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,330
But these people had equal weight with these guys.

139
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,890
But these people had the burden of most of the taxes.

140
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,050
These are the people who are doing all the work,

141
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,650
producing all of France's wealth, dying in the wars.

142
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,431
But these guys, despite their small population,

143
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:03,350
have more weight than everybody else.

144
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,760
So you had the Convocation of the Estates-General,

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,265
where representatives of these Three Estates met,

146
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:11,847
at the Palace of Versailles,

147
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:14,878
to essentially figure out what to do about this fiscal crisis.

148
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:18,160
Now obviously, these people right here, the Third Estate,

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,970
they were angry.

150
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,910
They were like look, we've taken the burden on ourselves

151
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,900
for much of the recent history of France.

152
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,884
We're tired of you guys getting away with not paying taxes

153
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:30,230
and just kind of leeching off of us.

154
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,199
They were afraid that even more of the tax burden

155
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,145
was going to be put on them.

156
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:37,970
And the nobility, or the King, or the clergy,

157
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,502
that they wouldn't have to make sacrifices.

158
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:42,280
So they came in already angry.

159
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,754
And so they really wanted to meet in one big room together.

160
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:47,460
Because they actually had roughly 600 representatives.

161
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Which only the King at the last minute agreed to.

162
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,770
Before, it was only going to be equal numbers of them.

163
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,090
These guys had 300 roughly.

164
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,550
These guys had 300 as well.

165
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,580
These guys were able to say: hey we're 98% of the population

166
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,555
maybe we should have at least 600 representatives.

167
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,050
But even there, they wanted to meet in the same room.

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,561
And essentially try to make it so it's

169
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:06,410
one representative, one vote.

170
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,918
But obviously these other Estates, the clergy

171
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,140
and the nobility, said no, let's each vote as Estates.

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,200
And at the end of the day, these guys lost.

173
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,239
So they were essentially forced to kind of organize

174
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,032
independently as a Third Estate.

175
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,020
So that made them even angrier.

176
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,490
So they met at an assembly hall and said: you know what,

177
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,960
if these guys are going to ignore us,

178
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,210
not only are we going to be in this room

179
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,720
and start organizing ourselves.

180
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,325
But we're not going to call this the Convocation of the Estates-General.

181
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,289
We're going to declare that we are the

182
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,698
National Assembly of France.

183
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:45,785
The National Assembly of France.

184
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:46,950
That we represent the people.

185
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,600
We are essentially going to become the

186
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,988
parliamentary body of France.

187
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,602
Instead of just being this emergency

188
00:08:52,602 --> 00:08:54,500
Convocation of the Estates-General.

189
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,750
And they actually got some sympathy from some elements of

190
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,970
the clergy and some elements of the nobility.

191
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,590
Now obviously, Louis XVI was not amused by this

192
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,620
whole turn of events.

193
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,180
Here he was, he was an absolute monarch, which means

194
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,892
that he held pretty much all of the power

195
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:14,130
to do whatever he saw was fit.

196
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,658
And all of a sudden you had this group of upstarts

197
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:17,895
you know they are taking advantage

198
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,485
of this emergency situation where he can't

199
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:23,182
continue to buy as many silk robes as he was before.

200
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,871
They're taking advantage of the situation to declare

201
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,600
a National Assembly of France.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,880
To declare somehow that I'm not an absolute monarch.

203
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,580
That my power is going to be taken by this assembly.

204
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,310
So he wasn't happy.

205
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,364
So when they took a break,

206
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:36,820
he locked the door of the assembly room.

207
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,520
So they couldn't get in.

208
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,690
And he said, oh I think there needs to be some repairs

209
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,350
in that room.

210
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,660
Maybe you all can assemble later.

211
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,730
And that was kind of his way of saying NO.

212
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,219
If you're declaring you're the National Assembly of France,

213
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,230
I'm not going to even let you assemble.

214
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,510
I'm not even going to let you get in the room.

215
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,278
So that clearly didn't do a lot to make these guys

216
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,510
or in particular these guys, any happier.

217
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,640
People are hungry.

218
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,950
These people are living lavishly.

219
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,900
They've already been not allowed

220
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,310
to vote in one room together.

221
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:09,023
When they vote in their own room, and declare themselves

222
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,792
as representatives of the people of France,

223
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,179
which they really are,

224
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,350
the King locks the room, doesn't let them go in.

225
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,030
So they go to an indoor tennis court in Versailles.

226
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,220
This is a picture of it right here.

227
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,157
This is an indoor tennis court.

228
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,310
And that gives you an idea of how lavish Versailles was,

229
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,050
that it had an indoor tennis court in the late 1700s.

230
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,575
And they proclaimed the Tennis Court Oath.

231
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:41,952
Tennis Court Oath.

232
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:43,740
Where they proclaimed:

233
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,868
not are we only the National Assembly of France

234
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,430
but even more than that, we all pledge to not stop

235
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,127
until we create a constitution of France.

236
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,979
A constitution of France.

237
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,570
So they went from being a National Assembly to

238
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,820
essentially morphing into a constituent assembly.

239
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,208
We're going to create a constitution.

240
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:16,102
Constitution for France.

241
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:19,230
And they had sympathy from some elements of the clergy

242
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,340
and the nobility.

243
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,710
So eventually Louis XVI, he kind of saw the writing

244
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,380
on the wall. He didn't like the..you know.

245
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,690
The people are angry.

246
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,550
And every time he tries to mess with them,

247
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,770
they only get angrier.

248
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,920
And they only go to even more extreme measures.

249
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,355
So just to kind of make it seem like he's going along,

250
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,900
he says: "ok that's cool, guys.

251
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,620
Whatever you all want to do.

252
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,850
Yeah, maybe I'm open to it, we are in an emergency.

253
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,966
And maybe it is unreasonable,

254
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,082
I have been a little bit unreasonable."

255
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,760
So he lets them be, he lets them assemble again.

256
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,070
But while that's happening, people start to notice that

257
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,612
troops are converging on Paris.

258
00:11:52,612 --> 00:12:05,690
Troops converging on Paris.

259
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,260
And they're obviously being sent there by the King.

260
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,355
And not only are they just any troops, a lot of the actual troops

261
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,870
even though they are French troops, they're under the

262
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,330
authority of France's military.

263
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,260
They're actually foreign troops.

264
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,050
So, if you think about it, these would be the ideal types

265
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,713
of troops to put down any type of insurgency,

266
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:25,720
or any type of rebellion.

267
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,430
Or even better, to go in and dissolve

268
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,230
the National Assembly.

269
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,760
So people start getting a little bit paranoid,

270
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,290
you can imagine.

271
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:38,050
Now on top of that, Louis XVI's main financial advisor,

272
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,786
Necker, Jacques Necker.

273
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:45,680
He was sympathetic to the Third Estate,

274
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,275
to the plight of the Third Estate.

275
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:55,770
And he said: "hey Mr. King, I think it's reasonable for you

276
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,170
to essentially budget your expenses a little bit better.

277
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,630
And maybe a little bit less of a lavish lifestyle.

278
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,070
Considering the state of the government's budget.

279
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,330
And the state of the people of France, they're starving.

280
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,510
Why don't you do that a little bit?"

281
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:14,148
But Louis XVI, instead of taking his advice, he fired him.

282
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:16,277
He fired the financial advisor.

283
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:22,704
Fired advisor.

284
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:24,402
So taken together, troops are converging on Paris,

285
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:26,100
you have this Tennis Court Oath,

286
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,020
Louis XVI has fired his advisor,

287
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,760
people are going hungry.

288
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,070
They're genuinely going hungry.

289
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,560
People in Paris said: "you know what?

290
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,697
The King is going to try to suppress us again

291
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,300
this is no good.

292
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,540
And especially if he does it with troops,

293
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,520
we have to arm ourselves."

294
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,070
So they stormed the Bastille.

295
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,220
This right here is a picture of the Bastille.

296
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,715
This is the Bastille.

297
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:57,102
And this is most famous, when you when you first learn about it

298
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,630
or maybe this is the first time you're learning about it.

299
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,433
They put political prisoners there

300
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,700
and they freed the political prisoners.

301
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,280
But in reality, there were only seven prisoners

302
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,400
in the Bastille.

303
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,008
So it's not like thousands and thousands of

304
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,580
political prisoners were being held there and there were freed.

305
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,919
The real value of the Bastille to the revolutionaries,

306
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,150
we could say, is that there were weapons there.

307
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,440
There was a major arms cache there.

308
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,750
And so by storming the Bastille and getting the weapons,

309
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,174
they all of a sudden could essentially fend off

310
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:28,390
any type of threat that the troops would have.

311
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,970
But this is also kind of the very beginning of the real

312
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,436
chaos of the French Revolution.

313
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,243
And as we're going to see over the next several years

314
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:36,750
the chaos only gets worse and worse.

315
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,409
It's almost, on a lot of levels,

316
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,069
a lot worse than the American Revolution.

317
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,962
Because what actually happened in the cities and

318
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,876
what fellow Frenchman started doing to do each other

319
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,115
was really, on many levels, barbaric.

320
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:48,730
And you actually saw it here for the first time,

321
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,190
where the governor of the Bastille, the guy who was in charge of it,

322
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,670
he had the standoff between the troops.

323
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,350
And he eventually called for a ceasefire.

324
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,050
Because he's like, oh there's too much bloodshed.

325
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,790
But once the revolutionaries got to him, they stabbed them,

326
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,110
they cut his head off, and they put it on a pike.

327
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,440
Then they went back to the Mayor of Paris, they shot him.

328
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
So clearly, things were really getting out of hand.

329
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,130
But most people associate the storming of the Bastille as

330
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,640
kind of the landmark event of the French Revolution.

331
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,650
Even today, people celebrate Bastille Day.

332
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:26,670
And that is July 14, 1789.

333
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,044
So just to give you a sense of how quickly all of this

334
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:32,504
happened, the Convocation of the Estates-General

335
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,570
that was in May.

336
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,580
The Tennis Court Oath was in June.

337
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,800
And then in July, you have the storming of the Bastille.

338
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,277
And then in August, just to kind of complete the idea that

339
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,855
we are definitely in a revolutionary period.

340
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,757
In August, the National Assembly,

341
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:54,887
that started off at the tennis courts with the Third Estate,

342
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,775
they declared their equivalent of the Declaration of Independence.

343
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:06,283
They declared their Declaration

344
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:22,846
of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

345
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,188
Which was essentially their version

346
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,978
of the Declaration of Independence.

347
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:28,750
And it essentially put everything into question of

348
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,149
what is life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?

349
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,820
I'm using words from the American Revolution.

350
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,380
But this was their Declaration of Independence.

351
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,567
It wasn't a constitution, it was just a statement

352
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,410
of the things that they think need to govern

353
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,190
any type of constitution or country.

354
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,400
Or the ideas that any country should be based on.

355
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,590
So I'm going to leave you there.

356
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,390
We've really now started the French Revolution.

357
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,182
And now, you're going to see that over the next several years

358
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:56,165
it's only going to get bloodier and bloodier

359
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,520
and even more complex.

360
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,964
And when everything is said and done,

361
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:01,548
it's actually not going to end that well

362
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,132
in terms of giving people Liberty.
