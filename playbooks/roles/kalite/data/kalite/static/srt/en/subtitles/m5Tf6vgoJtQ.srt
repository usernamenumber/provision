1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,910
Let's do a couple of word
problems dealing with

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,940
exponential growth and decay.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,930
So this first problem, suppose a
radioactive substance decays

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,130
at a rate of 3.5% per hour.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,400
What percent of the substance
is left after 6 hours?

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,970
So let's make a little table
here, to just imagine

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,700
what's going on.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,940
And then we'll try to come
up with a formula for, in

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,210
general, how much is
left after n hours.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,980
So let's say hours that
have passed by,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,240
and percentage left.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,270
   

14
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,880
So after 0 hours, what
percent is left?

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,710
Well, it hasn't decayed yet,
so we have 100% left.

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,570
After 1 hour, what's happened?

17
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,200
It decays at a rate
of 3.5% per hour.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,140
So 3.5% is gone.

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,220
Or another way to think
about it is 0.965.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,860
Remember, if you take 1 minus
3.5%, or if you take 100%

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,390
minus 3.5%-- this is how much
we're losing every hour-- that

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,360
equals 96.5%.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,360
So each hour we're going
to have 96.5% of

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720
the previous hour.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,840
So in hour 1, we're going to
have 96.5% of hour 0, or 0.965

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,970
times 100, times hour 0.

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,325
Now, what happens in hour 2?

28
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,850
   

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,540
Well, we're going to have 96.5%
of the previous hour.

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,120
We will have lost 3.5%, which
means that we have 96.5% of

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,190
the previous hour.

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:59,870
So it'll be 0.965 times this,
times 0.965 times 100.

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,660
I think you see where this
is going, in general.

34
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,510
So in the first hour, we
have 0.965 to the first

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,780
power, times 100.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,759
In the zeroth hour, we have
0.965 to the zeroth power.

37
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,730
We don't see it, but there's
a 1 there, times 100.

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,110
In the second hour, 0.965 to the
second power, times 100.

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,040
So in general, in the nth hour--
let me do this in a

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,860
nice bold color-- in the nth
hour, we're going to have

41
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,850
0.965 to the nth power,
times 100 left of

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,130
our radioactive substance.

43
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,100
And oftentimes you'll see
it written this way.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,380
You have your initial amount
times your common ratio, 0.965

45
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,450
to the nth power.

46
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,500
This is how much you're going
to have left after n hours.

47
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,820
Well, now we can answer
the question.

48
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,310
After 6 hours how much are
we going to have left?

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,860
Well, we're going to have
100 times 0.965 to

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,520
the sixth power left.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,150
And we could use a calculator
to figure out what that is.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's use our trusty
calculator.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,880
So we have 100 times 0.965 to
the sixth power, which is

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,820
equal to 80.75.

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,080
This is all in percentages.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,220
So it's 80.75% of our
original substance.

57
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,600
   

58
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,646
Let's do another one of these.

59
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:41,570
So we have, Nadia owns a chain
of fast food restaurants that

60
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:48,360
operated 200 stores in 1999.

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,500
If the rate of increase is--
oh actually, there's a typo

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,670
here, it should be 8%-- the
rate of increase is 8%

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,760
annually, how many
stores does the

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,450
restaurant operate in 2007?

65
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,400
So let's think about
the same thing.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,860
So let's say years after 1999.

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,019
And let's talk about how many
stores Nadia is operating, her

68
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,820
fast food chain.

69
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,950
So 1999 itself is 0
years after 1999.

70
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,710
And she is operating
200 stores.

71
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,620
Then in 2000, which is 1 year
after 1999, how many is she

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,040
going to be operating?

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,190
Well, she grows at the
rate of 8% annually.

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,060
So she'll be operating all the
stores that she had before

75
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,210
plus 8% of the store
she had before.

76
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,980
So 1.08 times the number of
stores she had before.

77
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,660
And you're going to see, the
common ratio here is 1.08.

78
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,380
If you're growing by 8%,
that's equivalent to

79
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,460
multiplying by 1.08.

80
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,740
Let me make that clear.

81
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,290
200 plus 0.08, times 200.

82
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, this is just 1 times
200 plus 0.08, times 200.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,700
That's 1.08 times 200.

84
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,920
Then in 2001, what's going on?

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,310
This is now 2 years after 1999,
and you're going to grow

86
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,230
8% from this number.

87
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,330
You're going to multiply
1.08 times that number,

88
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,510
times 1.08 times 200.

89
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,060
I think you get the general
gist. If, after n years after

90
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,550
1999, it's going to be 1.08--
let me write it this way.

91
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,660
It's going to be 200 times
1.08 to the nth power.

92
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,200
After 2 years, 1.08 squared.

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,370
1 year, 1.08 to the
first power.

94
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,960
0 years, this is the same thing
as a 1 times 200, which

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,870
is 1.08 to the zeroth power.

96
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,620
So they're asking us, how many
stores does the restaurant

97
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,550
operate in 2007?

98
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, 2007 is 8 years
after 1999.

99
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,090
So here n is equal to 8.

100
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,110
So let us substitute
n is equal to 8.

101
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,180
The answer to our question will
be 200 times 1.08 to the

102
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,410
eighth power.

103
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's get our calculator
out and calculate it.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,570
So we want to figure
out 200 times 1.08

105
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,090
to the eighth power.

106
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,840
She's going to be operating 370
restaurants, and she'll be

107
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,250
in the process of opening
a few more.

108
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,050
So if we round it down, she's
going to be operating 370

109
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,900
restaurants.

110
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,255
So 8% growth might not look like
something that's so fast

111
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:04,910
or that exciting.

112
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,430
But in under a decade, in only 8
years, she would have gotten

113
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,390
her restaurant chain from
200 to 370 restaurants.

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,020
So over 8 years, you see that
the compounding growth by 8%

115
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,440
actually ends up being
quite dramatic.

116
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,000
