1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's say we have the following
second order

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,680
differential equation.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,860
We have second derivative of
y, plus 4 times the first

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,590
derivative, plus 4y
is equal to 0.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,330
And we're asked to find the
general solution to this

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,280
differential equation.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,250
So the first thing we do, like
we've done in the last several

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,940
videos, we'll get the
characteristic equation.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,590
That's r squared plus 4r
plus 4 is equal to 0.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,830
This one is fairly
easy to factor.

12
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,570
We don't need the quadratic
equation here.

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,680
This is r plus 2
times r plus 2.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,020
And now something interesting
happens, something that we

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,830
haven't seen before.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,150
The two roots of our
characteristic equation are

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,150
actually the same number,
r is equal to minus 2.

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,980
So you could say we only have
one solution, or one root, or

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,000
a repeated root.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,560
However you want to say it, we
only have one r that satisfies

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,690
the characteristic equation.

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,450
You might say, well
that's fine.

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,280
Maybe my general solution is
just y is equal to some

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,420
constant times e to the minus
2x, using my one solution.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,040
And my reply to you is,
this is a solution.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,390
And if you don't believe
me you can test it out.

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,860
But it's not the general
solution.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,810
And why do I say that?

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,610
Because this is a second order
differential equation.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,690
And if someone wanted a
particular solution, they

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,810
would have to give you two
initial conditions.

32
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,020
The two initial conditions we've
been using so far are,

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:42,860
what y of 0 equals, and what
y prime of 0 equals.

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,530
They could give you what y
of 5 equals, who knows.

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,640
But in general, when you have
a second order differential

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,790
equation, they have to give you
two initial conditions.

37
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,830
Now the problem with this
solution, and why it's not the

38
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,960
general solution, is if you
use one of these initial

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,400
conditions, you can solve
for a c, right?

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,110
You'll get an answer.

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,470
You'll solve for that c.

42
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,650
But then there's nothing
to do with the

43
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,880
second initial condition.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,300
In fact, except for only in one
particular case, whatever

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,930
c you get for the first initial
condition, it won't be

46
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,240
that-- this equation won't
be true for the

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
second initial condition.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
And you could try it out.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,340
I mean, if we said, y of 0 is
equal to A and y prime of 0 is

50
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,730
equal to 5A.

51
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,950
Let's see if these work.

52
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,450
If y of 0 is equal to A, that
tells us that A is equal to c

53
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,010
times e to the minus
2 times 0.

54
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,590
So e to the 0.

55
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,740
Or c is equal to A, right?

56
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,790
So if you just had this first
initial condition, say fine,

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,520
my particular solution is
y is equal to A times e

58
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,510
to the minus 2x.

59
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,640
Let's see if this particular
solution satisfies the second

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,720
initial condition.

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,410
So what is the derivative
of this?

62
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,750
y prime is equal to minus
2Ae to the minus 2x.

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,420
And it says that 5A-- this
initial condition says that 5A

64
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,960
is equal to minus 2A times
e to the minus 2 times

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,690
0, so e to the 0.

66
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,100
Or another way of saying that,
e to the 0 is just 1.

67
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,150
It says that 5A is equal
to minus 2A, which

68
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,050
we know is not true.

69
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,800
So note, when we only have
this general, or

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,580
pseudo-general, solution, it can
only satisfy, generally,

71
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,730
one of the initial conditions.

72
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,560
And if we're really lucky,
both initial conditions.

73
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,060
So that at least gives you an
intuitive feel of why this

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,145
isn't the general solution.

75
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:44,820
So let me clean that up a little
bit so that I-- I have

76
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,020
a feeling I'll have to
use this real estate.

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,270
So what do we do?

78
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,280
We can use a technique called
reduction of order.

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,630
And it really just says,
well let's just

80
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,790
guess a second solution.

81
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,340
In general when we first thought
about these linear

82
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,940
constant coefficient
differential equations, we

83
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,840
said, well e to rx might
be a good guess.

84
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,530
And why is that?

85
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,650
Because all of the derivatives
of e are kind of multiples of

86
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,010
the original function, and
that's why we used it.

87
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,450
So if we're looking for a second
solution, it doesn't

88
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,079
hurt to kind of make
the same guess.

89
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,149
And in order be a little bit
more general, let's make our

90
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:23,830
guess for our second solution--
I'll call this g

91
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:31,700
for guess-- let's say it's some
function of x times our

92
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,450
first solution, e
to the minus 2x.

93
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,590
I could say some function of x
times c times e to the minus

94
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,280
2x, but the c is kind
of encapsulated.

95
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,150
It could be part of this some
random function of x.

96
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,880
So let's be as general
as possible.

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,380
So let's assume that this is a
solution and then substitute

98
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,680
it back into our original
differential equation, and see

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,010
if we can actually solve for
v that makes it all work.

100
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,700
So before we do that, let's
get its first and second

101
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,710
derivatives.

102
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,540
So the first derivative of g
is equal to-- well this is

103
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,790
product rule.

104
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,570
And I'll drop the v of x, we
know that v is a function and

105
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,920
not a constant.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,250
So, product rule, derivative
of the first, v prime times

107
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,690
the second expression, e to the
minus 2x, plus the first

108
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,870
function, or expression, times
the derivative of the second.

109
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,890
So minus 2 times e
to the minus 2x.

110
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,630
   

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,190
Or, just to write it a little
bit neater, g prime is equal

112
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:46,150
to v prime e to the minus 2x
minus 2ve to the minus 2x.

113
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,570
Now we have to get the
second derivative.

114
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,610
I'll do it in a different
color, just to fight the

115
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,220
monotony of it.

116
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,780
So the second derivative-- we're
going to have to do the

117
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,770
product rule twice-- derivative
of this first

118
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,380
expression.

119
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:07,260
It's going to be v prime prime
e to the minus 2x, minus 2v

120
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,390
prime e to the minus 2x.

121
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,400
That was just the product
rule again.

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,060
And then the derivative of the
second expression is going to

123
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,330
be-- let's see, derivative of
the first one is v prime-- so

124
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:31,770
it's going to be minus 2v prime
e to the minus 2x, plus

125
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,030
4ve to the minus 2x.

126
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,340
I hope I haven't made
a careless mistake.

127
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,010
And we can simplify
this a little bit.

128
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,750
So we get the second derivative
of g, which is our

129
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,350
guess solution, is equal to
the second derivative of v

130
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:58,130
prime, e to the minus 2x minus
2v prime-- no, minus 4, sorry,

131
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,570
because we have minus 2, minus
2-- minus 4v prime e to the

132
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:10,710
minus 2x, plus 4ve
to the minus 2x.

133
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,120
And now, before we substitute it
into this, we can just make

134
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,910
one observation.

135
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,840
That will just make the algebra
a little bit simpler.

136
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,530
Notice that g is something
times e to the minus 2x.

137
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,940
G prime is-- we could factor
out an e to the minus 2x.

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,740
And g prime prime, we
can factor out an e

139
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,260
to the minus 2x.

140
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,740
So let's factor them
out, essentially.

141
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,150
So when we write this, we can
write-- so the second

142
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,640
derivative is g prime prime,
which we can write as-- and

143
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,830
I'm going to try to do this--
it's e to the minus 2x times

144
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,690
the second derivative.

145
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,610
So now we can get rid of the
e to the minus 2x terms. So

146
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:00,580
that's v prime prime minus
4v prime plus 4v, right?

147
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,130
If I just distribute this out
I get the second derivative,

148
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,820
which is this.

149
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,220
Plus 4 times the first
derivative.

150
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,190
And I'm also going to factor
out the e to the minus 2x.

151
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,580
So, plus 4 times this.

152
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,610
So it's going to be plus 4v
prime minus 8v, right?

153
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,490
   

154
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,740
Once again, I factored out the
e to the minus 2x, right?

155
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,050
Plus 4 times y.

156
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,990
   

157
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,110
We factored out the e to the
minus 2x-- so plus 4 times v.

158
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,070
I did that, because if I didn't
do that I'd be writing

159
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,140
e to the minus 2x, and I'd
probably make a careless

160
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,370
mistake, and I'd run out
of space, et cetera.

161
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,840
But anyway, I essentially-- to
get this, I just substituted

162
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,350
the second derivative, the first
derivative, and g back

163
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,710
into the differential
equation.

164
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,530
And we know that that
has to equal 0.

165
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,010
And let's see if we
can simplify this

166
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,910
a little bit more.

167
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,700
And then hopefully
solve for v.

168
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,800
So let's see, some things
are popping out at me.

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,380
So I have plus 4v plus
4v, that's plus

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,090
8v, minus 8v, right?

171
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,740
So plus 4 minus 8 plus
4, those cancel out.

172
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,490
It's plus 8 minus 8,
those cancel out.

173
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,600
And I also have minus 4v
prime plus 4v prime.

174
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,500
So those cancel out.

175
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,280
And lo and behold, we've done
some serious simplification.

176
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,840
It ends up being e to the minus
2x times v prime prime--

177
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,020
we could call that v prime prime
of x, now that we've

178
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,170
saved so much space--
is equal to 0.

179
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,870
We know this could
never equal to 0.

180
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,420
So, essentially, we have now
established that this

181
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,120
expression has to
be equal to 0.

182
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,590
And we get a separable second
order differential equation.

183
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,585
We get that the second
derivative of v with respect

184
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:55,590
to x-- or it's a function
of x-- is equal to 0.

185
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,660
So now we just have to
differentiate both sides of

186
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,500
this equation twice.

187
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,900
You differentiate once,
you get what?

188
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:10,830
v prime of x is equal to,
let's call it c1.

189
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,770
And if we were to take the
anti-derivative of both sides

190
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:23,330
again, we get v of x is
equal to c1 x plus

191
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,940
some other c2, right?

192
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Now remember, what
was our guess?

193
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,990
Our guess was that our general
solution was going to be some

194
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,840
arbitrary function v times that
first solution we found,

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,160
e to the minus 2x.

196
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,310
And when we actually took that
guess and we substituted it

197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,960
in, we actually were able
to solve for that v.

198
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,020
And we got that v is
equal to this.

199
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,350
So this is interesting.

200
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,000
So what is g, or what does
our guess function equal?

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,850
And it's no longer a guess.

202
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,540
We've kind of established
that it works.

203
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,520
g, which we can call our
solution, is equal to v of x,

204
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,840
times e to the minus 2x.

205
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:15,240
Well, that equals this, c1 x
plus c2 e to the minus 2x.

206
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:25,180
That equals c1 xe to the minus
2x, plus c2 e to the minus 2x.

207
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,660
And now we have a truly
general solution.

208
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,240
We have two constants, so we
can satisfy two initial

209
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,260
conditions.

210
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,560
And if you were looking for a
pattern, this is the pattern.

211
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,950
When you have a repeated root
of your characteristic

212
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,250
equation, the general solution
is going to be-- you're going

213
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,390
to use that e to the, that
whatever root is, twice.

214
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,580
But one time you're going to
have an x in front of it.

215
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,300
And this works every time for
second order homogeneous

216
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,700
constant coefficient
linear equations.

217
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,140
I will see you in
the next video.

218
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,500
