1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,660
What I want to do in this video
is one, just do a bunch of

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,077
addition examples so that we
really get some good practice

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,368
and we really get warmed
up with addition.

4
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:12,930
And what I even more want to
show you is that we now have

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,080
all the tools we need to really
tackle any addition problem.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,570
So let's just get warmed up
with some one-digit addition

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,780
problems, but these are the
ones that always give me a

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,850
little bit of a headache.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,997
Let's start with a really,
relatively straightforward one.

10
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:29,749
I want to say two plus four.

11
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:30,449
Well, we know what that is.

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,860
I don't think we need to draw
the number line at this

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,340
point, but you can if you
need to remember this.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,210
Two plus four is six.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,420
Not too bad.

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,020
What about nine plus three?

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,000
We saw that in the last video.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,670
Nine plus one is ten.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,250
Plus another one is eleven.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,600
Plus three is twelve.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,890
Nine plus three is twelve.

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,600
And it's probably
not a bad idea.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,880
It's good to visualize what's
happening here, but it's also

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,380
not a bad idea to be able
to do these very fast.

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,500
To be able to memorize, at
least what the one-digit

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,990
addition problems end up being.

27
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,640
Let's do a couple
of harder ones.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,250
Six plus seven.

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,130
This one I used to find
difficult to remember.

30
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,920
But six plus seven is thirteen.

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,250
Draw out the number lines
and the lemons and limes

32
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,620
if you don't believe me.

33
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,670
Six plus seven is thirteen.

34
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,640
Eight plus six or six plus eight
is going to be fourteen.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,650
And that's the same
thing as seven plus seven -- is

36
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,460
also going to be fourteen.

37
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,370
And if you think about
it, we got the same

38
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,370
number here as there.

39
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,150
And it makes sense, right?

40
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,260
Because we took one away from
eight, but we had one more than six.

41
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,040
So it's like you just shifted
the one from the eight to the six.

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,350
That's why we got
the same answer.

43
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,500
If that confused
you, ignore it.

44
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's just do a couple
of more of these.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,870
So eight plus eight is sixteen.

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,920
These are things that hopefully
you'll be able to do super fast

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,700
in the not too far off future.

48
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,680
Five plus six.

49
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,950
Well, that's eleven.

50
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me just do a couple
of more really fast.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,200
So let's say seven plus nine
is going to be sxiteen.

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,550
You might want to draw
the number line if

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,180
you don't believe me.

54
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,630
And that's going to be the same
thing as eight plus eight, is also sixteen.

55
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,590
And then nine plus nine is eighteen.

56
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,440
And then nine plus eight is seventeen.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,800
And that's just a
little bit of warm up.

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,090
We didn't do all of the
possible combinations of

59
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,400
one-digit numbers, but these
are some of the ones that

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,500
give people a little
bit more headache.

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,050
So now that we've done that
let's tackle some larger digit

62
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,630
numbers that we started
doing in the previous video.

63
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,060
Maybe I'll leave
that there for now.

64
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,090
So let's do a couple of them.

65
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,962
Let's do twenty-two plus three.

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,750
So we go to the ones place.

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,770
Two plus three is five.

68
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,400
We didn't have to
carry anything.

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,380
And then in the tens place we
just have this two sitting here.

70
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
So we just take that two.

71
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,240
Two plus nothing -- it's two tens.

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,650
It's two dimes.

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,810
So then we put that down there.

74
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,491
So we get twenty-five.

75
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,580
Two dimes and five pennies, or twenty-five cents
depending -- a lot of people,

76
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,330
money makes it easier to
understand things or maybe

77
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,930
to be motivated to
understand things.

78
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,560
All right, let's
do another one.

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:28,468
What is thirty-eight plus seventeen?

80
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,770
So we look at just
the ones place.

81
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,460
What is eight plus seven?

82
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,660
We haven't done that one
yet; I'll do it up here.

83
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,110
Eight plus seven is equal to--
it's going to be one

84
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,098
more than eight plus six.

85
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,580
Eight plus six is fourteen, then eight
plus seven is going to be

86
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,330
one more than that.

87
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,020
So it's going to
be equal to fifteen.

88
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,090
So in this problem we
write the five here.

89
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,810
Let me write this in
a different color.

90
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,550
So the five in the fifteen we'd
write right down there

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,650
in the ones place.

92
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,430
And we would carry the one
because that's one dime.

93
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,560
That's one ten.

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,840
You know, this fifteen,
this is ten plus five.

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,960
So this one really means
one ten or one dime.

96
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,620
So we put that one up there
in the tens place.

97
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,210
We have one plus three is four.

98
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,990
Plus one is five.

99
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,700
So you get fifty-five.

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,000
One plus three plus one is this five.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,060
Thirty-eight plus seventeen is fifty-five.

102
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,140
Or five tens and five ones.

103
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,330
That's the same thing as fifty-five.

104
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,500
Let's do a couple
more problems.

105
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,480
I think you'll see that we
have the tools to tackle

106
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,250
anything, any problem.

107
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,680
Let's say we have forty-seven.

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,500
Let me switch colors just
so it stays interesting.

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,614
Forty-seven plus nine.

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,450
We just look at the ones place.

111
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,120
Seven plus nine.

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,260
We know what that is already.

113
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,750
We did that problem already.

114
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,950
Seven plus nine is sixteen.

115
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,080
So you write the six in the ones
place and carry the one.

116
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,060
And now it's in the tens place.

117
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,050
Because this is one
ten right there.

118
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,350
So one dime plus four
dimes is five dimes.

119
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,850
So it's five dimes and six pennies.

120
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,240
It's fifty-six.

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,278
Let's do slightly
harder problems.

122
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,750
Let me scroll down a little
bit so we have some

123
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,740
space to work with.

124
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,000
We always need that.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,620
All right, let's do
something hard.

126
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,540
Ninety-nine plus eighty-eight.

127
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,510
That's a hard one.

128
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,850
And you just have to look at
the parts of the problem and

129
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,000
you'll see how it'll
all work out.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,060
You say, what's nine plus eight?

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,630
We did that up here.

132
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,670
Nine plus eight we know already is seventeen.

133
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,370
That's a good one to remember.

134
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,750
Nine plus eight is seventeen, but it's
always good to be able

135
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,690
to visualize it as well.

136
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,190
So nine plus eight is seventeen.

137
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,010
Carry the one.

138
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,140
And then we have
one plus nine is ten.

139
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,870
Ten plus eight is eighteen.

140
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,220
Now this is interesting.

141
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,770
We want to write eighteen down.

142
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,620
So we write our eight down there.

143
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,510
We have one plus nine plus eight.

144
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,560
One plus nine plus eight is equal to eighteen.

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,950
We wrote the eight down there and
we say, let's carry the one.

146
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,470
We carry the one, but we carry
it into the hundreds place.

147
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,330
This was the ones place,
the tens place, now we're

148
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,180
in the hundreds place.

149
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,730
But there's nothing else
in the hundreds place.

150
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,250
So it just drops straight down.

151
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,180
So you could almost just
write the eighteen just like that.

152
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,240
So ninety-nine plus eighty-eight is one hundred and eighty-seven.

153
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,260
Let's keep doing some examples.

154
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,750
You could see, it's
all the same pattern.

155
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,290
We could add two ten-digit
numbers to each other as

156
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,260
long as we're just careful
about carrying our digits.

157
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,330
So let's do seven hundred -- let
me switch colors.

158
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,560
Well do some
three-digit numbers.

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,220
Let's do a four-digit number.

160
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,430
Let's not mess around.

161
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,870
Let's do a four-digit number.

162
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:07,910
So let's do four thousand, three hundred and sixty-eight plus five hundred and seventy two.

163
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,120
Let's see what happens here.

164
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,940
I'll write it down here.

165
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,490
Eight plus two.

166
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,970
We know that that
is equal to ten.

167
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,950
You can do the number
line if you need to.

168
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,770
Eight plus two is equal to ten.

169
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,860
Put the zero in the ones
place, carry the one.

170
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,180
Now we're in the tens place.

171
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,270
This is really one ten.

172
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,620
This is six tens.

173
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,800
This is seven tens.

174
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Or you could think of
them as dimes if we're

175
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,700
thinking about change.

176
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,160
So one dime plus six
dimes is seven dimes.

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,550
Seven dimes plus seven dimes is fourteen.

178
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,580
Let me write it like this.

179
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,160
We could write one plus six plus seven
is equal to -- one plus six is seven.

180
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,850
Seven plus seven is fourteen.

181
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,820
So this right here is
going to be equal to fourteen.

182
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,870
Carry the one.

183
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,970
Now we have-- let me do
it in another color.

184
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,800
I'll do it in pink.

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,140
We have one plus three.

186
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,010
We're in the
hundreds place now.

187
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,120
Plus five.

188
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,140
One plus three plus five.

189
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,010
Well, one plus three is four.

190
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,750
Plus five is nine.

191
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,990
Four plus five is nine, so this is
going to be equal to nine.

192
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,380
Nothing to carry.

193
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,720
We only had something
in our ones place.

194
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,670
Nine is just nine pennies.

195
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,720
It's no dimes.

196
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,370
It's just nine pennies.

197
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,350
And then we go to the
thousands place.

198
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,750
Nothing to add to the
thousands place.

199
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,040
So you just take this four thousand --
you see a four here, but since

200
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,030
it's in the fourth digit to
the left, this means four thousand.

201
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,200
So this four thousand right here, we
don't have any other thousands

202
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,940
to add it to, so we just
bring it straight down.

203
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,570
So you bring the four down there.

204
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:50,860
So four thousand, three hundred and sixty-eight plus five hundred and seventy-two is four thousand --
we'll put a comma there

205
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,038
to make it easy to read --

206
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,945
four thousand, nine hundred and forty.
