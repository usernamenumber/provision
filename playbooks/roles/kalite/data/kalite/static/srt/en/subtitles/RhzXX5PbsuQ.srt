00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:08,002
We are asked to simplify a log base 5 of 25 to the "x" power over "y"

2
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,909
So I will give you some logarithm properties and I do agree that this does require some simplification

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,097
over here

4
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:18,309
That this having this right over here inside of the logarithm is not a pleasant way to look at it

5
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:23,633
So the first thing that we realize is that this is one of our logarithm properties

6
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:28,247
So logarithm for a given base so lets say that the base is "x" of a/b

7
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:34,910
That is equal to log base "x" of a minus log base "x" of b

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,241
Now here we have 25 to the "x" over y

9
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:43,659
So we can simplify

10
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:50,826
Log base 5 twenty five to the "x" over "y" to this property means that its the same thing

11
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:58,140
as log base 5 to the twenty five to the "x" power minus log base 5 of "y"

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,947
Now this looks like we can do a little bit of simplifying

13
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:10,451
It seems like the relevant logarithm property here is if I have log base "x" of a to the "p" power

14
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:15,985
That's the same thing as b times log base "x" of a

15
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:19,734
This exponent over here can go outfront, which is what we did right over there

16
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:27,497
So this part right over here can be written as "x" times the logarithm of base 5

17
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:34,450
of 25 and then of course we have minus log base 5 of "y"

18
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,507
And this is useful beacuse log base 5 of 25 is actually very easy to think about

19
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:48,453
This part right here is asking us what power

20
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:53,033
do I have to raise 5 to to get to 25

21
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,417
So we have to raise 5 to the 2nd power to get 25.

22
00:01:54,417 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are left with, this is equal to 2 times "x" minus log base 5 of "y"
