1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,370
I am here with Dr. Lawrence Baker

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,004
from Stanford Medical School,

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,067
who specializes in healthcare policy,

4
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,638
and I have just a very basic question:

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,885
and that is we see these BlueCross and BlueShield

6
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:13,624
all of the time and sometimes are used together.

7
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:15,006
Sometimes are used differently.

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,608
This seems confusing to me.

9
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,137
What are these things

10
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:19,666
and how are they related to each other?

11
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,200
Dr. Baker: They're related in some really interesting ways.

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,616
They go way back in time ...

13
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:27,982
So BlueCross and BlueShield began as separate things.

14
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:28,967
Let's see if I can get this right.

15
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:31,166
BlueShield was started by doctors

16
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,366
who wanted to set up a Healthcare plan

17
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:36,898
and to help their patients get coverage for healthcare

18
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:40,846
(Sal Khan: preventive shields - right right).

19
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,214
So that was started longtime ago:

20
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:44,886
these both go back BlueShield and BlueCross

21
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:48,601
to the 1930s really they're getting started.

22
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,457
BlueCross was started by the hospitals

23
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:54,033
separately from BlueShield originally.

24
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,660
They get together later as a way

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,168
to help patients to get coverage for hospital care.

26
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:00,281
Sal: I guess the cross is because once you're in the hospital

27
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:02,167
you might get a little religious.

28
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:04,159
Dr. Baker: Exactly! I mean not sure

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,202
if that's why they had in mind originally but...

30
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:07,967
Sal: But what about the BLUE?

31
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,360
Dr. Baker: I don't know where the BLUE comes from.

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,544
Sal: Is that just the color that makes people feel good?

33
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:11,700
It's like a healthcare color?

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,024
Dr. Baker: think it must be healthcare color.

35
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:14,352
Sal: Red would be inappropriate.

36
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:16,628
Dr. Baker: Let's go with blue. Blue is.. you're not bleeding.

37
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:19,628
Sal: Exactly! Blue is...you look at the sky. OK!

38
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,758
What happens I do see these words used together.

39
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:25,219
So these were separate plans?

40
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,821
Doctors created the BlueShield,

41
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,747
Hospitals created the BlueCross.

42
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:31,794
Dr. Baker: and then they grew over time and changed.

43
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:33,462
So they got started in the 30s,

44
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:37,502
they were..around through the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s..

45
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,500
and so a couple of things happened along the way

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,332
that starts to make things confusing a little bit.

47
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,233
One is that they're operating in every state,

48
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:47,162
to some extent independently.

49
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:50,205
So states regulate health insurance in this country or..

50
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:52,673
have a lot to do with regulating health insurance in this country.

51
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:55,327
And so every state had its own laws and as a result..

52
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:58,567
the BlueCross and the BlueShield plans in different states

53
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,165
grew up in different ways.

54
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:02,827
So what you come down to today is really different plans..

55
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,779
in every state because of this history of development.

56
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:07,433
As states developed their laws differently,

57
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,367
the plans would evolve in the different states separately.

58
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,123
Sal: I see, just to give myself a kind of framework of

59
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:15,606
what was happening is in the pre 1920s, early 1930s:

60
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:17,633
there were not really weren't healthcare plans,

61
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:20,575
the physicians say, hey we want people to have a way

62
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,617
for people to see us without having to, you know,

63
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,870
someway for them to be paying a little bit every month

64
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,100
or every year and that is,

65
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
if something would happen, they can see the doctors.

66
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,374
The hospitals kind of have the same model but

67
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,296
they did it differently in every state,

68
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:35,588
because the state is the regulatory.

69
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,015
Dr. Baker: The state, especially in the 1930s,

70
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,110
there weren't a lot of state regulations

71
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,204
about the health insurance.

72
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:41,148
There wasn't health insurance. But as states evolved,

73
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:43,422
as their healthcare system evolved, as their plans evolved,

74
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,363
it grew separately

75
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,304
in slightly different directions in every state.

76
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:49,837
So that led to the formation- really of you see..

77
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,938
BlueCross of Tennessee or BlueShield of Florida,

78
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,437
BlueCross/BlueShield of Michigan.

79
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,498
They are all different

80
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:57,379
because they are all in their own state environment.

81
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,071
Sal: So this is normally these kinds of brands,

82
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:03,068
we all have heard of them in that way.

83
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:06,111
But normally a brand means something.

84
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,805
It means more quality or less quality.

85
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:10,289
But in...or some type of spin on....you know

86
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,763
Apple means fun consumer experience

87
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:13,975
or something like that.

88
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,260
But in this case - if I'm hearing you correctly

89
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,088
If there's BlueCross of California and BlueCross of Texas:

90
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,567
they have nothing to do with each other

91
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,233
or very little to do with each other?

92
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,614
Dr. Baker: So they all had their start kind of together in the 30s,

93
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:29,633
and then they've all grown in their own ways.

94
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,238
But they've stayed related and

95
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,299
some of them to greater extents than others.

96
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,396
So one of the things that happened, along the way,

97
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:38,155
was that they formed an association.

98
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,477
There's now something in the US called

99
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,938
the BlueCross/BlueShield Association.

100
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:44,539
Which is - I guess -

101
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:47,557
an association of a lot of the plans in different states

102
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,282
that allows them to talk to each other,

103
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,546
to try to work together.

104
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:52,179
Sal: This is an umbrella

105
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:54,627
for all of the BlueCross and all of the BlueShield.

106
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:56,845
So that's why we hear them used so frequently together,

107
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,146
people say: BlueCross/BlueShield.

108
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,375
Dr. Baker: Yeah, so there are 2 reasons

109
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,573
that you hear that together.

110
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,299
One is the Association that tries

111
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,025
to work with plans from both groups.

112
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,180
The other is that in some states, over time,

113
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,612
the 2 got together

114
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,291
and actually became 1 health insurance plan.

115
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,404
So there are states where the health insurance plan

116
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:14,609
is BlueCross and BlueShield of a state.

117
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,745
And there are other states where they stayed separate.

118
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,256
So, we're here in California

119
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:19,767
where BlueShield and BlueCross

120
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,085
have historically stayed as separate plans.

121
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,688
But there are some states where they're the same thing

122
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,708
and then you hear BlueCross and BlueShield.

123
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,284
Sal: So if someone tells you BlueCross of State X,

124
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,606
that just means to you Health Insurance Plan.

125
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:35,216
There is nothing else that you can really take from that.

126
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:36,482
Dr. Baker: So once upon a time,

127
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:38,432
you may have been able to take more from it.

128
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:39,700
But these days...

129
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,008
it's possible for them to vary in quite a few different ways.

130
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,470
Some of the BlueCross and BlueShield plans -

131
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,490
especially the BlueCross plans

132
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,510
have become 'for-profit' plans.

133
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,201
So historically these were always non-profit, but in the last..

134
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:52,332
Sal: So, BlueCross especially:

135
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,463
some of them have gone for-profit?

136
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:56,219
Dr. Baker: Yes, but I think in both cases.

137
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:59,338
But BlueCross is the one that I pay more attention to.

138
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,062
Sal: Right.

139
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:05,089
Dr. Baker: So they may be for-profit or not-for-profit plans.

140
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,736
They may act in similar ways,

141
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:09,268
and they do because the Association

142
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,801
- at least the ones in the Association -

143
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,879
tend to act with some similarity from place to place.

144
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,747
Sal: and just to - because I've explained this all the time -

145
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,395
about even Khan Academy is a not-for-profit.

146
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:20,228
A not-for-profit is an entity, it can in theory charge revenue.

147
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:22,550
Khan Academy doesn't. But it could charge revenue

148
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,547
but there is no owner of the organization

149
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:26,149
who can, kind of, become rich off of it.

150
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,984
It is owned by the public.

151
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,818
While for-profit has shareholders

152
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:32,399
and it can be bought and sold

153
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,859
and issue dividends and all the rest.

154
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,227
Dr. Baker: Yes, so historically in America,

155
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:38,567
most healthcare plans were not-for-profit entities.

156
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:43,146
They couldn't take money that they earned and

157
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,515
give it out to people who might be the owners

158
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:46,954
- it had to be reinvested.

159
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,126
In fact even in the early days of BlueCross and BlueShield

160
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:52,211
in some states they were treated as quasi public entities,

161
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,081
and they've kind of grown away from that a bit more.

162
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,824
But there's this history,

163
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,567
especially with BlueCross and BlueShield,

164
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,468
a very not-for-profit public spirited entities.

165
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,651
When you get to for-profit plans,

166
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:05,623
which we really didn't have in the US in a big way

167
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:07,899
until maybe the last decade or two.

168
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,314
Where we've seen some conversions,

169
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:12,729
these are situations where the plan can act explicitly

170
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,143
as a profit generator for its shareholders, for its owners.

171
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:18,263
Sal: Right and some are now publicly traded

172
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:20,136
and they're on the stock exchange.

173
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:21,924
And so when we talk about some of them

174
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,712
becoming for-profit here,

175
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:27,410
it's that, literally, the license to use the name

176
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,446
either BlueCross or BlueShield,

177
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:31,628
or maybe some of the assets of the former not-for-profit

178
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,441
are somehow transferred.. or,

179
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,904
I guess, the for-profit buys them.

180
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,179
Dr. Baker: So we had a series of these things.

181
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,065
We call them conversions:

182
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,780
when the company converted

183
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,495
from being a not-for-profit to a for-profit.

184
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,215
There were a lot of states in which

185
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,955
those conversions, or situations in which they happen,

186
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:52,156
where the public - the government -

187
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:56,748
somebody compelled the for-profit entity

188
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:59,401
in the conversion to create a public good.

189
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:01,328
So there are some foundations that now exist but..

190
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:02,567
Sal: Oh, I see.

191
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,418
Dr. Baker: In the conversion,

192
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,158
they allowed a transfer of not-for-profit to for-profit

193
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,545
but you had to create something valuable for the public.

194
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,546
So some of the things that we see now in states:

195
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,915
some of the big foundations that exist in healthcare

196
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,494
are conversion foundations

197
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,073
around the for-profit conversions of..

198
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:20,936
Sal: I see. But, when we see things like,

199
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:23,528
I always get confused between BlueCross and BlueShield,

200
00:07:23,528 --> 00:07:26,800
but I believe that Anthem has a Blue...

201
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,797
Dr. Baker: BlueCross in California.

202
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:33,906
So Anthem is a company that is - well

203
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:36,228
it is a large company that has BlueCross,

204
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:39,564
I think mostly BlueCross or all BlueCross,

205
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:42,125
affiliates or sub-entities in different states.

206
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,797
I think that they have 14 or 15.

207
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,862
Sal: Right, so these are for-profit BlueCrosses,

208
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:48,428
if they have Anthem with them?

209
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:49,710
Dr. Baker: I believe that's correct.

210
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,628
Sal: Right, right.

211
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,544
And, is there any, I guess how they operate,

212
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,030
from a consumer point of view, any difference

213
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,543
between a for-profit BlueCross or BlueShield?

214
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,412
Anything that we can tell?

215
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,613
Dr. Baker: So that's a really interesting question.

216
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,280
There are people who've gone to look and

217
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,045
they've tried to, sometimes,

218
00:08:04,045 --> 00:08:05,810
find some evidence for differences.

219
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,273
There are a few studies out there where

220
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,805
people can find some differences but

221
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,284
there is not a lot of evidence

222
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,763
that they behave really differently.

223
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,256
At the end of the day,

224
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:14,749
they have to compete in the same market place

225
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:17,071
for the business of the same companies, the same people.

226
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,881
And if they behave really obviously different:

227
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:21,700
if one was obviously way better than the other,

228
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,898
the market would sort out who is going to win this.

229
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:26,146
And the market has allowed both types to exist.

230
00:08:26,146 --> 00:08:28,273
So, there are certainly differences

231
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,400
in the written charters and

232
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,161
maybe differences in the preferences in the stated ideals

233
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,880
of the people who run these organizations

234
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,737
and that might make a difference in some cases.

235
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:40,036
But it is hard when you aggregate it all together and

236
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,404
you really go try to do national data or something

237
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,152
to find a big difference.

238
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:46,033
Sal: So the big picture here is,

239
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:48,627
as much as I've looked at healthcare plans even when

240
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,996
we're trying to figure out for employees at Khan Academy,

241
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,435
which healthcare plan to choose and which not.

242
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:53,271
And I've thought: Oh,

243
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,222
what's the difference between BlueCross and BlueShied?

244
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,615
There's actually very little that I can tell

245
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:58,033
just by looking at those brands.

246
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,364
I really have to dig deeper

247
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:00,695
into the actually healthcare policy.

248
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,024
That's going to be different from state to state.

249
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:05,167
Some will be for-profit, some will be not-for-profit,

250
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,901
and even that's not enough to tell you.

251
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:07,691
General rule of thumb:

252
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,595
you really have to look at the healthcare plans.

253
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,545
Dr. Baker: You have to look at the healthcare plans

254
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:12,892
and it's BlueCross and BlueShield, but

255
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,216
there's other plans out there.

256
00:09:14,216 --> 00:09:15,539
There's Kaiser around here.

257
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,818
There's Aetna and Cigna and other plans.

258
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:20,367
And they can vary from state to state and

259
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,900
even within, you can see variations.

260
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,640
So BlueCross in California or BlueShield in California

261
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,700
might offer some different types of choices.

262
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,306
So if you said that I've got a really nice plan from BlueCross

263
00:09:31,306 --> 00:09:33,303
and I look at another state and you look at a BlueCross plan

264
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:36,300
it might be that you're just looking at a less generous one,

265
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,225
where there is another you could look at.

266
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,640
So you even need to look within a company at the specifics.

267
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,962
Sal: Definitely when we go from state to state,

268
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,936
it would be weird to have brand loyalty.

269
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:47,367
Dr. Baker: Yeah, BlueCross and BlueShield have

270
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,601
this history of being public spirited entities

271
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:52,877
and some of that persists to this day.

272
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,270
Maybe that is something to think about but

273
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,454
in a general sense,

274
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,639
there are so many things that they can vary on

275
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,288
that you'd want to be very careful

276
00:09:58,288 --> 00:09:59,936
with any choice you're making

277
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,633
and know that it can really vary across state lines.

278
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,708
Sal: Interesting.
