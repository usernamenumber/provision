1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,060
We want to figure out the limit
as x approaches 1 of the

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:14,570
expression x over x minus
1 minus 1 over the

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,930
natural log of x.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,900
So let's just see what
happens when we just

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,230
try to plug in the 1.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,630
What happens if we evaluate
this expression at 1?

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,050
Well then, we're going to get
a one here, over 1 minus 1.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,040
So we're going to get something
like a 1 over a 0, minus 1

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,520
over, and what's the
natural log of 1?

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,250
e to the what power
is equal to one?

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,140
Well, anything to the zeroth
power is equal to 1, so e to

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,420
the zeroth power is going to
be equal to 1, so the natural

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,350
log of 1 is going to be 0.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,820
So we get the strange,
undefined 1 over

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,300
0 minus 1 over 0.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,370
It's this bizarre-looking
undefined form.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,820
But it's not the indeterminate
type of form that we looked

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,880
for in l'Hopital's rule.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,625
We're not getting a 0 over
a 0, we're not getting an

20
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:03,750
infinity over an infinity.

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,640
So you might just say, hey,
OK, this is a non-l'Hopital's

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,150
rule problem.

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,910
We're going to have to figure
out this limit some other way.

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,210
And I would say, well
don't give up just yet!

25
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,880
Maybe we can manipulate this
algebraically somehow so that

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,380
it will give us the l'Hopital
indeterminate form, and then

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,040
we can just apply the rule.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,790
And to do that, let's just
see, what happens if we

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,470
add these two expressions?

30
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,865
So if we add them, so this
expression, if we add it, it

31
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:32,160
will be, well, the common
denominator is going to be x

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,850
minus 1 times the
natural log of x.

33
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,740
I just multiplied
the denominators.

34
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,420
And then the numerator is going
to be, well, if I multiply

35
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,436
essentially this whole term by
natural log of x, so it's going

36
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:51,317
to be x natural log of x, and
then this whole term I'm going

37
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,930
to multiply by x minus one.

38
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,955
So minus x minus 1.

39
00:01:54,955 --> 00:01:58,510
41
00:01:58,51 --> 00:02:00,54
And you could break it apart
and see that this expression

40
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,870
and this expression
are the same thing.

41
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,220
Let me get rid of that.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,430
And then this right here is the
same thing as 1 over natural

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,510
log of x, because the x
minus 1's cancel out.

44
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,630
So hopefully you realize,
all I did is I added

45
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,120
these two expressions.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,110
So given that, let's see what
happens if I take the limit as

47
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,600
x approaches 1 of this thing.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,010
Because these are
the same thing.

49
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,320
Do we get anything
more interesting?

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
So what do we have here?

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,810
We have one times the
natural log of 1.

52
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,650
The natural log of 1 is 0, so
we have 0 here, so that is a 0.

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,200
Minus 1 minus 0, so that's
going to be another 0, minus 0.

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,100
the natural log of 1, which is
0, so 0 times 0, that is 0.

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,960
And there you have it.

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,940
We have indeterminate form that
we need for l'Hopital's rule,

57
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,110
assuming that if we take the
derivative of that, and put it

58
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,360
over the derivative of that,
that that limit exists.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,130
So let's try to do it.

60
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,340
So this is going to be equal
to, if the limit exists, this

61
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,200
is going to be equal to the
limit as x approaches 1.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,490
And let's take the derivative
in magenta, I'll take

63
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,190
the derivative of this
numerator right over here.

64
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,590
And for this first term,
just do the product rule.

65
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,970
Derivative of x is one, and
then so 1 times the natural log

66
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,920
of x, the derivative of the
first term times

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,930
the second term.

68
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,570
And then we're going to have
plus the derivative of the

69
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,820
second term plus 1 over
x times the first term.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,430
It's just the product rule.

71
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,920
So 1 over x times x, we're
going to see, that's just 1,

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,390
and then we have minus the
derivative of x minus 1.

73
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,450
Well, the derivative of x minus
1 is just 1, so it's just

74
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,090
going to be minus 1.

75
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:08,710
And then, all of that is over
the derivative of this thing.

76
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,340
So let's take the derivative
of that, over here.

77
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,600
So the derivative of the first
term, of x minus 1, is just 1.

78
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,330
Multiply that times the second
term, you get natural log of x.

79
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,520
And then plus the derivative of
the second term, derivative

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,350
of natural log of x is one
over x, times x minus 1.

81
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,140
88
00:04:32,14 --> 00:04:34,24
I think we can simplify
this a little bit.

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,270
This 1 over x times
x, that's a 1.

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,580
We're going to
subtract one from it.

84
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,910
So these cancel
out, right there.

85
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,710
And so this whole expression
can be rewritten as the limit

86
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:51,260
as approaches 1, the numerator
is just natural log of x, do

87
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,160
that in magenta, and the
denominator is the natural log

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,600
of x plus x minus 1 over x

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,250
So let's try to evaluate
this limit here.

90
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,060
So if we take x approaches one
of natural log of x, that

91
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,640
will give us a, well,
natural log of 1 is 0.

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,720
And over here, we get natural
log of 1, which is 0.

93
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,920
And then plus 1 minus 1 over
plus 1 minus 1 over 1, well,

94
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,900
that's just going
to be another 0.

95
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,810
1 minus 1 is zero.

96
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,680
So you're going to
have 0 plus 0.

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,140
So you're going to get
a 0 over 0 again.

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,740
0 over 0.

99
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,230
So once again, let's apply
l'Hopital's rule again.

100
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,890
Let's take the derivative
of that, put it over

101
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,240
the derivative of that.

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,210
So this, if we're ever going to
get to a limit, is going to be

103
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:51,950
equal to the limit as x
approaches 1 of the derivative

104
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,320
of the numerator, 1 over x,
right, the derivative of ln of

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,340
x is 1/x, over the derivative
of the denominator.

106
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,160
And what's that?

107
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,950
Well, derivative of natural
log of x is 1 over x plus

108
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,590
derivative of x minus 1 over x.

109
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,120
You could view it this way,
as 1 over x times x minus 1.

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,730
Well, derivative of x to the
negative 1, we'll take the

111
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,280
derivative of the first one
times the second thing, and

112
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,670
then the derivative of the
second thing times

113
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,610
the first thing.

114
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,980
So the derivative of the first
term, x to the negative 1, is

115
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,030
negative x to the negative 2
times the second term, times x

116
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,830
minus 1, plus the derivative of
the second term, which is

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,780
just 1 times the first
term, plus 1 over x.

118
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,060
So this is going to be equal
to, I just had a random thing

119
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,860
pop up on my computer.

120
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,730
Sorry for that little
sound, if you heard it.

121
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,780
But where was I?

122
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,710
Oh, let's just simplify
this over here.

123
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,210
We were doing our
l'Hopital's rule.

124
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,010
So this is going to be equal
to, let me, this is going to be

125
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,870
equal to, if we evaluate x as
equal to 1, the numerator is

126
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,610
just 1/1, which is just 1.

127
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,406
So we're definitely not going
to have an indeterminate or

128
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:09,480
at least a 0/0 form anymore.

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,080
And the denominator is going to
be, if you evaluate it at 1,

130
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,180
this is 1/1, which is 1, plus
negative 1 to the negative 2.

131
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,490
So, or you say, 1 to the
negative 2 is just 1, it's

132
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,445
just a negative one.

133
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:24,820
But then you multiply that
times 1 minus 1, which is

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,100
0, so this whole term's
going to cancel out.

135
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,890
And you have a plus
another 1 over 1.

136
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,090
So plus 1 And so this is
going to be equal to 1/2.

137
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,990
And there you have it.

138
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,620
Using L'Hopital's rule and a
couple of steps, we solved

139
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,050
something that at least
initially didn't look

140
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,260
like it was 0/0.

141
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,110
We just added the 2 terms, got
0/0, took derivatives of the

142
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,460
numerators and the denominators
2 times in a row to

143
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,180
eventually get our limit.

144
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:49,333
