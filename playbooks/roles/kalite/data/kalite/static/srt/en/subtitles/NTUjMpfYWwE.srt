1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,676
Japan was not a major actor in World War 1, but it did play a role.

2
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:12,512
Right as war broke in August of 1914, the Japanese were interested in taking control of German posessions

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,569
and they were already allies with the British

4
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,436
so they communicated with the British

5
00:00:16,436 --> 00:00:17,903
and they came to an agreement that

6
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:20,394
if Japan were to attack German posessions

7
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,397
in the Pacific and in China

8
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,836
then Japan could take control of them

9
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:26,502
and so Japan proceeded to do this

10
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:30,169
in particular it took a siege of Sing Tao

11
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,376
which, we already talked about, was a German posession

12
00:00:32,376 --> 00:00:34,169
these are Japanese boats landing there

13
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:35,311
Japanese troops

14
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,058
and this was of technological significance

15
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:42,716
it was the first time that you had a naval based aerial assault

16
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,902
this wasn't really using

17
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,902
what we would consider aircraft carriers

18
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,396
although they did carry the aircraft

19
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:49,973
but they would place them into the water

20
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:52,769
and the aircraft would take off from the water

21
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,702
as they tried to take the town of Sing Tao

22
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:57,236
which they were eventually able to do

23
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:59,812
by the end of 1914

24
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:02,396
On top of that they were able to take control

25
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,441
of many of Germany's other posessions

26
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,508
in the Pacific

27
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:08,647
specifically the Pacific islands

28
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,103
And on top of that Japan did send

29
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:13,390
some aspects, or some parts of it's navy

30
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,481
to help protect allied fleets

31
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,375
as far away as the Mediterranean

32
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,502
Japan did play a role here

33
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:22,478
The other interesting historical note

34
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,728
because of Japan's involvement in World War 1

35
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,903
is what came out of the negotiations

36
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:29,371
First of all, by being involved

37
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:32,730
kind of put Japan at the seat of major powers

38
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,242
and as we will see in World War 2

39
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,236
Japan ends up being one of the major players

40
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,066
in World War 2

41
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,836
and it's essentially going on the other side

42
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:39,836
by that point

43
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:42,436
But because of it's help of the Allies

44
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,369
Japan does have a seat at the table

45
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,433
of the Paris Peace Conference

46
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,647
And as they are negotiating the treaty of Versailles

47
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,042
and coming up with the Leauge of Nations

48
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,441
Japan is eager to, kind of, have an equal

49
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:55,396
footing with all the other European powers

50
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:57,902
and so it attempts to place this

51
00:01:57,902 --> 00:02:00,016
in the charter for the Leauge of Nations

52
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:02,218
the equality of nations being a basic principle

53
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:03,649
of the League of Nations

54
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,765
the high contracting parties agree to accord

55
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:10,058
as soon as possible to all alien nationals

56
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:12,169
of states members of the League

57
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:15,175
equal and just treatment in every respect

58
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:16,770
let me underline that

59
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,441
equal and just treatment in every respect

60
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,551
making no distinction either in law or in fact

61
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,552
on account of their race or nationality

62
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,039
essentially the Japanese were saying

63
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,102
hey look, you Europeans, you guys have to view us

64
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:34,108
and based on the way this is phrased

65
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:36,233
other people as equals

66
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:39,976
And just to get a sense of what the world was like then

67
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:41,722
this was not passed

68
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:45,056
even though the Leauge of Nations was the product of these very idealistic thoughts

69
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,236
by Woodrow Wilson

70
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,769
it did not get passed

71
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,307
obviously the British may have subjugated many people in their empires

72
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:57,135
Woodrow Wilson was afraid that if this were to be included in the Leauge of Nations

73
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,974
it would have trouble passing

74
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:01,902
getting ratified in the segregated South

75
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:03,799
we now know later that the League of Nations

76
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,569
was not ratified anyway

77
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,302
and so this essentially does not happen

78
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,305
And even the Japanese themselves

79
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:13,057
they were eager for equality for themselves

80
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:15,974
but as we will see as we enter the World War 2

81
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,976
they themselves had a sense of racial superiority

82
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:22,902
and they subjugated many of the other people in Asia

83
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,969
especially the Chinese and the Koreans

84
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:28,502
This is an interesting quote for the Chinese delegation

85
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:33,722
We are not too proud to fight, but we are to proud to accept a place of admitted inferiority

86
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:36,842
in dealing with one of more of the associated nations

87
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,388
We want nothing but simple justice

88
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,570
So tells you how different the world was

89
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,236
this is not even a hundred years ago

90
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:45,902
and the real relevance of World War 1

91
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:46,699
for Japan

92
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,699
was it elevated it to becoming one of the powers of the world
