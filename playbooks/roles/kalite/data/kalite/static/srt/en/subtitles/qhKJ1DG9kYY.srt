1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's try to fill in our Laplace
transform table a

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:03,960
little bit more.

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,000
And a good place to start is
just to write our definition

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,820
of the Laplace transform.

6
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:14,240
The Laplace transform of some
function f of t is equal to

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,340
the integral from 0 to infinity,
of e to the minus

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,540
st, times our function,
f of t dt.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,860
That's our definition.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,330
The very first one we solved
for-- we could even do it on

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,630
the side right here-- was the
Laplace transform of 1.

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,550
You know, we could almost view
that as t to the 0, and that

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,220
was equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,490
f of t was just 1, so it's e to
the minus st, dt, which is

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,080
equal to the antiderivative of
e to the minus st, which is

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,910
minus 1 over s, e to the minus
st. And then you have to

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,870
evaluate that from
0 to infinity.

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,380
When you take the limit as this
term approaches infinity,

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,740
this e to the minus, this
becomes e to the minus

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,529
infinity, if we assume
s is greater than 0.

21
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:08,160
So if we assume s is greater
than 0, this whole

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,400
term goes to 0.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,720
So you end up with a 0 minus
this thing evaluated at 0.

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,330
So when you evaluate t is equal
to 0, this term right

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,790
here becomes 1, e to the 0
becomes 1, so it's minus minus

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,585
1/s, which is the same
thing as plus 1/s.

27
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:29,670
the?

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,960
Laplace transform of 1,
of just the constant

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,940
function 1, is 1/s.

30
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,660
We already solved that.

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,700
Now, let's increment
it a little bit.

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,270
Let's see if we can figure out
the Laplace transform of t.

33
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,720
So we can view this
as t to the 0.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,750
Now this is t to the 1.

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,130
This is going to be equal to
the integral from 0 to

36
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:58,870
infinity, of e to the
minus st times t dt.

37
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,560
Now.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,210
I can tell you right now
that I don't have the

39
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,870
antiderivative of
this memorized.

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,030
I don't know what it is.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,680
But there's a sense that the
integration by parts could be

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,269
useful, because integration by
parts kind of decomposes into

43
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,680
a simpler problem.

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,230
And I always forget integration
by parts, so I'll

45
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,240
rederive it here in
this purple color.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,960
So if we have u times v, if we
take the derivative with

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,620
respect to t of that, that's
equal to the derivative of the

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,180
first times the second function
plus the first

49
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,190
function times the derivative
of the second function.

50
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,950
It's just the product rule.

51
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,070
Now, if we take the integral
of both sides of this

52
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,950
equation, we get uv is equal
to the antiderivative of u

53
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,250
prime v plus the antiderivative
of uv prime.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,680
Now, since we want to apply
this to an integral, maybe

55
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,080
let's make this what we want
to solve for, so we can get

56
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,120
the integral of uv prime is
equal to-- we can just

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,310
subtract this from that side
of the equation, so it's

58
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,290
equal-- I'm just swapping the
sides, so I'm just solving for

59
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,330
this, and to solve for this, I
just subtract this from that,

60
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,390
so it's equal to uv minus the
integral of u prime v.

61
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,290
So there you go.

62
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,040
Even though I have trouble
memorizing this formula, it's

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,660
not too hard to rederive as
long as you remember the

64
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,350
product rule right there.

65
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,880
So if we're going to do
integration by parts, it's

66
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,740
good to define our v prime to
be something that's easy to

67
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,460
take the antiderivative of,
because we're going to have to

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,480
figure out v later on, and
it's good to take u to be

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,690
something that's easy take
the derivative of.

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's make t is equal to our
u and let's make e to the

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,010
minus st as being our v prime.

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,810
If that's the case,
then what is v?

73
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,440
Well, v's just the
antiderivative of that.

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,970
In fact, we've done it before.

75
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:59,830
It's minus 1/s, e to the
minus st. That's v.

76
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,800
And then if we want to figure
out u prime, because we're

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,980
going to have to figure out that
later anyway, u prime's

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,000
just the derivative of t.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,980
That's just equal to 1.

80
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,020
So let's apply this.

81
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:21,480
Let's see, so the Laplace
transform of t is equal to uv.

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,890
u is t, v is this right here.

83
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:35,880
It's times minus 1/s, e to the
minus st. e to the minus st,

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,820
that's the uv term
right there.

85
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,110
And this is a definite
integral, right?

86
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,980
So we're going to evaluate
this term right

87
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,210
here from 0 to infinity.

88
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:56,190
And then it's minus the integral
from 0 to infinity of

89
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,530
u prime, which is
just 1 times v.

90
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,060
v, we just figured out here, is
minus-- let me write it in

91
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,720
v's color-- times minus 1/s--
this is my v right here--

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,610
minus 1/s, e to the
minus st, dt.

93
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,860
All of that is dt.

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,900
   

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,540
So let's see if we can
simplify this.

96
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:31,640
So this is equal to minus t/s,
e to the minus st, evaluated

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,740
from 0 to infinity.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,030
And let's see, we could take--
well, this is just 1.

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,080
1 times anything is 1.

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,430
We can just not write that.

101
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,170
And then bring the
minus 1/s out.

102
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,180
So if we bring the minus 1/s
out, this becomes plus 1/s

103
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,330
times the integral from
0 to infinity of e to

104
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,360
the minus st, dt.

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,640
And this should look
familiar to you.

106
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,950
This is exactly what we
solved for right here.

107
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,150
It was the Laplace
transform of 1.

108
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,850
So let's keep that in mind.

109
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,010
So this right here is the
Laplace transform of 1.

110
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,500
And I want to write it that way,
because we're going to

111
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,700
see a pattern of this
in the next video.

112
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,580
I'm going to write that as
a Laplace transform of 1.

113
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,180
But what is this equal to?

114
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,300
So we're going to evaluate this
as it adds to infinity

115
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,790
and then subtract from
that evaluated at 0.

116
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,520
You can kind of view it as a
substitution, so this is equal

117
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,240
to-- well, let me write
it this way.

118
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:36,550
It's the limit as A approaches
infinity, of minus A/s, e to

119
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,580
the minus sA.

120
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,100
So that's this evaluated
at infinity.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,900
And then from that, we're
going to subtract this

122
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,960
evaluated at 0.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,360
So minus all of this, but we
already have a minus sign

124
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,420
here, so we could
write a plus.

125
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,930
Plus 0/s times e to the
minus s times 0.

126
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,670
And then, of course, we have
this term right here.

127
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,030
So let me write that term.

128
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,330
I'll do it in yellow or
let me do it in blue.

129
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,040
Plus 1/s-- that's this right
there-- times the Laplace

130
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,650
transform of 1.

131
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,890
And what do we get?

132
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,590
So what's the limit of this
as A approaches infinity?

133
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,270
You might say, wow, you know, as
A approaches infinity right

134
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,320
here, this becomes a
really big number.

135
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,510
There's a minus sign in there,
so it would be a really big

136
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,550
negative number.

137
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,575
But this is an exponent.

138
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,340
A is an exponent right here.

139
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,520
So e to the minus infinity is
going to go to zero much

140
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,160
faster than this is going
to go to infinity.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,570
This term right here is a much
stronger function, I guess is

142
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,230
the way you could see it.

143
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,830
And you could try it out on your
calculator, if you don't

144
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,660
believe me.

145
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,470
This term is going to overpower
this term and so

146
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:51,490
this whole thing is going
to go to zero.

147
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,910
Likewise, e to the minus-- e
to the 0, this is 1, but

148
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,170
you're multiplying it times a
zero, so this is also going to

149
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,800
go to zero, which is convenient
because all of this

150
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,620
stuff just disappears.

151
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,530
And we're left with the Laplace
transform of t is

152
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:14,240
equal to 1/s times the Laplace
transform of 1.

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,160
And we know what the Laplace
transform of 1 is.

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,135
The Laplace transform of 1-- we
just did it at beginning of

155
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:24,840
the video-- was equal to 1/s,
if we assume that s is

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,450
greater than zero.

157
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,300
In fact, we have to assume that
s was greater than zero

158
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,680
here in order to assume that
this goes to zero.

159
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,370
Only if s is greater than zero,
when you get a minus

160
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,559
infinity here does this
approach zero.

161
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,360
So fair enough.

162
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,710
So the Laplace transform of t
is equal to 1/s times 1/s,

163
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,760
which is equal to 1/s squared,
where s is greater than zero.

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,330
So we have one more entry
in our table, and

165
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,890
then we can use this.

166
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,460
What we're going to do in the
next video is build up to the

167
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,940
Laplace transform of t to
any arbitrary exponent.

168
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,230
And we'll do this in
the next video.
