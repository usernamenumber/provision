1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,270
Say I have some matrix A --
let's say A is n by n, so it

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,390
looks something like this.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,990
You've seen this before,
a 1 1, a 1 2, all

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,690
the way to a 1 n.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,980
When you go down the rows you
get a 2 1, that goes all the

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,000
way to a 2 n.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,130
And let's say that there's some
row here, let's say row

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,200
i, it looks like a i 1,
all the way to a i n.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,710
And then you have some other row
here, a j, it's a j 1 all

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,330
the way to a j n.

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:42,380
And then you keep going all the
way down to a n 1, a n 2,

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,020
all the way to a n n.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,070
This is just an n by n matrix,
and you can see that I took a

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,030
little trouble to write out my
row a, my i'th row here and my

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,360
j'th row here.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,490
And just to kind of keep things
a little simple, let me

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,850
just define -- just for
notational purposes, you can

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,480
view these as row vectors if
you like, but I haven't

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,270
formally defined row
vectors so I won't

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,890
necessarily go there.

22
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,640
But let's just define the term r
i, we'll call that row i, to

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,990
be equal to a i 1, a i 2,
all the way to a i n.

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,390
You can write it as
a vector if you

25
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,500
like, like a row vector.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,450
We haven't really defined
operations on row vectors that

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,050
well yet, but I think
you get the idea.

28
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,620
We can then replace this guy
with r 1, this guy with r 2,

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,510
all the way down.

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,122
Let me do that, and I'll do
that in the next couple of

31
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:39,830
videos because it'll simplify
things, and I think make

32
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,710
things a little bit easier
to understand.

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,890
So I can rewrite this matrix,
this n by n matrix A, I can

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,700
re-write it as just r i.

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,410
Actually, this just looks
like a vector,

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,640
it's just a row vector.

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,790
Let me write it as a
vector like that.

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,490
And I'm being a little bit
hand-wavy here because all of

39
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,980
our vectors have been defined as
column vectors, but I think

40
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,280
you get the idea.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,770
So let's call that r 1, and then
we have r 2 is the next

42
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,960
row, all the way down.

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,140
You keep going down, you get
to r i -- that's this row

44
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,190
right there -- r i.

45
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,690
You keep going down, you get r
j, and then you keep going

46
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,160
down until you get
to the n'th row.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,780
And each of these guys are going
to have n terms because

48
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,540
you have n columns.

49
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,480
So that's another
way of writing

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,870
this same n by n matrix.

51
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,240
Now what I'm going to do here
is, I'm going to create a new

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,490
matrix-- let's call that
swapping the swap

53
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,700
matrix of i and j.

54
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,540
So I'm going to swap i and
j, those two rows.

55
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,790
So what's the matrix
going to look like?

56
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,990
Everything else is going
to be equal.

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,380
You have row 1-- assuming that
1 wasn't one of the i or j's,

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,460
it could have been.

59
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,010
Row 2, all the way down to-- now
instead of a row i there

60
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,400
you have a row j there, and you
go down and instead of a

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,040
row j you have a row i there.

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,200
And you go down and
then you get r n.

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,780
So what did we do?

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,900
We just swapped these
two guys.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,820
That's what the swap
matrix is.

66
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,140
Now I think it was in the last
video or a couple of videos

67
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,530
ago, we learned that if you just
swap two rows of any n by

68
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,020
n matrix, the determinant of the
resulting matrix will be

69
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,520
the negative of the original
determinant.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,040
So we get the determinant of
S, the swap of the i'th and

71
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
the j rows is going to be equal
to the minus of the

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,090
determinant of A.

73
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,430
   

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,360
Now, let me ask you an
interesting question.

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,000
What happens if those two rows
were actually the same?

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,720
What if r i was equal to r j?

77
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,670
If we go back to all of these
guys, if that row is

78
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,150
equal to this row?

79
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,680
That means that this guy is
equal to that guy, that the

80
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,460
second column-- the second
column for that row all the

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,700
way to the n'th guy is equal
to the n'th guy.

82
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,829
That's what I mean when I say
what happens if those two rows

83
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,070
are equal to each other.

84
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,120
Well, if those two rows are
equal to each other, then this

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
matrix is no different than this
matrix here, even though

86
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,020
we swapped them.

87
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,340
If you swap two identical
things, you're just going to

88
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,640
be left with the same
thing again.

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,430
So if-- let me write this down--
if row i is equal to

90
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,820
row j, then this guy,
then S, the swapped

91
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,760
matrix, is equal to A.

92
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,530
They'll be identical.

93
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,280
You're swapping two rows that
are the same thing.

94
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,510
So that implies a determinant of
the swapped matrix is equal

95
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,830
to the determinant of A.

96
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,250
But we just said, if the swap
matrix, when you swap two

97
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,800
rows, it equals a negative
of the determinant of a.

98
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,140
So this tells us it also has to
equal the negative of the

99
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,910
determinant of A.

100
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,440
So what does that tell us?

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,840
That tells us if A has two rows
that are equal to each

102
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,320
other, if we swap them, we
should get the negative of the

103
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,260
determinant, but if two rows are
equal we're going to get

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,730
the same matrix again.

105
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,270
So if A has two rows that are
equal-- so if row i is equal

106
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,710
to row j-- then the determinant
of A has to be

107
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,770
equal to the negative of
the determinant of A.

108
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,290
We know that because the
determinant of A, or A is the

109
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,710
same thing as the swapped
version of A, and the swapped

110
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,280
version of a has to have the
negative determinant of A.

111
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,200
So these two things
have to be equal.

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,510
Now what number is equal to A
negative version of itself?

113
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,340
If I just told you x is equal
to negative x, what number

114
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,010
does x have to be equal to?

115
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,410
There's only one value that it
could possibly be equal to. x

116
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,850
would have to be equal to 0.

117
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,820
So the takeaway here is, let's
say if you have duplicate

118
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,140
rows-- you can extend this if
you have three or four rows

119
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,330
that are the same-- leads
you to the fact that the

120
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,940
determinant of your
matrix is 0.

121
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,800
And that really shouldn't
be a surprise.

122
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,590
Because if you have duplicate
rows, remember what we learned

123
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,500
a long time ago.

124
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:38,540
We learned that a matrix is an
invertible if and only if the

125
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:45,150
reduced row echelon form
is the identity matrix.

126
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,290
We learned that.

127
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,930
But if you have two duplicate
rows-- let's say these two

128
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,480
guys are equal to each other--
you could perform a row

129
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,250
operation where you replace this
guy with this guy minus

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,085
that guy, and you'll just
get a row of 0's.

131
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,580
And if you get a row of 0's,
you're never going to be able

132
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,450
get the identity matrix.

133
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:15,480
So we know that duplicate rows
could never get reduced row

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,980
echelon form to be
the identity.

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,710
Or, duplicate rows are
not invertible.

136
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,580
   

137
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,350
And we also learned that
something is not invertible if

138
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,335
and only if its determinant
is equal to 0.

139
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:34,240
   

140
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,100
So we now got to the same result
two different ways.

141
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,820
One, we just used some
of what we learned.

142
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,710
When you swap rows, it should
become the negative, but if

143
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,340
you swap the same row, you
shouldn't change the matrix.

144
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,950
So the determinant of
the matrix has to

145
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,400
be the same as itself.

146
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,700
So if you have duplicate rows,
the determinant is 0.

147
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,810
Which isn't something that we
had to use using this little

148
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,140
swapping technique, we could
have gone back to our

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,750
requirements for invertability--
I think was

150
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,040
five or six videos ago.

151
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
But I just wanted to
point that out.

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,970
If you see duplicate rows.

153
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,930
and actually if you see
duplicate columns-- I'll leave

154
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,880
that for you to think about--
if you see duplicate rows or

155
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,840
duplicate columns, or even if
you just see that some rows

156
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,450
are linear combinations of
other rows-- and I'm not

157
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,740
showing that to you right here--
then you know that your

158
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,340
determinant is going
to be equal to 0.

159
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,465
