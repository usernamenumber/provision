1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,240
OK, hopefully, my
tool is working now.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,490
But anyway, so we were saying
when x is equal to minus 0.001,

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,590
so we're getting closer and
closer to 0 from the negative

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,140
side, f of x is equal
to minus 1,000, right?

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,750
You can just evaluate
it yourself, right?

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,800
And as you see, as x approaches
0 from the negative direction,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,590
we get larger and larger-- or I
guess you could say smaller and

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,110
smaller negative
numbers, right?

10
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,690
You get-- you know, if it's
minus 0.0001, you'd get minus

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,730
10,000, and then minus 100,000,
and then minus 1 million, you

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,040
could imagine the closer and
closer you get to zero.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,440
Similarly, when you go from the
other direction, when you say

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,650
what is-- when x is 0.01, there
you get positive 100, right?

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:54,890
When x is point-- the thing is
frozen again-- when it's 0.001,

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,420
you get positive 1,000.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,270
So as you see, as you approach
0 from the negative direction,

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,210
you get larger and larger
negative values, or I guess

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,420
smaller and smaller
negative values.

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,440
And as you go from the positive
direction, you get larger

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,190
and larger values.

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,700
Let me graph this just to give
you a sense of what this graph

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,190
looks like because this is
actually a good graph to know

24
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,320
what it looks like
just generally.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,040
   

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,510
So let's say I have the x-axis.

27
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,530
This is the y-axis.

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,200
   

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,570
Change my color.

30
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,090
So when x is a negative number,
as x gets really, really,

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,320
really negative, as x is like
negative infinity, this

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,890
is approaching zero, but
it's still going to be a

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,330
slightly negative number.

34
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,040
And then as we see from what we
drew, as we approach x is equal

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
to 0, we asymptote, and we
approach negative

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,090
infinity, right?

37
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,850
And similarly, from positive
numbers, if you go out to

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,210
the right really far, it
approaches 0, but it's

39
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,980
still going to be positive.

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,400
And as we gets closer and
closer to 0, it spikes up, and

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,450
it goes to positive infinity.

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,770
You never quite get
x is equal to 0.

43
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,260
So in this situation, you
actually have as x approaches--

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,320
so let me give you a different
notation, which you'll

45
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,380
probably see eventually.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,800
I might actually do a separate
presentation on this.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:28,940
The limit as x approaches 0
from the positive direction,

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:35,180
that's this notation
here, of 1/x, right?

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,260
So this is as x approaches 0
from the positive direction,

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,585
from the right-hand side, well,
this is equal to infinity.

51
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:46,550
   

52
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:56,120
And then the limit as x-- this
pen, this pen-- the limit as x

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,340
approaches 0 from the
negative side of 1/x.

54
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,460
This notation just says
the limit as I approach

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,420
from the negative side.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,120
So as I approach x equal 0 from
this direction, right, from

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
this direction, what happens?

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,530
Well, that is equal
to minus infinity.

59
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,550
   

60
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,110
So since I'm approaching
a different value when I

61
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,500
approach from one side
or the other, this limit

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,130
is actually undefined.

63
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,625
I mean, we could say that from
the positive side, it's

64
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,660
positive infinity, or from the
negative side, it's negative

65
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,310
infinity, but they have to
equal the same thing for

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,800
this limit to be defined.

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,390
So this is equal to undefined.

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,740
   

69
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,590
So let's do another problem,
and I think this should

70
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,810
be interesting now.

71
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,350
So let's say, just keeping that
last problem we had in mind,

72
00:03:48,350 --> 00:04:03,160
what's the limit as x
approaches 0 of 1/x squared?

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,270
So in this situation,
I'll draw the graph.

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,080
   

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,620
That's my x-axis.

76
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,140
That's my y-axis.

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,400
So here, no matter what value
we put into x, we get a

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,560
positive value, right?

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,370
Because you're going
to square it.

80
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:25,360
If you put minus-- you could
actually-- oh, let me do it.

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,830
It'll be instructive, I think.

82
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,940
Once again, obviously you
can't just put x equal to 0.

83
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,330
You'll get 1/0,
which is undefined.

84
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,220
But let's say 1 over x squared.

85
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,400
What does 1 over x
squared evaluate to?

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:46,250
So when x is 0.1, 0.1 squared
is 0.01, so 1/x is 100.

87
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,600
Similarly, if I do minus 0.1,
minus 0.1 squared is positive

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,440
0.01, so then 1 over that
is still 100, right?

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,630
So regardless of whether we put
a negative or positive number

90
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,380
here, we get a positive value.

91
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,070
And similarly, if I put-- if we
say x is 0.01, if you evaluate

92
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:14,540
it, you'll get 10,000, and if
we put minus 0.01, you'll get

93
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,920
positive 10,000 as well, right?

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,420
Because we square it.

95
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,240
So in this graph, if you were
to draw it, and if you have a

96
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,060
graphing calculator, you
should experiment, it

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,720
looks something like this.

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,480
I can see this dark blue.

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,680
So from the negative side, it
approaches infinity, right?

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,180
You can see that.

101
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,000
As we get to smaller and
smaller-- as we get closer and

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,860
closer to 0 from the negative
side, it approaches infinity.

103
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,280
As we go from the positive
side-- these are actually

104
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,050
symmetric, although I didn't
draw it that symmetric-- it

105
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,390
also approaches infinity.

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,780
So this is a case in which
the limit-- oh, that's

107
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,380
not too bright.

108
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,720
I don't know if you can see --
the limit as x approaches 0

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,850
from the negative side of 1
over x squared is equal to

110
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:11,240
infinity, and the limit as x
approaches 0 from the positive

111
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,070
side of 1 over x squared is
also equal to infinity.

112
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,550
So when you go from the
left-hand side, it

113
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,560
equals infinity, right?

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,860
It goes to infinity
as you approach 0.

115
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
And as you go from the
right-hand side, it

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,030
also goes to infinity.

117
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,800
And so the limit in general
is equal to infinity.

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,520
And this is why I got excited
when I first started

119
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,100
learning limits.

120
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,770
Because for the first time,
infinity is a legitimate answer

121
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,950
to your problem, which, I don't
know, on some metaphysical

122
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,660
level got me kind of excited.

123
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,750
But anyway, I will do more
problems in the next

124
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,950
presentation because you can
never do enough limit problems.

125
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,610
And in a couple of
presentations, I actually give

126
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,670
you the formal, kind of
rigorous mathematical

127
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,890
definition of the limits.

128
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,400
