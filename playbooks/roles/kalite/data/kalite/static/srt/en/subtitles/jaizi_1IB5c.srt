1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,330
So we're given the following
equation, that 5 times the

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:09,860
absolute value of x plus 3
minus 3 is equal to 7.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,020
It's always a little daunting
to see an equation with an

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,310
absolute value sign.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,620
And when you only have one of
them, like this, what I like

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,710
to do is isolate it, and just
kind of think it through from

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,290
that point.

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,570
So let's try to isolate
the absolute

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,140
value of x plus 3 here.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,250
Let's try to isolate that
part of our equation.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,960
So the first thing we might want
to do is add 3 to both

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,000
sides of the equation.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,270
That'll get rid of this minus 3,
or this negative 3, on the

15
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,520
left-hand side.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,190
So let's add 3 to both sides
of this equation.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,690
And this'll turn the equation
into-- do it in that same pink

18
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,270
color --the left-hand side
will still be 5 times the

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,810
absolute value of x plus 3.

20
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,280
The minus 3, or the negative
3 plus the 3,

21
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,440
those will cancel out.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,770
That'll just be 0.

23
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:02,230
And then that will be equal
to 7 plus 3, which is 10.

24
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,610
Now, we have 5 times the thing
we want to isolate.

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,380
The best way to isolate it
completely is to divide both

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,030
sides of this equation by 5.

27
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,800
So if you divide that side
by 5, and then the

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,630
right-hand side by 5.

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,390
We divide it by 5 so that these
guys will cancel out.

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,050
5 times something divided by
5 is just that something.

31
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,930
So these cancel out.

32
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,810
That's 2.

33
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,590
So we're left with the absolute
value of x plus 3 is

34
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,860
equal to 10 divided
by 5, which is 2.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,350
So we've simplified the equation
a good bit, now we

36
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,580
just have to put our thinking
caps on a little bit.

37
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,180
If the absolute value of
something is 2, what does it

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,060
mean that that something is?

39
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,620
What are the two numbers that,
if I were take it's absolute

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,805
value, I could get 2.

41
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:53,450
I'll do a little thing
on the side here.

42
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,740
We know that the absolute value
of 2 is equal to 2.

43
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,160
So maybe this thing
was equal to 2.

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,300
So maybe x plus 3
is equal to 2.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,600
If x plus 3 is equal to 2, and
you take its absolute value,

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,150
you're going to get 2 again.

47
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,960
But we also know that the
absolute value of negative 2

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,700
is also equal to 2.

49
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,560
So maybe x plus 3 is equal
to negative 2.

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,480
Because if x plus 3 is equal to
negative 2, and we take its

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,300
absolute value, then we're
going to get 2 again.

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,990
So we could also write or x
plus 3 could be equal to

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,900
negative 2.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,570
That's what I mean
about thinking

55
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,410
about it a little bit.

56
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,280
Another way to think about it--
I've said this in other

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,500
videos --is absolute value
means distance from 0.

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,420
So if we were to draw a number
line here, that is 0, this is

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,420
saying that, whatever this
quantity is inside the

60
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,550
absolute value sign, its
distance from 0 is 2.

61
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,140
So what numbers are
2 away from 0?

62
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,690
Well, you have positive 2.

63
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,640
I'll write a positive
there explicitly.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,500
And you also have
a negative 2.

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,170
So this thing here could be a
positive 2, or it could be a

66
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:09,980
negative 2.

67
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,120
Either way you take the absolute
value of a positive 2

68
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,020
or a negative 2, you're
going to get a 2.

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,980
So let's solve these.

70
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,680
So over here we can subtract
3 from both

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,210
sides of this equation.

72
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:25,670
So if you subtract 3 from both
sides, you get-- The left-hand

73
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,250
side, you're just
left with an x.

74
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,650
These 3's cancel out.

75
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,105
That's the whole point
of subtracting the 3.

76
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:36,060
x will be equal to 2 minus
3 is negative 1.

77
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,580
So that is one solution to our
absolute value equation.

78
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,560
And what's our other solution?

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,450
Well here, once again, let's
subtract 3 from both sides.

80
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,540
So you subtract 3
from both sides.

81
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,520
The left-hand side just
becomes an x.

82
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,200
The right-hand side, negative
2 minus 3 is negative 5.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,000
So this is our other solution.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,570
And let's verify that
they both work.

85
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,640
So if x is equal to negative
1, what does

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,370
this equation become?

87
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,320
We have 5 times the absolute
value of negative 1

88
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,060
plus 3 minus 3.

89
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,790
And if this really is a
solution, then this should be

90
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,600
equal to positive 7.

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,899
So let's see.

92
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,700
This is 5 times negative
1 plus 3 is 2.

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,510
So it's 5 times the absolute
value of 2 minus 3.

94
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,920
The absolute value
of 2 is just 2.

95
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,670
So this is 5 times 2 minus 3.

96
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:43,740
5 times 2 is 10 minus 3, which
is, indeed, equal to 7.

97
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,030
So this is definitely
a solution.

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,110
Let's try the other one out.
x is equal to negative 5.

99
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,320
Running out of some real estate,
but I could clear some

100
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,090
up right here.

101
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,570
If x is equal to negative
5, same drill.

102
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:03,900
5 times the absolute value of
negative 5 plus 3 minus 3.

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,300
This again should
be equal to 7.

104
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,480
Negative 5 plus 3
is negative 2.

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,110
Since there's 5 times the
absolute value of negative 2

106
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,970
minus 3, the absolute value of
negative 2 is positive 2.

107
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:24,840
So this is 5 times 2 minus 3,
which is 10 minus 3, which is

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,110
again equal to 7.

109
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,580
And notice, in this situation,
the thing in the absolute

110
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,260
value sign became a negative 2,
because we said, oh, x plus

111
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,960
3 could be equal
to negative 2.

112
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,940
In the magenta situation, the
thing in the absolute value

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,690
sign was positive 2, because
this was a situation where we

114
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,760
assumed that the thing in the
absolute value sign was a

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,950
positive 2.

116
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,910
Now if we were to graph these
solutions on the number line,

117
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,380
if we were to graph the two
solutions on a number line--

118
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,580
I'll draw a new number
line here.

119
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,510
Let me draw a new number
line, just like that.

120
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,910
Both of these are less than
0, so I'll put 0 all

121
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,520
the way over here.

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,050
Maybe 0, 1, 2.

123
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,820
Let's go negative, negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

124
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,320
negative 4, negative
5, negative 6.

125
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,100
This solution right here-- x
is equal to negative 1 --we

126
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,450
could plot on the number
line right over there.

127
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,650
And then the other solution-- x
is equal to negative 5 --we

128
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,430
can plot it right over there.

129
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,980
Hopefully you found
that enjoyable.

130
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,266
