1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,680
In the last video, I told you
that pressure times volume is

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,370
a constant.

5
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,660
That if you increase the
pressure-- or if you increase

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,380
the volume, you're going to
decrease the pressure.

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,250
Hopefully, you got an
intuitive sense why.

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,150
Or likewise, if you squeezed the
balloon, or the box, and

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,100
there are no openings there,
then the pressure within the

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,540
box would increase.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,340
With that said, let's see if we
can do a couple of fairly

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,995
typical problems that
you'll see.

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,299
So let's say that I have
a box, or a balloon, or

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,775
something, and it has a volume,
and so let me call

15
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,025
this the initial volume.

16
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:40,980
   

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,540
My initial volume is 50 cubic
meters, and my initial

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,730
pressure is 500 pascals.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,620
Just so you remember,
what's a pascal?

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,655
That's 500 newtons
per meter cubed.

21
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:08,160
   

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,260
I take that box, or balloon, or
whatever, and I compress it

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,770
down to 20 meters cubed.

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,020
So I compress it, so I squeeze
it-- that was the first

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,340
example that I gave last time.

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,620
It was the same container,
and I squeeze it down

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,720
to 20 meters cubed.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,540
What's going to be
the new pressure?

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,500
You should immediately have an
intuition-- what happens when

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,610
you squeeze a balloon?

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,180
It becomes harder to do it.

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:43,970
   

33
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,550
What's going to be
the new pressure?

34
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,690
It's definitely going to be
higher-- when you decrease the

35
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,470
volume, the pressure increases
are inversely related.

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,670
The pressure's going to go up,
and let's see if we can

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,930
calculate it.

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,250
We know that P1 times v1 is
equal to some constant, and

39
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,540
since we have no aggregate
change in energy-- I'm just

40
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,970
telling you that the box is
squeezed, I'm not telling you

41
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,010
whether it did any work, or
anything like that-- the same

42
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,620
constant is going to be equal to
the new pressure times the

43
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,840
new volume, which is equal
to P2 times V2.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,620
You could just have the general
relationship: P1 times

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,000
V1 is equal to P2 times V2,
assuming that no work was

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,830
done, and there was no exchange
of energy from

47
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,240
outside of the system.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,650
In most of these cases, when you
see this on an exam, that

49
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
is the case.

50
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,140
The old pressure was 500 pascals
times 50 meters cubed.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:51,960
One thing to keep in mind,
because this equivalence is

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,430
not equal, and we're not saying
it has to equal some

53
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,280
necessary absolute number--
for example, we don't know

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,160
exactly what this K is, although
we could figure it

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,270
out right now-- as long as
you're using one unit for

56
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,070
pressure on this side, and one
unit for volume on this side,

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,330
you just have to use
the same units.

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,620
We could have done this same
exact problem the exact same

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,460
way, if instead of meters cubed,
they said liters, as

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,430
long as we had liters here.

61
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,120
You just have to make sure
you're using the same units on

62
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,090
both sides.

63
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,860
In this case, we have 500
pascals as the pressure, and

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,950
the volume is 50 meters cubed.

65
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,260
That's going to be equal to the
new pressure, P2, times

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,840
the new volume, 20
meters cubed.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,090
Let's see what we can do: we can
divide both sides by 10,

68
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,880
so we can take the 10 out of
there, and we could divide

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,440
both sides by 2, so that
becomes a 250.

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:56,520
We we get 250 times 5 is equal
to P2, and so P2 is equal to

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,680
1250 pascals, and if we kept
with the units, you

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,620
would have seen that.

73
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:09,590
When I decreased the volume
by roughly 60%, I have the

74
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,950
pressure actually increased by
2 1/2, so that gels with what

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,519
we talked about before.

76
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,500
Let's add another variable into
this mix-- let's talk

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,120
about temperature.

78
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,450
Like pressure, volume, work, and
a lot of concepts that we

79
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,780
talk about in physics,
temperature is something that

80
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,545
you probably are at least
reasonably familiar with.

81
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,800
   

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,260
How do you view temperature?

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,390
A high temperature means
something is hot, and a low

84
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,590
temperature means something is
cold, and I think that also

85
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,690
gives you intuition that a
higher temperature object has

86
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,940
more energy.

87
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,580
   

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:04,380
The sun has more energy than an
ice cube-- I think that's

89
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,350
fair enough.

90
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,620
I think you also have the sense
that-- what would have

91
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,830
more energy?

92
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:33,890
A 100 degree cup of tea, or a
100 degree barrel of tea.

93
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,950
I want to make them equivalent
in terms of

94
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,440
what they're holding.

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,400
I think you have a sense.

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,450
Even though they're the same
temperature, they're both

97
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,390
pretty warm-- let's say this
is 100 degrees Celsius, so

98
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,800
they're both boiling-- that the
barrel, because there's

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,070
more of it, is going to
have more energy.

100
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,090
It's equally hot, and there's
just more molecules there.

101
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,620
That's what temperature is.

102
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:04,200
Temperature, in general, is a
measure roughly equal to some

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,440
constant times the kinetic
energy-- the average kinetic

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,950
energy-- per molecule.

105
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:21,570
   

106
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,720
So the average kinetic energy
of the system divided by the

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,570
total number of molecules we
have. Another way we could

108
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,690
talk about is, temperature is

109
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,230
essentially energy per molecule.

110
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,600
So something that has a lot of
molecules, where N is the

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,160
number of molecules.

112
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,270
Another way we could view this
is that the kinetic energy of

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,840
the system is going to be
equal to the number of

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,170
molecules times the
temperature.

115
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,960
This is just a constant-- times
1 over K, but we don't

116
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,430
even know what this is, so we
could say that's still a

117
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,910
constant-- so the kinetic energy
of the system is going

118
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,680
to be equal to some constant
times the number of particles

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,170
times temperature.

120
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,300
We don't know what this
is, and we're going to

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,710
figure this out later.

122
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,410
This is another interesting
concept.

123
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,780
We said that pressure times
volume is proportional to the

124
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,710
kinetic energy of the system--
the aggregate, if you take all

125
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,080
of the molecules and combine
their kinetic energies.

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,230
These aren't the same K's-- I
could put another constant

127
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,960
here and call that K1.

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,280
And we also know that the
kinetic energy of the system

129
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:44,980
is equal to some other constant
times the number of

130
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,700
molecules I have times
the temperature.

131
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,010
If you think about it, you could
also say that this is

132
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,480
proportional to this, and this
is proportional to this.

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,900
You could say that pressure
times volume is proportional

134
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,890
to the number-- and these are
all different proportional

135
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,540
constants, and we'll figure
out this exact constant

136
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,630
later-- so we could say that
pressure times volume is

137
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,460
proportional to molecules we
have, times temperature.

138
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,080
And we said that we can
view temperature

139
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,580
as energy per molecule.

140
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,940
Another way we could say is
that if this constant is

141
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,230
constant, which is by
definition, and the number of

142
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,090
molecules is constant-- we
have PV over temperature.

143
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,380
Pressure times volume over
temperature is going to be

144
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,620
equal to something times the
number of molecules, so we

145
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,880
could say that's some other
constant, like k4.

146
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,370
This is another interesting
thing to think about: we said

147
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,320
pressure times volume is equal
to pressure times volume, and

148
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,980
now we added temperature
into the mix.

149
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:49,840
   

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,880
We could say P1 times V1
over T1 is equal to P2

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,010
times V2 over T2.

152
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,050
Does this make sense to you?

153
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:11,120
What happens if I have another
box, and I have my particles

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,370
bouncing around like always.

155
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,080
I have some volume, and some
amount of pressure-- what

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,730
happens when the temperature
goes up?

157
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,720
What am I saying?

158
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,990
I'm saying that the average
kinetic energy per molecule is

159
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,270
going to go up, so they're going
to bounce against the

160
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,390
walls more.

161
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,930
If they bounce against the walls
more, the pressure's

162
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,290
going to go up, assuming
volume stays flat.

163
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,710
   

164
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,420
Another way you could think
about it-- let's say the

165
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:50,890
temperature goes up, and the
pressure stays flat.

166
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,730
So what did I have to do?

167
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,380
I just said if the temperature
goes up, the average kinetic

168
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,230
energy of each molecule--
they'll bounce more.

169
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,390
In order to make them bounce
against the sides of the walls

170
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,170
as often, I'd have to
increase the volume.

171
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,520
If you hold pressure constant,
the only way you can do that

172
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,620
is by increasing the volume
while you increase the

173
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,840
temperature.

174
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,230
Let's keep this in mind, and we
will use this to solve some

175
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,010
pretty typical problems
in the next video.
