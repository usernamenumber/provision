We're asked to evaluate the expression a squared plus ten b minus eight when a is equal to seven and b is equal to negative four.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,267
So to evaluate the expression we really just need to substitute a with 7 and substitute b with negative 4.

3
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:24,133
Because they are saying evaluate it when a is seven and b is negative four. So let's do that.

4
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:29,400
So everywhere we see an a in the expression we should put a seven there. So instead of a squared

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:42,267
we should write seven squared plus ten times b. But instead of a b there we are

6
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:50,400
now going to substitute it with b is equal to negative four. So ten times negative four instead of the

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,533
b right over there. And then we have the minus eight. And now we just have to evaluate this thing.

8
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:07,467
Seven squared is forty-nine. And then ten times negative four, remember order of operations.

9
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,400
Multiplication comes before addition so we have to multiply this. Ten times negative four is

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:22,000
negative forty. So it's plus negative forty, and then we have minus eight over here.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,933
And so we get forty-nine plus negative forty, which is the same thing as forty-nine minus forty, is going

12
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:35,000
to be nine. Then we're going to subtract eight from that. And so we get one.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,600
Forty-nine minus forty is nine, and minus eight is one. We are done.

14
00:01:40,600 --> 99:59:59,999
We have evaluated the expression when a is equal to seven and b is equal to negative four.
