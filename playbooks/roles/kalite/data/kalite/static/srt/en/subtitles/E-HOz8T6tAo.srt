1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's learn a little bit about just

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,770
how a plain vanilla bank works.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,980
So let's say that I'm an entrepreneur

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,580
and I see a problem out there in the world.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,320
You have all of these hardworking people

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,907
-- whatever they do-- doctors, lawyers, engineers, construction workers--

7
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:18,840
whatever they might do.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,890
They work, they provide services to each other

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,350
and they have savings, right?

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,160
So right now, they're just-- whatever.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,916
They're burying it in their backyards.

12
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,260
And they're just collecting there, right?

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,248
That "money" is doing nothing.

14
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:40,940
They've provided some goods and services to someone else.

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,141
Those people gave them something,

16
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:48,280
whether it's gold or a green piece of paper, that essentially says,

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,910
this gold or this green piece of paper entitles you

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,550
to some future goods and services.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,100
And those people said, that's a useful thing that I have.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,440
Let me just put it into my mattress.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,910
There's this pool of savings

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,425
and let's say there's this other pool of entrepreneurs

23
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:10,810
and they have a bunch of really good ideas for projects.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,910
They're like, you know what?

25
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,590
If I could just to get-- let me put this here:

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:25,730
projects or investments.

27
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,410
Let's say that there's some other entrepreneur

28
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,870
and he says, boy, you know what?

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,580
I have no claims on any goods and resources,

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,900
but I have an idea.

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,263
I have an idea that

32
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:40,232
if I could get a bunch of people to dig canals to the crops,

33
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:43,257
that we'll be able to grow more crops throughout the year

34
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:46,481
and we'll all be richer because we'll all have more food

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,270
and that's a true good and service in its best sense.

36
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,947
But how am I going to get these people

37
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,920
to build this ditch for me?

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,310
I mean, I could maybe promise them in the future

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,900
that once all of this is done, I can do something,

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,770
give them more food, but that's not the way it works.

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,510
No one's willing to work for me unless they can feel very secure

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,500
that they're going to get something in return.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,580
So we have an interesting problem here.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,515
You have a bunch of people

45
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:15,561
who have already provided goods and services to the world

46
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,304
and the world has given them trinkets--

47
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,610
whether it's gold coins or paper money. Let's just say it's gold, right?

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,335
And I want to make this point

49
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:27,232
because everyone always talks about gold as if it's something special,

50
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:30,185
as if it really represents wealth,

51
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,770
while paper money really does not represent wealth.

52
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,809
And that's just not true.

53
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:34,990
There's nothing about gold.

54
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,900
Gold is not useful other than the fact that it is pretty.

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,700
That's the only thing that makes gold useful.

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,360
Actually, it's pretty and it's hard to counterfeit.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,380
Paper money-- not so pretty, but it has other advantages.

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,541
It's lighter, and at least the paper money we use now,

59
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,720
is not so easy to counterfeit.

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,070
I always want to make that--people always somehow feel

61
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,300
that gold is somehow better than paper money.

62
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,060
And we'll talk in the future about inflation and deflation

63
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,701
and the fact that there is a constraint

64
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,800
on how much gold can be produced, but you can print money.

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
But we'll talk about that in a little bit.

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,748
So in our modern world

67
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:13,263
that savings are these green pieces of paper,

68
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:17,090
but let's say we're talking about some primitive culture and they're using gold.

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,930
So a bunch of people perform a bunch of goods and services

70
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,060
and they get these little coins.

71
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,420
And these coins are essentially this society's way of agreeing--

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,160
if you have one of these coins in the future,

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,202
if you give this coin to someone else,

74
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,478
they'll do something for you.

75
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,420
And how much of that coin you have to give

76
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,005
for them to do it?

77
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:38,880
It's based on supply and demand and price, whatever.

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,883
These projects-- I say, well

79
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:46,573
if I only had some way of convincing someone to dig a canal,

80
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,960
it would be hugely beneficial and it will create wealth--

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,630
or dig irrigation ditches.

82
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,600
But how do I do that?

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, if I had gold or if I had these little coins,

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,189
I could give these coins to these people,

85
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,105
they would dig the irrigation ditch

86
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:05,889
and then I could charge people the service of using my--

87
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,823
or maybe I'll charge people access to water

88
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:12,290
and then I could essentially generate a return. But how do I do that?

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,450
Well, what if I could borrow some of these people, right?

90
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,500
These people have these units of goods and services

91
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,209
called a gold coin.

92
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,194
If I could borrow some of their money

93
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:30,670
and use it to pay people that will essentially do the goods and service

94
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,750
or do the new project, then I'll generate wealth.

95
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,060
And then I could share it with these people,

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,660
maybe in the form of some type of interest.

97
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,115
Well, it's very hard in a vacuum

98
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,600
for these people to evaluate these projects.

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,458
And maybe these projects,

100
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,099
they don't require just part of the savings of one person,

101
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:53,755
they require the savings of 1,000 people because it's
a large project.

102
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:55,341
It's also hard for these people

103
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:58,660
to evaluate who has a good project.

104
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,920
It's hard for these people to evaluate who has savings.

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,924
In fact, if I have savings,

106
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:07,270
if I've buried a bunch of stuff in my backyard or in my
mattress,

107
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,240
I don't want to advertise it.

108
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,850
That's just going to make people come and rob me.

109
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,695
So I'm a third entrepreneur and I see an opportunity for business

110
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,110
and I call that business a bank.

111
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,970
And so what is a bank going to do?

112
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,590
What is my bank going to do?

113
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's just talk about it from the bare bones.

114
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,470
How am I going to start my business?

115
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,290
I'm actually one of these entrepreneurs.

116
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,878
Let's say I have some savings,

117
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,910
just to make it simple so I don't have to go into this pool.

118
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,130
So let's say I have a million gold coins of savings--

119
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,200
let's say it's a million dollars.

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:48,652
Let me draw my balance sheet.

121
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,907
And balance sheets, as you see,

122
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:54,370
they were useful even in primitive cultures.

123
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,127
So that's my balance sheet.

124
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:08,518
Let's say my initial balance sheet is--

125
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:19,618
I put in a million dollars of my gold coins.

126
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,087
I'll say a million dollars

127
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,418
just because we're used to that.

128
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,180
You could say a gold coin is worth a dollar,

129
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,160
so it's a million gold coins.

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,340
We know that that's not true anymore.

131
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:37,658
And I use that essentially to build this big structure of solid stone

132
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:40,600
that looks really safe and really secure.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,520
So I use it essentially just to build a big vault, right?

134
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,988
So this is my equity, right, and I use it to build a vault--

135
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,260
a big, nice, fancy looking building.

136
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,750
So I'll actually draw the building.

137
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,583
It has pillars in the front.

138
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:04,690
It looks like an old Greek or Roman temple.

139
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,200
I think that's not an accidental appearance.

140
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,670
So I build this nice looking building

141
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,450
that people would feel comfortable keeping their money in--

142
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,990
and that could actually be safe for safekeeping.

143
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,950
And I tell everyone, look, I have this nice big building.

144
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,970
Instead of having your money insecure in your backyard or your bed,

145
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,240
why don't you put your savings in this building

146
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,350
and if you ever need it, you can come and get it?

147
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,158
And on top of that,

148
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,490
I'm going to pay you to keep your money with me.

149
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,390
So everyone says, that's a good deal and Sal's trustworthy

150
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,344
and, more than Sal, that building looks even more trustworthy

151
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:41,990
because it looks like a Greek temple.

152
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,910
So everyone puts their savings with me.

153
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,891
And let's say that is

154
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:54,440
that is $10 million of savings in my village.

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,450
I have a fairly wealthy village.

156
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,780
So that's $10 million of deposits.

157
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,460
This is a liability for me, right?

158
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,360
Why is it a liability?

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,740
Because I owe that to other people.

160
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,630
They're giving it to me for safekeeping.

161
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,495
So this is my liabilities.

162
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:13,980
This is my equity.

163
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,070
If it wasn't just me, if there was 10 shareholders,

164
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,780
each of us would have 1/10 of this.

165
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,740
But this is a sole proprietorship

166
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,420
so this is my equity.

167
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,780
This is my building.

168
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm running a business here, right?

169
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,060
I'm not doing this

170
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,290
as some type of nonprofit or charity work.

171
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,950
So what am I going to do with this $10 million of deposits?

172
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,389
Well, I told people

173
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,549
that they can take the money out any time.

174
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,980
I'm taking their money as safekeeping.

175
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,409
If they put it in and then one day they can't get their money back,

176
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,130
they're going to be very suspicious of me.

177
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,430
So I have to keep some of the money set aside.

178
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,370
This could be amongst 3,000 or 4,000 people.

179
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,485
So at any given day,

180
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,116
not everyone-- hopefully not everyone's--

181
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:52,890
going to pull their money out or put their money in.

182
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,173
But I need to keep some cash reserves

183
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:58,290
in case people want their money back.

184
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,000
So I need to keep some of that $10 million in cash.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
So let me do that in magenta.

186
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,100
Let me say I want to keep 10% of it in cash.

187
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,490
So I'm going to keep $1 million in cash

188
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,774
and then I have $9 million left

189
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:19,290
that I can hopefully put to productive use.

190
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,139
And what I'd do with that $9 million is

191
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,990
I loan it out to people who have really good projects or investments.

192
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,330
So $9 million in loans.

193
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,440
That's an asset, right?

194
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,590
I give that money to someone else.

195
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,670
They owe me $9 million.

196
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,260
I'm essentially borrowing $10 million,

197
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,080
keeping $1 million aside, and paying out $9 million in loans.

198
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,140
There could be a bunch of different projects.

199
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,100
There could be 100.

200
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm not just giving $9 million to one person.

201
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,917
I'm diversifying a bunch

202
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,150
across a bunch of different projects.

203
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,600
So the natural question is, how am I making money?

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Well, these loans-- I'm hopefully putting them

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,160
to build irrigation ditches or build factories or do whatever,

206
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,340
something that actually is an investment,

207
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,950
that creates more value than it needed to start up.

208
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,420
So I can actually charge interest

209
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,110
and that interest should be a cut of that value that's being created.

210
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,720
So let's say that I charge 10% on this money.

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,431
And just for the sake of it,

212
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:19,110
let's say I invest really well and no one defaults.

213
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,300
I'm the first bank so I get all of the best investments.

214
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,070
So I'm getting 10%.

215
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,030
And for their money, these people,

216
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,756
not only do they get to keep their money in this nice, safe deposit,

217
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:35,468
but I'm also paying them 5%.

218
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,520
So how much money do I make in a year?

219
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Well, I'm making 10% on this $9 million.

220
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,667
So what is that?

221
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:51,150
That's $900,000 a year I'm bringing in.

222
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,480
And how much am I paying out every year?

223
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,130
Well, 5% of $10 million--I'm paying out $500,000.

224
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,280
So interest income-- $900,000.

225
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,120
Interest expense-- $500,000.

226
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,900
That nets me $400,000.

227
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,369
And let's say I pay another $100,000

228
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,670
for salaries and for security guards and all of that.

229
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,940
So essentially, I'm netting $300,000.

230
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,990
So I'm netting $300,000.

231
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,140
I'll do it in a little more detail in the next video.

232
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,900
But if you look at it big picture,

233
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,934
I put a million dollars in and every year,

234
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,644
I'm making $300,000 by providing this service--

235
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:30,500
by matching up the savings with good investments.

236
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,710
And everyone benefits.

237
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,675
The pie's getting bigger because these are real investments

238
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:36,810
that are going to benefit my village.

239
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,079
And of course, these people benefit

240
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,462
because they get safekeeping for their accounts

241
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,610
and their money is actually growing.

242
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,790
They're actually participating in this capital investment.

243
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,160
Anyway, see you in the next video.
