99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What we will attempt to start to do in this video is to take the surface integral

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the function x squared over our surface where the surface

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in question--the surface we're going to care about is going

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be the unit sphere, so it could be defined by x squared

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plus y squared plus z squared is equal to 1

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what we're going to focus on in this first video, because it will take us several videos to do it

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is just the parameterization of this surface area right here

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as you'll see this is often the hardest part

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it takes a little bit of visualization

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then after that it's just kind of mechanical,

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it can be kind of hairy at the same time so it's worth going through

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So first let's just think about how we can parameterize

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I have trouble even saying the word,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how we can parameterize this unit sphere as a function of

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two parameters

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's think about it, let's think about it a little bit

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so first let's just think about, let's just think about

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the unit sphere

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm gonna take a side view of the unit sphere,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's take the unit sphere, so this right over here is

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
our z axis

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's our z axis, and then over here I'm gonna draw

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to be not just the x or the y axis,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is going to be our entire xy plane viewed from the side

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That is the xy plane.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, our sphere, our sphere, our unit sphere might look

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something like this

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The unit sphere itself is not too hard to visualize

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It might look something like that

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The radius at any point is 1

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That length right over there is 1,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is a sphere, not just a circle

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I could even shade it in a little bit just to make it

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
clear that this thing has some dimensionality to it

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's shading it in it just makes it kind of look a

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
little more spherical.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's just attempt to parameterize it, and the first

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
step, let's just think, if we didn't have to think above and

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
below the xy plane, if we just thought about where this

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
unit sphere intersected the xy plane, how we could

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
parameterize that.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just think about where it intersects the xy plane

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it intersects it there, and there, and actually everywhere

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it instersects it everywhere.
