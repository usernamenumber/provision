1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm actually gonna take a step back, clear out some of these stuff,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You've understood the first half of how this process of atherosclerosis happens,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're gonna finish off the second half.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So all of the action is still gonna happen in the tunica intima.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they're much --is gonna stay the same.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so far we've talked about macrophages,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we talked about how they form foam cells,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they --they eat up all the fats,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then form this kind of lake of fat.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, let me --let me leave it there,

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's where the picture's out so far.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And now, let's talk about what happens after that.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the next step, step five, is

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
basically what happen with smooth muscle cells.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
smooth muscle cells.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We haven't talked about them so far.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
smooth muscle cells.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they (..) or they dance over --let's write dance~ over to tunica intima.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So really, again, everything is happening in the tunica intima.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right, you can see that.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's all the action is.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So when I say they dance over them,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm being a little bit silly,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but basically what happen is that these red smooth muscle cells,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these are the smooth muscle cells,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
smooth muscle.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They are gonna start migrating.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They're gonna start migrating or moving.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they're gonna start migrating into the space,

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe that one will go over there,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe this one go over here, perhaps this one.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And why these start kind of migrating is that,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, there's a lot of actions going on,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the macrophages are there, you got the LDL in that lake of fat.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And a lot of chemicals are being released by these cells.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so they sense that something's happening.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they can move over there.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What they begin to do is make a fibrous cap.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's step six.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they make a fibrous cap --actually let me

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
--let me write who makes it.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's very clear: smooth muscle cells, S-N-C.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Smooth muscle cells make a fibrous cap.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what a fibrous cap is? It's--

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Think about when you're really young and you're playing,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you know, you never really pay attention in fellow a lot,

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you might've come home with skinned knees.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I (..) my mom always remarks on that.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And those skinned knees turned into scab, right?

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so these smooth muscle cells made fibrous caps.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Basiclally, think of it as a scab.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A scab that formed over this lake of fat.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I've been drawing for you this yellow lake of fat,

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now, these smooth muscle cells, they coming and say,

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"well, you know, we've gotta make a cap over this thing".

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me erase again, and draw for you what that might look like.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's say that this lake is getting bigger

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This lake over time is ...
