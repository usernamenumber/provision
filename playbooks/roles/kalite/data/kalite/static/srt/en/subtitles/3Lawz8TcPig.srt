1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,336
We're in Museo del Prado, in Madrid, and we're looking at Goya's black paintings.

2
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,440
Yeah, we're in a room filled with them.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,959
They had been the paintings that he had made to decorate his home just outside of Madrid.

4
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:21,527
Literally they've been painted all on the walls. And we're looking at one of the most striking of these panels,

5
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:26,102
Saturn, sometimes referred to as Saturn Devouring One of His Children.

6
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:31,144
It has been prophesized to Saturn that one of his sons would dethrone him.

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:40,464
Saturn is the god of time. So, in order to prevent that occurence Saturn devours his children as they are born.

8
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:45,734
But one escapes, Jupiter. So, Saturn in the end is dethroned

9
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:52,019
and he can't escape the fate that's been allotted to him. In fact, one could argue that he causes his fate

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:58,100
by trying to reverse it. So it's this terrible story, rendered in the most horrific way possible

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,737
and it's a reminder that this is an allegory for the ideas that Goya was thinking about at this moment.

12
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:13,586
Of power, and the way in which a power treats its own children, its own charges, in order to stay in power

13
00:01:13,586 --> 00:01:19,392
Goya had seen the Spanish state, the Spanish monarchy destroy the country.

14
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:22,792
Well then he saw Napolean's army destroy the country.

15
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:26,951
And then he saw the restoration of the monarchy destroy the country.

16
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:32,726
And so this notion of the cyclical nature of time, the notion of turning on one's own charges,

17
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,918
turning on ones own children,

18
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:40,323
but here rendered allegorically, but in the most vivid and I cannot imagine more powerful manner.

19
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:44,728
In one way I read Saturn's bulging eyes and his grasping hands

20
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:53,639
and his sort of frenetic gestures (desperation) in one way as "I'm not going to lose my power,"

21
00:01:53,639 --> 00:02:01,825
but on the other hand, I also feels like he knows he must do this, and he's aware of how terrible it is,

22
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:10,788
and does it in this insane, chaotic, frenzied way. He is, as Goya has rendered him, almost dissolving.

23
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:19,750
You can see his basic anatomy of course, but look at his right elbow, and the way in the skin sort of wraps around,

24
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,764
and his forearm almost dissolves. His shoulder begins to dissolve.

25
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:28,444
We can see his thighs, and they begin to pick up the light.

26
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:33,678
But then there seems to be some extra piece of him, just above let's see his left hip.

27
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:39,258
And so there is this way in which his insanity is in a sense, he's coming apart.

28
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:43,632
And there's this interest in rendering the meat of the body,

29
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:52,160
the flesh of the body in all of its violence, in all of its physicality, in all of its grotesqueness.

30
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,047
Well I think the word, "flesh," is right.

31
00:02:55,047 --> 00:03:01,125
There's something about his own body that looks like meat, like butchered meat.

32
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,973
And at the same time that he is butchering and eating his own son.

33
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:11,321
This is the result of what Goya witnessed. This is Goya's reflection of the world that he saw.

34
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,494
And his understanding of humanity and what it was capable of.
