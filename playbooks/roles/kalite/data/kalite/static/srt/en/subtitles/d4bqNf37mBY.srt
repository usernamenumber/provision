1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,560
We have a situation here
where we have a

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,550
four meter cubed container.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,275
Let's say that's a balloon
of some sort.

5
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:10,072
And instead of having just one
type of molecule of gas in

6
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:13,130
this container, we have three
molecules of gas.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,660
We have some oxygen molecules,
some hydrogen molecules, and

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,480
some nitrogen molecules.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,260
And what the problem tells
us is, we have 2.1 total

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,040
kilograms of gas.

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,690
An of that, by math, 30.48% is
oxygen, 2.86% is hydrogen

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,870
molecules, and 66.67%
is nitrogen.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,670
So what we need to figure,
and it's all at standard

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,450
temperature at least. It's zero
degrees Celsius, which we

15
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,870
know is 273 Kelvin.

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,000
But we need to figure out what
is the total pressure in the

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,290
container, or being exerted on
the surface of the container?

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,520
And then, this is a new concept,
we want to figure out

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,830
the partial pressures of
each of these gases.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,080
Essentially, how much are each
of these gases contributing to

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,820
the total pressure?

22
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,280
And you can imagine, if this
is a container and each of

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,970
these are the three types of
gases, some of the pressure is

24
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,320
going to be from the blue, maybe
oxygen is the blue gas,

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,440
from the blue gas bumping
into the walls.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,490
Some of the pressure is going
to be from the hydrogen

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,630
bumping into the walls, maybe
that's this yellow gas, and

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,370
some of the pressure is going
to be from the nitrogen

29
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,880
bumping into the walls.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,130
Let's say that's
the brown gas.

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,620
   

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,820
So the partial pressure due to
nitrogen, that's the pressure

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,970
just due to the brown particles
bumping into walls.

34
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,250
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

35
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,687
So the first thing to figuring
the total pressure is, we have

36
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:35,920
to figure out the total moles of
molecules we have. And the

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
easiest way I can figure out to
figure out the total number

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,510
of moles is to figure
out the moles of

39
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,150
each of these molecules.

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:49,590
So if we have 2.1 kilograms of
gas-- let me write this down--

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,510
If we want to know moles
of nitrogen.

42
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,020
Let me do it in the
nitrogen color.

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,680
   

44
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,270
We know that 66.67% of this, we
could say 2.1 kilograms or

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,730
2100 grams, we know that
that's nitrogen.

46
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,229
So let's do it in grams. Because
when we talk about

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,030
molecular mass it's always in
grams. It doesn't have to be.

48
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,570
But it makes it a lot simpler to
convert between atomic mass

49
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,630
units and mass in our world.

50
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:28,240
So this is 2/3 of 2100, that's
1400 grams of N2.

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,780
Now what's the molar mass of
this nitrogen molecule?

52
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,460
Well we know that the atomic
mass of nitrogen is 14.

53
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,900
So this molecule has
two nitrogens.

54
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,130
So its atomic mass is 28.

55
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,760
So one of these molecules
will have a mass of

56
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,610
28 atomic mass units.

57
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:53,970
Or one mole of N2 would have
a mass of 28 grams.

58
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,470
So one mole is 28 grams. We have
1400 grams-- or we say

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,230
grams per mole, if we want
to keep our units right.

60
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,750
So if we say 1400 total grams
so divided by 28 grams per

61
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,160
mole we should get the
number of moles.

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,592
So 1400 divided by 28
is equal to 50.

63
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,770
That worked out nicely.

64
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,730
So we have 50 moles of N2.

65
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,980
We could write that
right there.

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,250
   

67
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:32,750
All right.

68
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,790
Let's do oxygen next.

69
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,150
So we do the same process
over again.

70
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,290
30% is oxygen.

71
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,060
So let's do oxygen
down here, O2.

72
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,700
So we take 30%.

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,680
Remember, these percentages
I gave you, these are the

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,950
percentages of the total
mass, not the

75
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,990
percentage of the moles.

76
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,140
So we have to figure out
what the moles are.

77
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:12,970
So 30.48% of 2100 grams
is equal to about 640.

78
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,680
Let's round off.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,390
So this is equal to 640 grams.

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,980
And then what is the
mass of one mole of

81
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,600
the oxygen gas molecule?

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,830
The atomic mass of one
oxygen atom is 16.

83
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,590
You can look it up on the
periodic table, although you

84
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,240
should probably be pretty
familiar with it by now.

85
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,990
So the atomic mass of
this molecule is

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,580
32 atomic mass units.

87
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,830
So one mole of O2 is going to
be 32 grams. We have 640

88
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,020
grams. So how many
moles do we have?

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,040
640 divided by 32
is equal to 20.

90
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,200
We have 20 moles of oxygen.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,020
Let me write that down.

92
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,840
We have 20 moles.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,020
Now we just have to figure
out the hydrogen.

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,690
2.86% of all that is hydrogen.

95
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,520
So let's see, if we do 2100
grams, remember I want to do

96
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,270
everything in grams, so
I just want to do a

97
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,810
unit conversion there.

98
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:26,300
2100 grams times 2.86% is
equal to about 60 grams.

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:34,710
So hydrogen, this 2% of that
2100 grams is 60 grams. And

100
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,540
then what's the molar mass
of one hydrogen.

101
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,470
That's H2.

102
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,210
So we know that the hydrogen
atom by itself has a mass of

103
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,170
1, doesn't have a neutron
in most cases.

104
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,750
So the atomic mass
of this is 2.

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,170
Or the molar mass of
this is 2 grams.

106
00:05:52,170 --> 00:06:00,360
So one mole of H2 is equal to
two grams. We have 60 grams.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,570
So we clearly have 60 divided
by 2, we have 30 moles.

108
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,890
So this is interesting, even
though hydrogen was a super

109
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,450
small fraction of the total mass
of the gas that we have

110
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,290
inside of the container, we
actually have more actual

111
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,460
particles, more actual molecules
of hydrogen than we

112
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
do of oxygen.

113
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,720
That's because each molecule of
hydrogen only has an atomic

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,070
mass of 2 atomic mass units,
while each molecule of oxygen

115
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,200
has 32 because there's two
oxygen atoms. So already we're

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,310
seeing we actually have more
particles due to hydrogen than

117
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,440
due to oxygen.

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,760
And the particles are what
matter, not the mass, when we

119
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,740
talk about part pressure
and partial pressure.

120
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,510
So the first thing we can think
about is how many total

121
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,610
moles of gas, how many
total particles do we

122
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,130
have bouncing around?

123
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,630
20 moles of oxygen, 30 moles
of hydrogen, 50 moles of

124
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,490
nitrogen gas.

125
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,570
Add them up.

126
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,710
We have 100 moles of gas.

127
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,940
So if we want to figure out the
total pressure first, we

128
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,990
can just apply this 100 moles.

129
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,690
Let me erase this.

130
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,930
I want to keep the
problem statement

131
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,170
there the whole time.

132
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,480
There you go.

133
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,940
And I can erase some stuff
that you're not

134
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,470
seeing off the screen.

135
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,180
And now I'm ready.

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,410
So we have 100 moles.

137
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,920
So we just do our PV
is equal to nRT.

138
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
We're trying to solve for P.

139
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,180
P times 4 meters cubed
is equal to n. n is

140
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,140
the number of moles.

141
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,000
We have 100 moles.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,810
Is equal to 100 moles times R.

143
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,250
I'll put a blank there for R,
because we have to figure out

144
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,010
which R we want to use.

145
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,940
Times temperature, remember we
have to do it in Kelvin.

146
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,960
So 0 degrees Celsius
is 273 Kelvin.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,840
And then which R do we use?

148
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,710
I always like to write
my R's down here.

149
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,210
So we're dealing with meters
cubed, we're not dealing with

150
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,290
liters, so let's use this one.

151
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,190
8.3145 meters cubed pascals
per mole Kelvin.

152
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:15,950
   

153
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,010
The units there, I think I
should keep, these are in

154
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:25,990
meters cubed pascals divided
by moles Kelvin.

155
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,780
And then our temperature
was 273 Kelvin.

156
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,179
Now let's do a little
dimensional analysis to make

157
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,530
sure that we're doing
things right.

158
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,740
These meters cancel out
with those meters.

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,280
We divide both sides of the
equation by meters.

160
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
These moles cancel
with these moles.

161
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,549
The moles of the numerator, the
moles of the denominator.

162
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,330
Kelvin in the numerator, Kelvin
in the denominator.

163
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,140
And all we're left
with is pascals.

164
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,165
Which is good because that
is a unit of pressure.

165
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:52,380
   

166
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,320
So if we divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

167
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,350
   

168
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,470
I'll just divide the 100 by 4.

169
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,310
25 times 8.3145 times 273.

170
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,950
And the only unit that we were
left with was pascals.

171
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,570
Which is nice, because that's
a unit of pressure.

172
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:21,670
So, let's do the math, 25 times
8.3145 times 273 is

173
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:31,640
equal to 56,746 pascals.

174
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,500
And that might seem like
a crazy number.

175
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,240
But the pascal is actually a
very small amount of pressure.

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:48,220
It actually turns out that
101,325 pascals is equal to

177
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,340
one atmosphere.

178
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,380
So if we want to figure out how
many atmospheres this is,

179
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,630
we could just divide that.

180
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,970
   

181
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,370
Let me look it up
on this table.

182
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,390
Yes, 101,325.

183
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,690
So if we wanted to, we could
write this in kilopascals.

184
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,160
That's 56.746 kilopascals.

185
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,940
Or if we wanted it in
atmospheres we just take

186
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,670
56,746 divided by 101,325.

187
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,210
It equals 0.56 atmospheres.

188
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,570
So that's the total pressure
being exerted

189
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,160
from all of the gases.

190
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,720
I deleted that picture.

191
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,280
So this is the total pressure.

192
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,270
So our question is, what's
the partial pressure?

193
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,960
We could use either of these
numbers, they're just in

194
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
different units.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,170
What's the partial pressure of
just the oxygen by itself?

196
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,490
Well, you look at the moles,
because we don't care about

197
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,450
the actual mass.

198
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,140
Because we're assuming that
they're ideal gases.

199
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,980
We want to look at the
number of particles.

200
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,050
Because remember, we said
pressure times volume is

201
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,300
proportional to the number of
particles times temperature.

202
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,660
And they're all at the
same temperature.

203
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,760
So the number of particles
is what matters.

204
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,610
So oxygen represents 20%
of the particles.

205
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,280
20/100.

206
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,710
So, the partial pressure of
oxygen, let me write that as

207
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,370
pressure due to oxygen,
due to O2.

208
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,020
It's going to be 20% of
the total pressure.

209
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:23,070
20% times, let me write
56.746 kilopascals.

210
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,360
I just took this pressure
measurement.

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,930
If I wanted atmospheres,
times 0.56 atmospheres.

212
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,720
So the partial pressure of
oxygen-- well, I already have

213
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
the 0.56 written there.

214
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:45,880
So times 0.2 is equal to
0.112 atmospheres.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
It's just 20% of this.

216
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,780
How did I get 20%?

217
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,420
We have a total of 100 mole
molecules in our balloon.

218
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,320
20 moles of them are oxygen.

219
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,710
So 20% are oxygen.

220
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,800
So 20% of the pressure is going
to be due to oxygen.

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,640
So it's this many atmospheres.

222
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,360
If I took 20% times
the 56,000.

223
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:16,620
0.2 times 56, you get roughly
11.2 kilopascals.

224
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,670
I'm just multiplying 20% by
any of these numbers.

225
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,920
And the numbers are going to
change depending on the units.

226
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,930
So you do the same process.

227
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,650
What is the partial pressure
due to nitrogen?

228
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:32,430
Well even though 2/3 of the mass
is nitrogen, only 50% of

229
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,360
the actual particles
are nitrogen.

230
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,470
So 50% of the pressures is due
to the nitrogen particles.

231
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,880
Remember, you have to convert
everything to moles.

232
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,530
Because we only care about
the number of particles.

233
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,050
So if you want to know the
partial pressure due to the

234
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:50,390
nitrogen molecules,
it's 50% of these.

235
00:12:50,390 --> 00:13:03,400
So it's 28,373 pascals.

236
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,010
That's roughly.

237
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,920
Or if you took half of this,
approximately 28.4

238
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,520
kilopascals.

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,590
Or approximately 0.28
atmospheres.

240
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,530
And then finally, if you want
to figure out the partial

241
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:24,600
pressure due to the hydrogen
atoms. The partial pressure

242
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,560
due to the hydrogen atoms.
Hydrogen, even though it's a

243
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,130
very small part of the mass,
it actually represents 30%

244
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,300
percent of the molecules.

245
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,280
And it's the molecules that
are bumping into things.

246
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
We don't care so much
about the mass.

247
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:40,210
So 30% of the molecules.

248
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,830
And remember, when we talk
about kinetic energy, if

249
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,900
something with a small mass has
the same kinetic energy,

250
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,200
it's actually moving faster.

251
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,840
So when we talk about
temperature, that's average

252
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,800
kinetic energy.

253
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,070
So maybe in this we could
imagine that the hydrogen

254
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,750
might be moving faster than the
nitrogen or the oxygen.

255
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,020
But we don't have to think about
that too much right now.

256
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,160
But the partial pressure due to
hydrogen is just 30% of any

257
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,810
of these numbers.

258
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,320
Pick one.

259
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,570
Let's do it in atmospheres.

260
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,900
   

261
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:13,520
0.3 times 0.56 is equal
to 0.168 atmospheres.

262
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,170
And so the total pressure
should be equal to the

263
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,690
pressure of each of the
partial pressures

264
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,730
of each of the gases.

265
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,100
Plus the partial pressure of
oxygen, plus the partial

266
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,640
pressure of hydrogen.

267
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,140
And so this one, we figured
out was 0.28 atmospheres.

268
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,730
The oxygen was 0.112
atmospheres.

269
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,250
And this was 0.168.

270
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,610
And if you add these together,
you will see indeed, that they

271
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,900
add to 0.56 atmospheres.

272
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,770
Which was the total pressure
of our system.

273
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,340
Anyway, this is a very long
and hairy problem.

274
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,130
But the key takeaway is that
every molecule in the system

275
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,030
contributes to the total
pressure in proportion to the

276
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,760
number of moles it has as a
percentage of the total number

277
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,280
of moles in the system.

278
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,800
I hope that didn't confuse
you too much.

279
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,181
