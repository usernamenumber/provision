1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,390
We are on problem 18. They give us an equation.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:20,070
h of t is equal to c minus d minus 4t, all of that squared.

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,310
At time equals 0,

4
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,520
a ball was thrown up from an initial height of 6 feet.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,260
Until the ball hit the ground,

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,700
its height in feet after t seconds was given

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,040
by the function h above.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,710
And c and d are positive constants.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,450
So they're telling us at time 0

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,600
we're already at height 6, right?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,360
So h of 0, time 0, the height is already 6.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,990
If the ball

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,770
reaches its maximum height of 106 feet at time 2.5,

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,830
so h of 2.5 is equal to 106,

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,370
what is the height in feet of the ball at time t equals 1?

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,090
So we want to figure out h of 1.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,460
That's what they want to know.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,350
So in order to figure out h of 1,

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,790
we essentially have to figure out what c

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,770
and d are going to be, right?

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,080
So how can we do that?

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,270
Well, we know what h of 0 is, so let's substitute.

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,710
So h of 0 gives us this. Let's put t equals 0 here.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:29,220
You get c minus d minus 4 times 0 squared.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,210
And that is equal to 6.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,470
And then if we simplify this,this is, of course, 0, right?

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,780
So you get c minus d squared is equal to 6.

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,030
Now the second equation, h of 2.5 is equal to 106.

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,930
So that means that c minus d minus-- what's 4 times 2.5?

30
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,880
4 times 2.5 is 10, right? I put 2.5 in for t.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,000
I just did that to save some space.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,500
d minus 10 squared is equal to 106.

33
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,660
And now if we want to multiply this out

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,130
just to see where this takes us,

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,590
because actually I don't know where it will,

36
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:19,650
you get c minus-- I'll put it in brackets

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,920
because it's going to be a long expression--

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,540
multiplying this out, you get d squared minus 20d plus 100.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,770
All that equals 106.

40
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,050
And then distribute the negative signs, you get c

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,870
squared-- sorry, this isn't a square,

42
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,890
I don't know where I got the squared from.

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,090
See what happens when you take the SAT?

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,900
c minus d squared plus 20d minus 100--

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,300
I just distributed the negative sign--is equal to 106.

46
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,540
And then, let's see, we could add 100 to both sides.

47
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,900
You get c minus d squared plus 20d is equal to 206.

48
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,020
I just added 100 to both sides.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,460
So we're left with two equations.

50
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,130
We're left with this: c minus d squared is equal to 6.

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,070
And then we're left with this:

52
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,220
c minus d squared plus 20d is equal to 206.

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,430
And something should be jumping out at you.

54
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,010
There's a c minus d squared in both terms.

55
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,400
c minus d squared is 4.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,610
Oh no, sorry, c minus d squared is 6,

57
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,350
the previous equation tells us.

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,220
So we can substitute 6 right here.

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,770
So if you put 6 there, you got 6 plus 20d is equal to 206.

60
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,630
Subtract 6 from both sides.

61
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,570
20d is equal to 200. d is equal to 10.

62
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,800
Now if we substitute d equals 10

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,740
back in to c minus d squared, what do we have?

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,710
d is equal to 10, right?

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:54,650
So c minus 100 is equal to 6, or c is equal to 106.

66
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,040
And if you have an intuition for how parabolas look,

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,330
you probably could've not guessed,

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,380
you probably would have known that.

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,170
You would have known that

70
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,020
c is actually going to be the peak point of this parabola.

71
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,650
And they tell us that the peak point is at point 106.

72
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,280
And then you could've solved for d from there.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,910
But if you didn't have that intuition,

74
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,430
you could've just chugged through the algebra

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,040
like we just did.

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,680
So we know c, we know d,

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,370
so we know the function is now h of t is equal to 106,

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:31,680
minus 10, minus 4t, all of that squared.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,380
And so we want to know what happens when t equals 1,

80
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:46,040
so h of 1 is equal to 106, minus 10 minus 4 squared.

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:54,150
So that equals 106 minus 6 squared equals 106 minus 36,

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,580
which is equal to 70. And we are done.

83
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,360
h of 1 is equal to 70, which took us a little time,

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,570
but it was worth it.

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,090
I'll see you in the next
