1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,110
We've done a bunch of examples
looking at the actual

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,070
molecular structure and trying
to come up with the name.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,960
In this video, we'll go
the other way around.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,020
We'll start with the name and
see if we can actually draw

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,810
the molecular structure of
whatever this might be.

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:15,530
So let's start.

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,400
When you first look at these,
it's very daunting, but you

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,970
always want to start really at
the end, so you know what kind

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,930
of the core of the structure
is going to be.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,790
So if you look at the end of
this, you have an -ane, so

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,915
there's not going to be any
double or triple bonds here.

12
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,350
It's all single bonds.

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,790
It's a hexadecane, so let's
think about that.

14
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,170
Hexadec-, that's six and ten.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,520
Hexadec- was a prefix for
16, so this is 16

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,640
single-bonded carbons.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:01,150
And cyclohexadecane, so 16
single-bonded carbons in a

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,680
ring, so this part
of it right here.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,440
So let me just do this.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,730
So cyclohexadecane, let's draw
that part first. It's not easy

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:15,480
to draw even a 16-carbon ring,
so let's start here.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:31,790
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:39,130
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen,

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,550
fifteen, and then sixteen.

25
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,230
I think I got it.

26
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,400
Let me count them again and
then I can connect them up

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,970
into cycles.

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,120
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,900
ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,690
All right, I drew the
cyclohexadecane part.

31
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,710
Now, if we go back a little,
let's see, we have a

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,960
2,9-diisopropyl.

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,930
What does this mean?

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,970
This means that we have an
isopropyl at the two

35
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,940
and the nine spot.

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,690
Now when you are drawing the
structure from the name, you

37
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,780
could just arbitrarily on
someplace on this ring pick

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,420
what your one through your
sixteen spots are.

39
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,830
I'll just arbitrarily pick them,
because I could have

40
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,540
drawn this ring any which way.

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,420
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,550
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

43
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,770
All right, so this next
piece right here, let

44
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,390
me do this in magenta.

45
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,820
2,9-diisopropyl, this is telling
us that at spot number

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,660
two and at spot number nine,
I have isopropyl.

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,650
The di- is just saying I have
two isopropyls at two and

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,750
nine, so you can kind
of ignore the di-.

49
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,240
I have an isopropyl, and you may
or may not remember that

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
an isopropyl looks like this.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,020
It's three carbons, so it's
going to be one, two, three,

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,640
and the connection point to the
main ring in this case is

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
going to be in the middle
carbon, so it

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,180
kind of forms a Y.

55
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,820
All of the isos, the isopropyl,
isobutyl, they all

56
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,840
look like Y's, so it's going to
be linked right over here.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,550
That's also going to happen at
the ninth carbon, so at the

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,550
ninth carbon we're going to
have another isopropyl.

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,750
We're going to have another
isopropyl at the ninth carbon.

60
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,970
All right, we've taken care
of the 2,9-isopropyl.

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,840
Then we have the 6-ethyl, which
is just a two carbon.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,740
Remember, meth- is one, eth-
is two, prop- is three.

63
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,780
Let me write this down.

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,600
So this is going to be prop-
is equal to three.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Isoprop- is equal to that type
of shape right over there.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,760
In this case, eth- is equal to
two, so it's a 6-ethyl group.

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,380
So at six we have an ethyl
group, so one, two, carbons,

68
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,930
and it's connected at the six
carbon on the main ring.

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,190
And then finally we have
a cyclopentyl.

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,950
So if we look at-- let me find
a color I haven't used yet--

71
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,700
cyclopentyl.

72
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,080
so pent- is five, but it's five
in a cycle, so this is a

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,160
five-carbon ring that's
branching

74
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,090
off of the main ring.

75
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,800
It's at the first spot.

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,940
Let me draw a five-carbon rings,
so pent- is equal to

77
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,410
five, so it would look
like this, one: two,

78
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,285
three, four, five.

79
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,140
It looks just like a pentagon.

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,640
That's a cyclopentyl group and
it's attached to the one

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,190
carbon on my cyclohexadecane,
so it is

82
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,370
attached just like that.

83
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,840
We're done.

84
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,680
We've drawn 1-cyclopentyl-6-
ethyl-2,9-diisop

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,930
ropylcyclohexadecane.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,590
Let's do another one.

87
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,360
I think we're getting
the hang of it.

88
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,380
So here, maybe we can do this
one a little bit faster.

89
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,180
Let's see, we have a
tetramethyldodecane, so the

90
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,320
main root here is the
dodecane, do- for

91
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,650
two, dec- for ten.

92
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,210
This is a 12-carbon chain.

93
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,310
It's not in a cycle, so let
me just draw it out.

94
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,180
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

95
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,930
ten, eleven, twelve, and so
we can just number them

96
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,510
arbitrarily, just because
I could have drawn

97
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,160
this any which way.

98
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:50,200
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,860
ten, eleven, twelve.

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,600
That's the dodecane,
all single bonds.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
Then we have a
3,6,9,9-tetramethyl.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,565
All this is telling us--
remember, meth- is one carbon,

103
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,520
so all this is telling us is
at the three, the six, the

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,150
nine, so at the three, the six
and twice at the nine spot, we

105
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,520
have methyl groups, and we
have four methyl groups.

106
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,070
That's all the tetramethyl
is saying so it's

107
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,800
a little bit redundant.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,820
We know we have four of
them here: 3,6,9,9.

109
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,270
We have methyl groups at
each of those places.

110
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,990
We have one methyl group at
three, and then that is bonded

111
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,590
with the third carbon on
the dodecane chain.

112
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,570
We have one at six bonded
to the six carbon on

113
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,540
the dodecane chain.

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,320
We have two at nine, so that's
one at nine and then we have

115
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,130
another one at nine bonded
to the nine carbon on the

116
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,100
dodecane chain.

117
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,890
And we're done.

118
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,590
That's it.

119
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,840
That's 3,6,9,9-
tetramethyldodecane.

120
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,480
Let's do another one.

121
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,730
1,3-bis(1,1-dime
thylethyl)cyclopentane.

122
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,080
So once again, just kind
of breathe slowly.

123
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,230
It's very daunting right when
you look at it, but just start

124
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,670
with the core: cyclopentane.

125
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,185
That's just a simple
five-carbon ring.

126
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:12,290
A five carbon ring that looks
like a pentagon: one, two,

127
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,270
three, four, five.

128
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,060
There you go.

129
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,650
That is a five-carbon ring.

130
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,220
We can number it however we
want, so one, two, three,

131
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,290
four, and five.

132
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,260
This is telling us at the one
and the three position we

133
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,360
have-- and the bis- is
kind of redundant.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,810
This is saying we have
two of these things.

135
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,560
Obviously, we have two.

136
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,990
We have one at the one
and one at the three.

137
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,250
So you can kind of
ignore the bis-.

138
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,600
That's just the convention
and we've seen

139
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,740
that multiple times.

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,440
But at each of those positions,
we have a

141
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,690
1,1-dimethylethyl.

142
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,800
So what's a dimethylethyl
look like?

143
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,830
So let's think about
it a little bit.

144
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,280
Let's think about it and
let me do it orange.

145
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,860
They obviously named it using
systematic naming and what we

146
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,960
have here, we have an ethyl
as kind of the core

147
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,650
of this side chain.

148
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,620
So if an ethyl is equal to two
carbons, so this is two

149
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,970
carbons right there.

150
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,320
So let me draw a two
carbon: one, two.

151
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,140
That is two carbons
right over there.

152
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,820
I'm just drawing it
at the three spot.

153
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,700
I'll draw it also at the
one spot, actually.

154
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,630
So that is two carbons
right there.

155
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,970
That's the ethyl part.

156
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,380
And then on 1,1, so if we number
them, we number where

157
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,330
it's connected, so
it's one, two.

158
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,179
This is saying 1,1-dimethyl.

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,570
So on this ethyl chain,
you have two methyls.

160
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,690
Remember, methyl is equal to
one, so this is one carbon.

161
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,809
You have one carbon.

162
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,600
That's what methyl is, but
you have two of them.

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,950
You have dimethyl.

164
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,760
You have it twice
at the one spot.

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,550
So you have one methyl here
and then you have another

166
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,140
methyl there.

167
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,910
Same thing over here.

168
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,090
You have 1-methyl on the one
spot and then you have another

169
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,750
1-methyl on the one spot.

170
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,110
And then you are connected at
positions one and positions

171
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,940
three, so you're connected there
and you are connected

172
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,290
right over there.

173
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,930
And you're done, That's it.

174
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,560
That is our structure.

175
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,970
Now, if you did this with common
naming, instead of this

176
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,880
group being a 1,1-dimethylethyl,
you might

177
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,120
see that we're connected to
a group that has one, two,

178
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,170
three, four carbons in it.

179
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,520
The carbon that we're connected
to branches off to

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,415
three other carbons.

181
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:25,960
It is a tert-butyl.

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,450
So you can also call
this a 1,3-- let me

183
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,390
just write it down.

184
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:39,100
So another name for this would
be 1,3-tert-- or sometimes

185
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:48,070
people just write a t there--
t-butylcyclo-- no, actually I

186
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,890
should say di-t-butyl, because
we have two of them.

187
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,140
1,3-di-t-butylcyclopentane.
