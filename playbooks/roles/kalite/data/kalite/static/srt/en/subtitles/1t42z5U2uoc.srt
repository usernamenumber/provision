1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:04,203
Lets think a little bit about how margin works for futures contract.

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:10,733
So lets say that the terms of the contract are a 1,000 pounds of apples for delivery on November 15th.

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:14,067
And we're assuming that this is some date in the future.

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,667
And right now on the futures exchange the market delivery price,

5
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:24,733
so the price in which the apples will change hand in the future is 200 dollars.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:29,400
And I've written here what the exchange specifies for the initial and maintenance margin

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
and we'll talk about that more in a second

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,333
but this essencially means that both the buyer and the seller for, the initial margin,

9
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,600
have to put up 20 dollars, sometimes it will be specified as an absolute dollar amount, like

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,533
I've just done, sometimes it might just be a percentage of the actual

11
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:50,267
delivery price. So they both have to put up $20, and this guy has agreed to buy a thousand pounds of apples

12
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,267
from this guy on

13
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:55,400
november 15th for 200 dollars.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,333
So its essencially 20 cents a pound.

15
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,867
Now lets say that a day goes by and the next day - these guys have this contract - this price right here

16
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,400
is fixed in their minds.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,667
But lets say the next day the same contract between 2 other parties, between

18
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:13,067
2 other parties, the same contract, trades with the delivery price of

19
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:17,000
$190. Now all of a sudden this

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,133
guy over here feels silly! He's like: "man im agreeing to buy something for $200 dollars in the future,

21
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:27,400
which some other dude, all of a sudden, has agreen to buy for $190 dollars".

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,133
This guy over here feels really smart, he agreed

23
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:34,533
to sell something for $200 the day before, and now people are selling it

24
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:38,067
for a $190, so hes kind of $10 better than the people

25
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:40,733
participating in the futures market today.

26
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:45,067
The way mark to market works with futures contracts

27
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,667
is that the exchange says "well, you know what? I'm afraid that this guy,

28
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:51,400
if things keep moving against him, he's not even going to want

29
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,667
to put up the money to buy at $200 dollars

30
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,667
if he can buy at the market for $190 dollars

31
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:03,267
or something lower, so I'm going to reset their futures contract

32
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:06,467
to a delivery price of $190".

33
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:11,200
But, to make things fair, this guy is gonna be $10 in the hole.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,133
He's getting a $10 deal, if I take the delivery price from $200 to $190 dollars

35
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,667
I need to take $10 from this guy, because he's getting a $10 dollars better deal.

36
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:26,267
So from his margin account I take it from 20 dollars to $10 dollars

37
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:29,000
and then I place the $10 in this guy's margin account.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If he's going to get a $10 less of a good price on the delivery date

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,133
then let me give him the $10 dollars right now, so his margin account will go

40
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,333
to $30 dollars, now if this number was

41
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,399
$18, $17, $16 or $15

42
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,210
this guy wouldn't have to do anything.

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,393
But right here he has triggered his maintenance

44
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,808
margin, and actually, he's right at our maintenance margin.

45
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:51,526
So lets say that he goes, that the next

46
00:02:51,526 --> 00:02:53,894
day this happens a little bit more, he goes down to

47
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,866
$185 and we have to do the process again:

48
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:00,303
This guy losses $5, he goes down to $5.

49
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,718
This guy will be given $5,

50
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,065
so he goes to $35 dollars

51
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:11,449
in order for him to essentially reset the futures price, he's been given another $5.

52
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,442
Now this guy has only $5 in his margin account

53
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,067
and the maintenance margin is $10,

54
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,067
so it triggers a margin call, and this guy is got to

55
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:25,333
find some place to put another $15 dollars in his margin call.

56
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,400
Every time you get below the maintenance margin, it triggers

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,933
a margin call and you have to refill your margin account to the initial margin. So he has to add

58
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,267
$15

59
00:03:35,267 --> 99:59:59,999
so he gets back to $20.
