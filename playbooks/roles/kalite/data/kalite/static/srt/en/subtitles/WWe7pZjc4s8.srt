00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:06,764
In the last video, we hopefully set up some of the intuition for why - or I should say what - the Maclaurin

2
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:11,733
series is all about, and I said at the end of the videos that a Maclaurin series is just a special case

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,800
of a Taylor series. In the case of a Maclaurin series, we're approximating

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,800
this function around x is equal to 0, and a Taylor series, and we'll talk about that in a future video,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,800
you can pick an arbitrary x value - or f(x) value, we should say, around which to approximate the function.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,133
But with that said, let's just focus on Maclaurin, becuase to some degree it's a little bit simpler,

7
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:39,800
and that by itself can lead us to some pretty profound conclusions about mathematics,

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,733
and that's actually where I'm trying to get to.

9
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,133
So let's take the Maclurin series of some interesting functions

10
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:48,359
and I'm gonna do functions where it's pretty easy to take the derivatives, and you can

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,067
/keep/ taking their derivatives over and over and over and over and over again.

12
00:00:53,067 --> 00:01:01,733
So let's take the Maclaurin series of cosine of x, so if f(x)=cos(x),

13
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:06,867
then - before I even apply this formula, that we somewhat derived in the last video,

14
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,800
or at least got the intuitive for in the last video -

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,067
let's take a bunch of derivatives of f(x), just so we have a good sense of it.

16
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:20,467
So, if we take the first derivative, if we take the first derivative, derivative of cos(x) = -sin(x)

17
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:25,800
if we take the derivative of that, if we take the derivative of that,

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,467
derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and we have the negative there, so it's -cos(x)

19
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:35,867
so if we take the derivative of that, so this is the third derivative of cos(x),

20
00:01:35,867 --> 00:01:41,067
now it's just going to be positive sine of x, and if we take the derivative of that,

21
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,733
we get cos(x) again.

22
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:47,800
We get cosine of x again. So if we take the derivative of that,

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
this is the fourth derivative, I should, I should use this notation

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,867
but you get the idea, we'll get cos(x) again.

25
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:57,733
And if you look at what we talked about in the last video, we want the difference - we want

26
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:01,200
the function, and we want it's various derivatives evaluated at 0,

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:10,800
so let's evaluate it at 0. So f(0), cos(0) is 1, cosine of zero is one.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,133
Whether you're talking about zero radians or zero degrees, doesn't matter,

29
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:28,467
sine of zero is zero, so this is f prime of - f prime of zero, is zero. And then cos(0)

30
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,867
is, once again, one, but we have the negative out there, so it becomes negative one.

31
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:37,467
So f - the second derivative evaluated at zero is negative one.

32
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:42,800
Let's take the third derivative, the third derivative evaluated at zero

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,000
well, sine of zero is just zero, and then the fourth derivative evaluated at zero,

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,467
cosine of zero is one. So f prime prime prime at zero is now equal to one.

35
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,800
So you see an interesting pattern here - one, zero, negative one, zero, one,

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,133
then you go to zero, then you go to negative one, zero.

37
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:05,600
So if we were to apply this to find it's Maclaurin representation, what would we get?

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,133
Let me do my best attempt at this. So we would get, our polynomial would be -

39
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:19,533
so our polynomial approximation of cosine of x is going to be f(0),

40
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:28,600
f(0) is one, and then we have one plus f'(0) times x.

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,600
But f'(0) is just zero, so we're not going to have this term over there, it's going to be

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,800
zero times x, I won't even take the trouble of writing it down, it would be this zero

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,133
time x, then plus f prime prime or second derivative, which is negative one,

44
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:49,467
so I'll write negative - negative, this is a negative one right here,

45
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:53,133
this is a negative one, times x squared, times x squared,

46
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:59,600
over 2 factorial - over two factorial, which in this case is just going to be two.

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,333
But I'll just write it down here as two factorial, to make the pattern a little bit more obvious,

48
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:09,333
and then we go to the next term, the third derivative evaluated at zero

49
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:14,200
but the third derivative evaluated at zero is just zero, so this term won't be there as well,

50
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,431
then you go to the fourth derivative, the fourth derivative evaluated at zero is positive one,

51
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:23,733
so this coefficient right here is going to be a one, and so you're going to have

52
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:30,533
one times x to the fourth over four factorial, so plus x to the fourth over four factorial,

53
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,000
and I think you start seeing a pattern now.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
You have sign switches - and you would see this if we kept going, so

55
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,133
you can verify it for yourself if you don't believe me -

56
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:44,200
so you have a positive sign, a negative sign, a positive sign, and then a

57
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,067
negative sign, so on and so forth, and this is, uh, one times x to the zeroth power,

58
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:54,800
then you jump two to x to the squared, jump two to x to the fourth, and

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,267
so if we kept that up, we'd have a positive sign, now we have a negative sign,

60
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:03,267
it would be x to the sixth over six factorial, then you have a positive sign,

61
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:07,800
x to the eighth over eight factorial, and then you'd have a negative sign,

62
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,867
x to the tenth over ten factorial, and you can just keep going that way.

63
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:18,867
And if you kept going with this series, this would be the polynomial representation of

64
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:23,533
cosine of x. And it's frankly just kind of cool that if can be represented this way.

65
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,600
It's a pretty simple pattern here for a trigonometric function.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
Once again, it kind of tells you that all of this math is connected. And we'll see,

67
00:05:30,800 --> 99:59:59,999
two or three videos from now, it's connected in far more profound ways then you can possibly imagine.
