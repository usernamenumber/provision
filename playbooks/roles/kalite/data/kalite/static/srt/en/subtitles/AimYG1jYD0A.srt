1
00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:03,686
In the last video we started to explore the payments

2
00:00:03,686 --> 00:00:05,979
that could flow into a country or out of a country

3
00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:07,867
and now I want to continue it more

4
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:09,364
In particular, we focused on

5
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:10,938
the current account last time, and that

6
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:12,539
focused on things like trade

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,721
exports and imports

8
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,997
income earned from assets in another country

9
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:18,834
or income that someone from outside of the country

10
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,050
earns from assets

11
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,804
in the country that we're studying

12
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,919
or just transfers that are happening

13
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,924
Now, when we look at the capital account

14
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,332
in this video right over here

15
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:28,006
(I wrote capital accounts,

16
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:29,072
but there shouldn't be an "s" over here)

17
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:32,097
we'll look at other ways or other reasons

18
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:36,160
why we might have inflows or outflows of payments

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,977
In particular, the capital account is focused on

20
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:44,722
the change in assets

21
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,395
that either foreigners own of

22
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:48,039
in this case the US

23
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,729
or that US nationals own of assets

24
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,450
that are someplace else

25
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,872
An this little triangle right over here

26
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,609
is the greek letter delta

27
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,095
just shorthand for change in

28
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:05,708
So, once again, let's focus first on the inflows

29
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,640
and when you're talking about change in assets

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,956
these would essentially be

31
00:01:08,956 --> 00:01:14,558
someone outside the US buying assets inside the US

32
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:17,673
from someone that was not foreign

33
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:20,754
So for example, if I am a homebuilder

34
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:22,108
I am an american citizen

35
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:24,843
and I build a home in the US

36
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:30,411
and I sell it for a million dollars to a Mexican national

37
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,078
maybe for their vacation home

38
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,011
that means that for just that transaction

39
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,140
there's been an increase

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,809
in foreign ownership of US assets

41
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,258
that a million dollar home

42
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:46,818
This number would be increased by a million dollars

43
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:48,944
And, so that is why it is an inflow

44
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:49,749
because when they bought that house

45
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:52,863
they would have to make a payment TO ME

46
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,314
And this right over here

47
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,812
and we have a little bunch of stuffs over here:

48
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,733
change in foreign-owned assets in US

49
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,979
it also includes financial derivatives here

50
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,428
and you don't have to worry too much about that

51
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:04,422
And it also has change in foreign reserves

52
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,318
The one way to think about the difference

53
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,700
between that and that right over there

54
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,803
you can view this as

55
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:12,808
private-owned changes in ownership

56
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:16,046
and this is essentially the offical changes in ownership

57
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,505
by either the government

58
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,175
or the central banks of foreign countries

59
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,405
And for a lot of countries

60
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:22,575
they are essentially one of the same thing

61
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,759
In the US, they kind of maintain this sort of independence

62
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,559
but this is, you can kind of view it as

63
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,556
the offical government ownership

64
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:33,336
and this over here is for the most part

65
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,682
private ownership

66
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,977
So once again if someone in the England

67
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,427
would come to the US

68
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:43,166
and buy, let's say, buy a share of IBM from an American

69
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,707
then that would increase the number right over here

70
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,071
But if the central bank of China decided to

71
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:53,647
buy an US government bond from some American

72
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:58,888
then this right over here would increase

73
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,255
But they both the general idea:

74
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:02,240
someone buys an asset

75
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,188
(we are not talking about the income on the asset,

76
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:05,739
we talked about the asset itself)

77
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,380
someone buys an asset from

78
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,129
or changes hands from an American national

79
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,188
to a foreign national

80
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,409
then these numbers would increase

81
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,219
and those foreign nationals

82
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:17,712
would have to make a payment into the US

83
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:20,748
So once again these are the inflows right over here

84
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:23,481
Now we take the other side of that coin

85
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:28,481
If I were to go out and buy vacation home in Italy

86
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,281
And let's say I buy it from an Italian.

87
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,955
Then I would have to make a payment to them

88
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,300
So that would be an outflow from the US

89
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,820
And I would get an asset in Italy

90
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,534
in exchange for my vacation home

91
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:43,014
So this number right over here would increase

92
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,014
Once again I wrote here in orange because it is an outflow:

93
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:49,014
I'm making a payment to a foreign national

94
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,842
And once again this is a breakdown between

95
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:54,214
this is really the private sector for the most part

96
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:59,284
and this over here is the US federal reserve

97
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:01,176
so if the US federal reserve would go

98
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:05,084
and buy an asset from a foreign government

99
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,351
bank or individual

100
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,684
let's say a foreign bond

101
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:12,218
Then this number right over here would increase

102
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,352
And actually the way I've classfied right over here:

103
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:15,551
government purchases

104
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:17,751
not the US federal reserve but the US government

105
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,190
actually still falls into this category

106
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,484
just the way I've set up the numbers

107
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,429
this right over here is the US federal reserve alone

108
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,384
now with that out of the way

109
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,708
Let's actually figure out whether we are running

110
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,319
a capital account deficit or a suplus

111
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,399
So let's get our caculator back

112
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,404
Let me open it right over here

113
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,905
so we can see our numbers

114
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,173
First of all let's think about the inflows

115
00:04:36,173 --> 00:04:39,592
this is how much more foreigners are buying US stuff

116
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:42,348
So they are buying 625

117
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,194
When I'm taling about stuff

118
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:43,923
I'm talking about assets

119
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,515
I'm not goods and services

120
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:49,399
I'm talking about stocks and bonds and real estate

121
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:55,587
So 625 billion plus another 165 billion

122
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,929
if we talk about the offical purchases of

123
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,657
governments and central banks

124
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,008
So this is how much the increase of assets

125
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,765
This is the changing assets purchase

126
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,147
from foreigners in the US

127
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:08,415
So they have to put in 790 billion dollars in 2007

128
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,010
to make those purchases

129
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,554
While on the other side of that

130
00:05:11,554 --> 00:05:14,487
The Americans went out and bought 380 billion

131
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:16,347
when I write (ANS), that's answer

132
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:17,274
that's just the previous answer

133
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,851
so we have 790 billion

134
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,916
which is what's inflowing

135
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,355
and now this is outflowing

136
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,844
380 billion to buy assets in other countries

137
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:27,128
that is what the non-federal actors do

138
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,488
and federal reserve also buys

139
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:32,621
and there is also outflows of payments

140
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,975
And we are left with 394 billion

141
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,605
A positive 394 billion

142
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:42,030
This is 394 billion larger than this right over here

143
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,633
So we are running a capital account surplus

144
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:47,088
let me write that

145
00:05:47,088 --> 00:06:02,222
So we end up with an capital account surplus

146
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:07,756
394 billion

147
00:06:07,756 --> 00:06:09,157
And so you see these numbers are

148
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,023
pretty close and I will tell you something

149
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:13,173
and hopefully in future videos you will understand

150
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,479
why this is happening in a little bit more depth

151
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,970
But these numbers actually should have been

152
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,528
the exactly same thing

153
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:25,489
but we see they are off by about 80 billion

154
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,915
So let me write this down

155
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:29,705
we have an 80 billion dollar discrepancy

156
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,689
And for most people that's a fairly large discrepancy

157
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,890
but for talking about an economy the size of

158
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,619
the United States

159
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,124
that is already near 15 trillion

160
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:40,937
it's not that huge a discrepancy

161
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:43,202
and you have to think of how all these stuffs are measured

162
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,246
They have to do serveys, they sample things

163
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,327
you know

164
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,263
they get all these numbers from all different sources

165
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:49,769
So that's actually reasonable that

166
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:52,470
you have some form of statistically discrepancy

167
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,450
That's what actually is right over here

168
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,001
This is the statistically discrepancy

169
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,736
In theory these numbers should be the exact amount

170
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,275
If you are running a current account deficit

171
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,442
then you should have the exact amount

172
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,114
in the capital account surplus

173
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:10,500
And vice versa, if you have a capital account deficit

174
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,129
then you would have to be running

175
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:13,948
a current account surplus

176
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:16,159
We will talk more about why this makes sense

177
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,823
I encourage you to think about it right now

178
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,121
why that makes sense

179
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,051
And the difference between these numbers

180
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,695
This is just the statistical discrepancy

181
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,441
by the bureau of economic analysis
