1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,108
Where we left off on the last video,

2
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:04,271
I think we're getting a reasonably good appreciation

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:09,219
for how huge the Sun is especially relative to the Earth

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:12,929
and how far the Earth is away from the Sun.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,289
And most of these diagrams that we see in science textbooks,

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:17,869
they don't give justice...

7
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,642
In fact, when I showed this Sun over here

8
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:22,747
that was about 5 or 6 inches across,

9
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:25,347
I said that the Earth would be this little speck,

10
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:30,634
about 40 feet to the left or the right,

11
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:34,490
or its orbit would have a radius of about 40 feet.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,383
So you wouldn't even notice it,

13
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,487
if you were looking at this thing over here.

14
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:41,809
It would be this little speck orbiting at this huge, huge distance.

15
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:45,019
If you look at this Sun over here

16
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:46,187
--if I were to draw the whole Sun--

17
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:49,646
it would have a diameter of about 20 inches.

18
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:52,978
So in this situation, this Earth right here

19
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:54,494
--this is drawn to scale--

20
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:57,175
this Earth would not be anywhere near this close,

21
00:00:57,175 --> 00:01:01,451
it would be about 200 feet that way,

22
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:05,689
or about 60 or 70 meters.

23
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:08,273
So if you could imagine, if the Sun was this size

24
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:10,458
sitting on something like a football field,

25
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:14,400
this little speck of an Earth, this little thing right here,

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,861
would be sitting on the other 40 yard line,

27
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,349
60 meters away.

28
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:21,849
So huge, you wouldn't even notice it.

29
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,606
You might notice this from a distance.

30
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,530
But you wouldn't even see this thing over here.

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,000
And the other planets are even further,

32
00:01:27,015 --> 00:01:28,058
well not all the other planets.

33
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,874
Obviously you have Mercury,

34
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,503
you have Mercury here.

35
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:34,104
I think most of us are familiar with these,

36
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,060
but I'll just list them in case.

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,270
That's Mercury. This is Venus.

38
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,726
Mercury is the smallest of the planets

39
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:42,092
that is not debated whether it is a planet.

40
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:44,323
Pluto is the smallest, but some people debate

41
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:48,033
whether it's really a planet or kind of a large solar body

42
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,333
or dwarf planet or one of those kind of things

43
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,422
And then you have Venus,

44
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,361
which is probably the closest in size to the Earth

45
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,611
or it is the closest in size to the Earth

46
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:01,057
and then you have Mars and then you have Jupiter.

47
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,235
And just to give you a sense of

48
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,185
once again how far these things are.

49
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:06,104
If I were to go back to the analogy of

50
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:08,302
this being the size of the Sun,

51
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:11,388
then Jupiter is five times further than Earth.

52
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:12,550
So this would be,

53
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,427
if I were to actually do this scale distance,

54
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:20,241
this would be 300 meters away.

55
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,550
So if I had a nice big medicine-ball-sized Sun,

56
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,049
or maybe a basketball-sized Sun--

57
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:27,324
a little bit bigger than a basketball

58
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:28,594
as it looks on my screen.

59
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:31,195
Then I would put this little thing

60
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,330
that's smaller than a ping-pong ball,

61
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,658
I would put this three football fields away.

62
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:38,607
That's how far Jupiter is.

63
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,008
And then Saturn's about twice as far as that.

64
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,327
Saturn is about nine times the distance.

65
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:45,261
Let me make that clear,

66
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:49,316
the Earth is one astronomical unit away from the Sun, roughly.

67
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:53,028
Its distance changes. It's not a perfectly circular orbit.

68
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:58,307
Jupiter is approximately a little bit 5+ astronomical units,

69
00:02:58,307 --> 00:02:59,433
so a little bit more than

70
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,035
5x the distance from the Sun to the Earth.

71
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:06,933
And Saturn is approximately 9 astronomical units

72
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:11,431
or 9x the distance from the Sun to the Earth.

73
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:13,810
So once again this would be 9 football fields away.

74
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,242
Or another way to think of it is

75
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,918
that it's essentially a kilometer away,

76
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,374
if we had kind of a medicine-ball-sized Sun.

77
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:24,266
This little, smaller-than-a-ping-pong-ball Saturn

78
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,474
would be a kilometer away.

79
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,800
And I just want to really reiterate that,

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,336
because you never kind of visuallize it that way.

81
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,204
Just for the sake of being able to draw it on a page,

82
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:36,301
you see diagrams that look like this

83
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,559
and they really don't give you a sense of

84
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:40,829
how small these planets are relative to the Sun

85
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,964
and especially relative to their distances from the Sun.

86
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:57,953
And after Saturn you have Uranus and then Neptune.

87
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,996
And obviously these guys are even further.

88
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,869
Just to give you a sense, you know, it's very easy

89
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:07,513
to start talking about galaxies and the universe.

90
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,815
But what I really just want to get, you konw,

91
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:14,663
already we're talking about huge distances, huge scale.

92
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:16,181
We already talk about that it would take a jet plane

93
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:20,043
17 years to travel from the Earth to the Sun.

94
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,447
Multiply that by five,

95
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,953
that's about 100 years to go from Jupiter to the Sun.

96
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:26,946
200 years to go from Saturn to the Sun.

97
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:31,329
So you could have had Abraham Lincoln get into a jet plane,

98
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,726
and he still wouldn't have got (if he left from Saturn),

99
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:36,288
he still would not have got to the Sun.

100
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:38,230
So these are huge, huge distances.

101
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,298
But we're not done, with the solar system there.

102
00:04:40,298 --> 00:04:42,195
Just to give a sense of scale.

103
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:46,468
So this is, this right here, that's the Sun

104
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:48,963
and each of these planets is narrower than these orbits.

105
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:50,175
So they just draw these orbits,

106
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,450
but you wouldn't actually even see

107
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,233
the actual planets here at this type of scale.

108
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,782
but this is one astronomical unit right over here,

109
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:59,460
the distance from the Sun to the Earth.

110
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,568
Then you have Mars. Then you have the asteroid belt.

111
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,639
There you have the asteroid belt,

112
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,798
which also has some pretty big things in itself.

113
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:09,684
It has these things

114
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,424
that are kind of considered almost dwarf planets.

115
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,263
Things like Ceres, you could look those kind of things up.

116
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,545
And then you have Jupiter out here,

117
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,666
and once again we said it would take about 100 years

118
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,804
or roughly 100 years

119
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:23,420
for a jet plane to get from Jupiter to the Sun.

120
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,623
But even if you take this whole box here,

121
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,312
which is a huge amount of distance,

122
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:30,570
roughly about five astronomical units,

123
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,619
It would take about 40 minutes

124
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:37,216
for light to get from the Sun to Jupiter,

125
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,996
So this is a huge, huge distance.

126
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,590
Even this huge distance,

127
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,787
we could put it into this little box right over here.

128
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:51,460
So this whole box, this whole box, right over there,

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,189
can be fit into this box,

130
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,272
and you need to do that

131
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,778
in order to appreciate the orbits of the outer planets.

132
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:00,030
And so on this scale,

133
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,654
the Earth and Venus and Mercury and Mars,

134
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,592
their orbits look pretty much,

135
00:06:05,592 --> 00:06:07,489
You can't even differentiate them from the Sun.

136
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:08,667
They look so close.

137
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,469
They almost look like that they're part of the Sun,

138
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:11,609
when you look at it on this scale.

139
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:12,664
And then you have Nepp..

140
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,256
you have the outer planets Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

141
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,331
and then you have a Kuiper belt.

142
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:21,790
This is more asteroids, but these are kind of more frozen...

143
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,467
You know when we think of ice,

144
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,448
we always think of water ice.

145
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:26,605
But if you are out here it's so cold,

146
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:28,158
that it's relatively getting dark now

147
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,535
because we're pretty far from the Sun,

148
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:31,775
that things that we normally associate as gases

149
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,059
are going to be in their solid form out here.

150
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,165
So this isn't just rocky elements.

151
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,270
This will also be things that you normally associate

152
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,522
as gases like methane, frozen methane.

153
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,612
But even here, we're not done.

154
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:46,685
We're not even out of the solar system yet.

155
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,762
And actually, just ot give you a sense of the scale,

156
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:50,843
we're operating on right here.

157
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,533
I have this chart right here from the voyager mission.

158
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,604
So the voyager missions, Voyager 1 and 2,

159
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:58,744
actually Voyager 2 left a little bit earlier, a month eariler,

160
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:00,739
Voyager 1 was just travelling faster.

161
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:05,238
They left about a year after I was born.

162
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,676
And their current velocity,

163
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,901
just to give you a sense of how fast Voyager 1,

164
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:19,061
Voyager 1 right here is right now travelling at 61,000 km/hr.

165
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:22,989
That's about 17 km/s.

166
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,941
That's the size of a city every second.

167
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:26,113
It's going that fast,

168
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,773
that's at least in my mind unfathomably fast velocity.

169
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:33,385
This thing has been travelling roughly that fast.

170
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,536
Well you know it has been going around planets

171
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,519
and gaining acceleration as it went around orbits.

172
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,392
But for most of the time it's been going at a pretty fast speed.

173
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:43,780
Just to translate it to people who don't relate to kilometers,

174
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,218
that's about 38,000 miles/hr.

175
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,771
So this huge, huge, unfathomably-fast speed,

176
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,215
and it's been doing it since 1977.

177
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:59,021
I was learning to walk, and when I was learning to walk

178
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,249
it was travelling at this super fast speed

179
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:05,600
and then when I was learning...

180
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,463
I mean our whole lives when we're sleeping, everything.

181
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:07,326
When we're eating, when I'm in elementary school,

182
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:13,028
it's still rocketing out of the solar system at roughly the speed.

183
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:14,318
Its velocity is changed.

184
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:15,609
But especially once it got outside of the planets

185
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:17,947
it has been roughly at this velocity.

186
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,218
So it has just been rocketing out

187
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:21,013
and I don't want to say only,

188
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,702
but it has gotten this far.

189
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:28,206
It has gotten about that far right there.

190
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:31,980
It's about a 115 or 116 astronomical units.

191
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,754
And to give a sense, there's 2 ways to think about this,

192
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,426
one says "Like wow! That's really far."

193
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,329
Because if you even know that even on this scale

194
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:40,742
you can't even see Earth's orbit,

195
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:43,272
so this looks like it's a pretty, pretty far distance.

196
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,571
And just to give you a sense of

197
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,745
how far 116 astronomical units are,

198
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:51,814
if 2000 years ago, Jesus got on a plane.

199
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:54,378
I actually cut and pasted a copy of Jesus

200
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:55,928
for visualization purposes.

201
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:59,892
But if He got on a jetliner at a 1,000 km/hr

202
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:01,809
when straight in that direction,

203
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,004
in the direction of the Voyager.

204
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:07,136
The Voyager would only just know be catching up to Jesus.

205
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:10,365
So this is a huge, huge, huge, huge distance

206
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,749
and at the same time even though it's a huge distance,

207
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,554
especially relative to the everything else we've talked about.

208
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:18,531
Relative to just even the outer regions of the solar system.

209
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:22,345
We are still talking in terms of a small scale.

210
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:26,481
So that is how far Voyager is and just to give a sense on this scale,

211
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:32,995
so this whole box over here can be contained in this box,

212
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:34,022
and when you look at this box,

213
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:38,990
Voyager is only gotten about that far.

214
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,580
After travelling at this unbelievable velocity for over 30 years,

215
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,794
for 33, for about 33 years,

216
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,720
just to give you an idea of these other things,

217
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,232
Sedna right here is one of the ...

218
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:53,965
it's a reasonably large sized outer-solar-system object.

219
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,533
It's one of the further-est objects

220
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,321
that we know of in the solar system.

221
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,135
And has this very eccentric orbit, so it gets,

222
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:02,403
I don't want to say relatively close,

223
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,189
but not unreasonably far away,

224
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:09,118
but then it gets really far away from the Sun.

225
00:10:09,118 --> 00:10:10,836
So even Sedna's orbit,

226
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,854
if I were to look at this whole box over here,

227
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:17,321
can be contained right over here.

228
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,538
So in this diagram right here, you couldn't even,

229
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,535
you wouldn't even be able to see,

230
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:21,686
it would be like a speck,

231
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:28,333
how far Voyager has travelled in 33 years, at 38,000 miles/hr.

232
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:33,367
You wouldn't even be able to notice, that distance.

233
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,996
And even though you can't even notice that distance,

234
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:37,683
we still have the Sun's influence.

235
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:42,574
The gravitational pull is still attracting things to it,

236
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:46,857
and this right here, we speculate is the Oort cloud,

237
00:10:46,857 --> 00:10:48,602
and this is where the comets originate from.

238
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,644
This is just a bunch of frozen, you can almost view it

239
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:54,611
as frozen gases and ice particles, things like that.

240
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,616
But this is kind of,

241
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:59,116
we're starting to get to outer regions of the solar system.

242
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:08,018
This distance right here is about 50,000 astronomical units.

243
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,219
And just to give you a scale,

244
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,589
because you hear a lot about light years and all of that.

245
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,328
Light years are about 63,000 astronomical units.

246
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:19,206
So if you go a light year out from the Sun,

247
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:22,656
then you will end up in the Oort cloud,

248
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,868
the hypothesized Oort cloud.

249
00:11:24,868 --> 00:11:27,267
And just to give a sense of the scale,

250
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:28,376
the Oort cloud is actually,

251
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:30,313
you know most of the planets orbits

252
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,095
are roughly in the same plane,

253
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:35,012
but this right here is the orbits of the planets,

254
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,947
and once again these lines are drawn too thick!

255
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,913
They are just drawn the thinnest possible so that you can see them.

256
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:40,489
But they are still drawn too thick.

257
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,966
And this goes all the way to the Kuiper belt all of these over here,

258
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:46,544
so all the way out to the Kuiper belt.

259
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,433
All the way out to all of the major planets.

260
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:53,192
This is Pluto's orbit right over here.

261
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:57,708
This whole diagram is only sitting in, right over there.

262
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,313
You can barely see it.

263
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:00,919
That's this whole diagram, is just that dot in this.

264
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,521
And then you can see the Oort cloud all around it.

265
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,619
It's more of a spherical cloud, and we think it exists.

266
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:08,837
Obviously it's hard to observe things at that distance.

267
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:09,844
So hopefully that gives you

268
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:12,958
a beginning sense of the scale of the solar system.

269
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,608
And what's really going to blow your mind is that,

270
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,458
if this hasn't blown your mind already is that

271
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,638
this whole thing is going to start looking like a speck.

272
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,593
When you even just start looking

273
00:12:22,593 --> 00:12:24,067
at the local area around our galaxy,

274
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,542
Much less than the universe as a whole.

275
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,099
Anyway I don't want to get ....

276
00:12:27,099 --> 99:59:59,999
Well anyway...This starts to get crazy.
