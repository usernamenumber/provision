1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,730
Here we are on problem number 8.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,820
The total daily profit, p in dollars, from producing and

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,000
selling x units of a certain product is given by the

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,360
function p of x.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:23,470
So the profit as a function of x is equal to 17x minus 10x

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,460
plus b where b is a constant.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,640
If 300 units were produced and sold yesterday for a profit of

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,060
$1,900, what is the value of b?

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,610
So we know that p of 300-- 300 units-- the profit when we did

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,050
300 units is $1,900. And we want to figure out b.

11
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,490
So what is p of 300? So let's put 300 in here.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,280
We know it also equals 1,900 but let's put it here.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:03,020
So it's 17 times 300 minus 10 times 300 plus b.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,000
I just put 300 in for x.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,790
So we're trying to find the profit for 300

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,940
and we know already that equals 1,900.

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:18,020
So what's 17 times 300? 17 times 3 is 51.

18
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,030
Let's add those two 0s.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,250
Minus-- and what's 10 times 300,that's 3,000--

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,090
3,000 plus b is equal to 1,900.

21
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:40,060
And then we get 5,100 minus 3,000 minus b is equal to 1,900.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,190
What's 5,100 minus 3,000? 2,100.

23
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,630
And 2,100 minus b is equal to 1,900.

24
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,140
Minus b is equal to, subtract 2,100 from both sides,

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,050
and you get minus 200. b is equal to 200.

26
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,580
And that is choice E.

27
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:05,070
Next problem. Problem number 9.

28
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,000
I will switch colors.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The number that results when an integer is multiplied by

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,950
itself cannot end in which of the following digits?

31
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,010
Interesting.

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,550
Well, what's a number when it's multiplied by itself?

33
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,000
That's like squaring a number.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,650
So let's kind of study what all the perfect squares look like

35
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,460
So when I square 1, I get 1. When I square 2 I get 4.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,070
When I square 3 I get 9. Square 4 I get 16.

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:38,810
5 is 25. 6 is 36. 7 is 49. 8 is 64.

38
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,010
So let's look at the numbers that it can be.

39
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,050
OK, we could go 9 is 81.

40
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,410
Looks like it can be a 1, a 4, a 9-- and we could keep going

41
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:56,600
1, 4, 9, a 6, a 5, and actually if we went to, 8 is 64

42
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,320
so it's a 4. 9 is-- oh we already did that--

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,060
and then 10 is a 0, right? It can also end in a 0.

44
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,600
The choices, A, sure a number can end in 1.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,320
We just figured that out.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,000
Choice B, sure a number can end in 4.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,050
Choice C, sure a number can end in 5. Thus 25 as an example.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,440
Choice D, a number can end in 6.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,260
Choice E, well none of the numbers we looked at end in an 8.

50
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,980
And it seems like there's a bit of a pattern here,

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,370
that it tends to be just a set-- a subset-- of these numbers.

52
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,510
And also we know that the other choices-- choices A through D

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,600
we can figure out perfect squares that end in those numbers.

54
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,490
So we know that the answer is E. Next problem.

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,890
Problem number 10. A bag contains only

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,030
red marbles,blue marbles, and yellow marbles.

57
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,890
The probability of randomly selecting a red marble from

58
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,030
this bag is 1/4.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,060
So I can say the probability of red is equal to 1/4.

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,950
The probability of randomly selecting a blue marble is 1/6.

61
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,070
Which of the following could be the total number of marbles

62
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,700
in the bag? Fascinating.

63
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,140
So what we need to do is we need to essentially figure out

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,010
the ratio of red to blue to yellow marbles.

65
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,910
So first of all,

66
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,040
what's the probability of getting a yellow marble?

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,200
The probability of getting a yellow marble is going to be

68
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,670
1 minus these, right?

69
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:32,070
So probability of yellow is going to be 1 minus 1/6 minus 1/4

70
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,260
Let's see, we could put all of that over 12.

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:44,410
12 minus 2/12 minus 3/12--3/12 is 1/4.

72
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,420
So that equals-- what's 12 minus 10? That equals 7/12.

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,050
So the probability I get a yellow marble is 7/12.

74
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,600
So that means for every 7 marbles--

75
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,890
so let's write it all is a denominator of 12.

76
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,010
That makes it actually a lot easier.

77
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,030
1/6 is the same thing as 2/12.

78
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,670
And 1/4 is the same thing as 3/12.

79
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,020
And they all add up to 12/12.

80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,560
So for every 3 red marbles,

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,370
there are 2 blue marbles and there are 7 yellow marbles.

82
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:32,260
The ratio of red to blue to yellow is equal to 3:2:7.

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,110
And we know we can only get this type of a ratio when

84
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,620
there's a total of 12 marbles, right?

85
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,400
There has to be at least 12 marbles

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,830
or any multiple of 12 marbles, right?

87
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,600
If there's exactly 2 blue marbles,

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,020
then there'll be 3 red and 7 yellow.

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,960
And there has to be at least 2 of the blue marbles.

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,040
So any multiple of 12 marbles will work for

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,010
this type of ratio.

92
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,320
So if we look at the choices, which of the following

93
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,410
could be the total number of marbles in the bag?

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,960
So out of all those choices,

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,320
which of them are a multiple of 12? Well, choice A isn't.

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,850
10 isn't a multiple of 12. Choice C isn't. 18, 20, 30.

97
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,550
Well 12 is a multiple of 12,so choice B is our answer.

98
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,590
And we just figured out.

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,000
If there were 3 red, 2 blue and 7 yellow,

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,610
then we get the correct probabilities.

101
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,180
The key is just to try to figure out what the probability of

102
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,190
getting a yellow is and then realizing the ratios

103
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,250
between the two. Next problem. Problem 11.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,370
When the sum of a list of prices is divided by the

105
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,010
average of the prices the result is k. What does k represent?

106
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,350
So if I take the sum divided by the average.

107
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,510
So let's say I'm taking the sum of three numbers.

108
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:08,020
So let's say, n1 plus n2 plus n3.

109
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,090
I could do it n times, but just for simplicity.

110
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,000
And I'm dividing that by the average. What's the average?

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,070
It's n1 plus n2 plus n3 divided by 3, right?

112
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,240
And if you divide by a fraction,

113
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,010
that's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal.

114
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:37,050
So that's n1 plus n2 plus n3 times 3 over n1 plus n2 plus n3.

115
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,490
So this cancels out, and all we're left with is 3,

116
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,410
which is the number of numbers we had.

117
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,680
And you could have done this with 16 or 20 or whatever.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,020
I mean you could have said n1 plus n2 plus da, da, da, da, da

119
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,370
Where I have, let's say, n sub-- let's say I have m digits--

120
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,830
and then divide that by n1 plus n2 plus blah, blah, blah

121
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,620
n over m. Sub m digits. And say, well I'm dividing by m.

122
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,620
This would have also simplified to m digits.

123
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,880
When you do what they said in the problem,

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,080
the result is just the number of prices that you are summing.

125
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,430
So that is choice D, the number of prices.

126
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,160
And it works out

127
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,220
because this sum and this sum will cancel out. Next problem.

128
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,680
Let's see how fast-- if I can fit this one in.

129
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,000
So I have a drawing. It looks like this.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,070
Let's see, triangle, triangle,triangle, triangle,

131
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,090
and then dotted lines,dotted lines,dotted lines,dotted lines.

132
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,500
It says, if the area of the square in the figure above is 81

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,330
so they're saying this is a square, and if the area is 81

134
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,010
then we know that this side is 9 and this side is 9. Right?

135
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,000
This is 9 times 9.

136
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,860
And the perimeter of each of the four triangles is 30.

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,550
So the perimeter is 30 of each of those.

138
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,450
What is the perimeter of the figure outlined by

139
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,060
the solid line? well think about it.

140
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,940
The perimeter of the solid line, that would be this.

141
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,000
That's what we want to figure out.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,410
Well wouldn't that just be the perimeter of the

143
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,740
four triangles,and then we want to subtract out this side,

144
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,590
this side, this side and this side, right?

145
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,370
The perimeter of the red part is the perimeter of each of

146
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,090
the triangles-- added up, all four of them--

147
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,020
minus the perimeter of the square inside.

148
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,250
So the perimeter of the four triangles is 30 times 4,

149
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,000
minus the perimeter of this,which is minus 27.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,010
No whoops, minus 36. So it's 120 minus 36 and that is--
