1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,190
We're on 76.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,140
In the figure below, line
AB is tangent to

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,000
circle O at point A.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Fair enough.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,040
Secant BD intersects circle
O at points C and D.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,370
   

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,700
Secant just means that
it intersects the

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,800
point at two points.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,590
It's not tangent.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,630
A tangent intersects the circle
at exactly one point.

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,020
Secant BD intersects the circle
at points C and D.

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:38,850
Measure of arc AC is equal to 70
degrees, and the measure of

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,800
arc CD is equal to
110 degrees.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,690
So what do they want
us to figure out?

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,940
What is the measure of ABC?

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,600
   

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,650
So what is this angle?

19
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,930
That's what they want
us to figure out.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,080
They want us to figure
out this right here.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,490
That angle.

22
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,690
Let's see what we can do here.

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,920
So there's a couple of ways
to think about it.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,940
Well, if you look at it, this
is 70, this is 110, right?

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,210
So if you add them, this whole
arc, going for all the way

26
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,320
around, that's 180 degrees.

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,270
So it's actually perfectly
halfway around the circle.

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,380
So actually from A to
D is actually a

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,010
diameter of the circle.

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,760
How do I know that?

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,170
Because it goes all the
way around the circle.

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,925
The arc length is 180 degrees.

33
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:37,180
So we can draw-- let me
draw a diameter line.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,710
I don't know if this thing
is drawn to scale.

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,920
   

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,230
A to D is actually a diameter
of the circle.

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,510
We know that, because that's 180
degrees, the combined arc

38
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,090
length right there.

39
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,535
And we know, that this line
is tangent at point A.

40
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:56,020
   

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,180
So that has to be
a right angle.

42
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,050
When you're tangent at point A,
that means your tangent to

43
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,580
the radius at that point.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,750
Fair enough.

45
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,030
So now let's see what
we can figure out.

46
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,880
We know that this arc
length is 70.

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,640
Is there any way to figure out
what this angle right here is?

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,710
Because if we know this angle,
we know this is 90, then we

49
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,240
could figure out that angle.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,790
And this is something that you
should just learn about

51
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,730
inscribed angles in a circle.

52
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,670
This is an inscribed angle,
because the vertex touches on

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,460
one of the sides
of the circle.

54
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,700
So an inscribed angle-- and this
is just something good to

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,640
memorize, and you could play
around with it to get a little

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,630
bit more intuition about it--
is equal to half of the arc

57
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,320
length that it intersects.

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,790
So this inscribed angle
intersects an arc

59
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,350
length of 70 degrees.

60
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,410
So this is 35 degrees.

61
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,830
And that's just something
good to know.

62
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,190
That this is going to
be half of whatever

63
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,510
this arc length is.

64
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:03,370
Now we can figure out x, because
x plus 35 plus 90 is

65
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,030
equal to 180.

66
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,970
You get x plus 35 is equal to
90. x is equal to 90 minus 35

67
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,660
is 55, which is choice C.

68
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,470
Now there's another way you
can do this, and this is

69
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,800
another interesting thing
about lines that

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,710
intersect in circles.

71
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,800
It's that this angle measure,
right here, if it's sitting

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,470
outside of the circle-- I think
there might be ones

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,440
sitting inside the circle later
on-- but if it's sitting

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,120
outside of the circle, it's
equal to 1/2 the difference of

75
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,970
the arc measures that
it intersects.

76
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,980
So for example, it intersects
this arc measure of 70, and it

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,940
also has this arc measure
right here.

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,250
   

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,485
When it hits the circle and
intersects at 70 degrees and

80
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:02,430
when it exits the circle,
it has this arc measure.

81
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,150
This arc measure we already
figured out.

82
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,290
It's 180 degrees, because
that's 180 degrees.

83
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,850
So you know that this angle
right here, you could say that

84
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,100
x is equal to 1/2 the difference
of these two arc

85
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,149
measures, and we can do
that because x is

86
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,160
outside of the circle.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,100
If x was inside the circle, then
x would be 1/2 the sum of

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,720
the two measures.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
So what's the difference?

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,670
It's 180 minus 70.

91
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,910
So that's equal to 1/2 times
110, so that is equal to 55.

92
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,210
So it's nice to see that math
works correctly no matter how

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,190
you do the problem.

94
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,830
Problem 77: In the circle shown
below, the measure of

95
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,730
arc PR is 140 degrees.

96
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,710
Sure enough.

97
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,530
The measure of angle
RPQ is 50 degrees.

98
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,410
OK, that's 50 degrees.

99
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,360
What is the measure of arc PQ?

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,700
What is this arc right there?

101
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,950
So we could use what we learned
in the last problem.

102
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,760
50 degrees is an inscribed
angle.

103
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,860
So it's going to be half of
the arc length measured in

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,810
degrees, or arc angle, I guess
you could say, of the arc that

105
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,000
it intercepts.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,880
So this is 50, then this
arc measure is

107
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,820
going to be 100 degrees.

108
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,630
So what we're trying to figure
out, this arc measure right

109
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,960
here, it's whatever you
really have left over.

110
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
Let's call this x.

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:45,570
So we know that x plus 100 plus
140, well, that goes all

112
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,590
the way around the
circle, right?

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,310
That's going to be equal
to 360 degrees.

114
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,120
So you have x plus 240 is
equal to 360 degrees.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,130
Subtract 240 from both sides,
and you get x is

116
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,080
equal to 120 degrees.

117
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,330
Choice D.

118
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,600
   

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,430
Problem 78: The vertices of
triangle ABC are A is 2 comma

120
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,370
1, B is 3 comma 4, and
C is 1 comma 3.

121
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,310
If triangle ABC is translated
one unit down-- so one unit

122
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,890
down means that we're
subtracting 1 from the y's--

123
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,340
and three units to the left--
so that means you're

124
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,250
subtracting 3 from the x's-- to
create triangle DEF, what

125
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,270
are the coordinates of
the vertices of DEF?

126
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,290
So let's see, we have
A is 2 comma 1.

127
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:48,020
   

128
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,830
And that's going to be
translated to point D.

129
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,330
What do they say?

130
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,570
One unit down.

131
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,270
One unit down means the
y decreases by 1.

132
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,500
So the y-coordinate's going
to be-- decrease that

133
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,180
by 1, you get 0.

134
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,300
And three units to the left,
that means you decrease the

135
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,190
x-coordinate by 3.

136
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,260
So 2 minus 3 is negative one.

137
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,170
Actually, just looking at the
choices, we're already done.

138
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,150
D is the only choice that had
a negative 1 comma 0.

139
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,530
But let's look at
the other ones.

140
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,120
Maybe somehow they changed the
lettering or something.

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,916
Let's see point B
was 3 comma 4.

142
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:28,230
   

143
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,290
So what do we do?

144
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,850
With x, we said three units
to the left, so that

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,580
becomes point E.

146
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,020
So you take this three
units to left.

147
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,630
You're subtracting 3 from
there, that becomes 0.

148
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,170
If you take the y-coordinate
one unit down,

149
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,260
that becomes a 3.

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,000
So E is 0 comma 3.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,270
So that's still consistent
with this.

152
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,300
And let's just make sure
that the F works.

153
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,625
So C was 1 comma 3.

154
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,690
   

155
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,530
If we take 3 away, we shift it
to the left by 3, so that's

156
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,110
taking 3 away from the
x-coordinate, so

157
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,590
that's minus 2.

158
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,320
And if you're shifting the
y-coordinate down one, that's

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,220
taking 1 from it, so that's 3,
so F is minus 2 comma 2.

160
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,090
And so D was definitely
the answer.

161
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:20,460
Problem 79: If triangle ABC is
rotated 180 degrees about the

162
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,640
origin, what are the coordinates
of A prime?

163
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,390
OK, so we're going to rotate
this thing 180 degrees.

164
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,390
And essentially, we can worry
about all the coordinates, but

165
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,270
they just want to know where A
prime is, so wherever A sits

166
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,220
after we've rotated it.

167
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,650
So let's think about
it a little bit.

168
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,370
When we've rotated the C, this
is going to be the new C.

169
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,620
It's going to be right there.

170
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,020
   

171
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,130
B is going to be, when you
rotate it-- I just want to

172
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,330
make sure I'm doing
this right.

173
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,870
This is almost like a
visualization problem.

174
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:12,310
If you go four to the
right and up three.

175
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,190
So if you were to rotate
it around.

176
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,710
Let's say this little arrow I
drew with the four, if I were

177
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,450
to rotate that 180 degrees-- I
just want to make sure I do it

178
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,850
right-- then that's going
to be four this way.

179
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,200
   

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,740
So you're going to
be at that point.

181
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,330
And then instead of three up,
you're going to go three down.

182
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,760
   

183
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,950
So that's where A prime
is going to be.

184
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,790
Right at that point.

185
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,010
And that's the point minus
five comma minus four.

186
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,720
   

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,440
And that's our answer.

188
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,020
But let's figure out all
of the other points.

189
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,360
So B, you go up three and
to the right two.

190
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:18,570
   

191
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,870
The new B, you'd go three
down to the left.

192
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,560
OK, it would be there.

193
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,530
So that's the new B.

194
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:25,870
Right.

195
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,370
And so that looks right.

196
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,310
That's what the triangle
is going to look like.

197
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,170
This is B prime, this is A
prime, this is C prime.

198
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,010
This is the new triangle when
you rotate it 180 degrees.

199
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,040
That was a challenging
visualization problem, but the

200
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,620
key thing is just to
keep visualizing

201
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,900
going around 180 degrees.

202
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,660
So minus five comma
minus four, that's

203
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,160
choice A for A prime.

204
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,930
Problem 80: Trapezoid ABCD below
is to be translated to

205
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,750
trapezoid A prime, B prime,
C prime, D prime by the

206
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,610
following motion rule.

207
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,000
What will be the coordinates
of vertex C prime?

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,780
OK, so that's all we have
to worry about.

209
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,100
We're at C and we're going to
translate it to some C prime.

210
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,350
What of the coordinates of C?

211
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,010
   

212
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,220
x is equal to five, and
y is equal to 1.

213
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,210
So what's C prime going
to be equal to?

214
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,280
C prime, we'll just use
this mapping rule.

215
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,290
You add 3 to the x, so it's
going to be 8, and you

216
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,000
subtract 4 from the y.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
1 minus 4 is minus 3.

218
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,980
8 minus 3.

219
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,880
That's choice D.

220
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,610
And we're all done.

221
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,195
We're all done with the entire
California Standards geometry

222
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:48,870
test. And frankly, I started
off grumbling a little bit,

223
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,300
because I thought they were
getting a little bit too

224
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,740
obsessed with the terminology.

225
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,730
But overall, I think this was a
pretty good test. And if you

226
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,790
understood every problem on this
exam, I think you know

227
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,670
your geometry pretty well.

228
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,930
Anyway, see you in the next
video, although this is the

229
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,380
last in this geometry series.

230
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,400
