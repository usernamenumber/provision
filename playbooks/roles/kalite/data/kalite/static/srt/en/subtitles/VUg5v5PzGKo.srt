1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,390
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,165
We're on problem number 7.

4
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:06,320
   

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,110
If a and b are positive
integers, and a squared minus

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,575
b squared is equal to 7,
what is the value of a?

7
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:27,450
   

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,060
So there's a couple of ways that
I would think about this.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,470
You could say-- well, this
is actually the way I

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,450
would think about it.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,700
Whenever I see something squared
minus something, I

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,510
immediately just want to factor
it, and we'll see where

13
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,910
that gets us.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,370
You get that a plus b times
a minus b is equal to 7.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,280
And we know that a and b
are positive integers.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
   

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,470
Well, we know this is going to
be a positive integer, right?

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,870
You add two positive integers,
you definitely

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,340
get a positive integer.

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,610
And then we also know that
this is going to

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,080
be a positive integer.

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,180
How do I know that?

23
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,200
Well, when I multiply a
positive integer times

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,310
something and I get another
positive integer or I get

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,430
another positive number,
I know that whatever I

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,110
multiplied by is positive,
right?

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,370
Because a positive times
a positive is positive.

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,120
So what does this say?

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,080
So these are both positive
integers, and when I multiply

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,250
them, I get 7.

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,740
So what could they be?

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,260
Well, what numbers when you
multiply it can be 7?

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,230
Well, there's only
two choices.

34
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,230
1 times 7 because 7 is prime.

35
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,750
7 has no other factors
other than 1 and 7.

36
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,080
So which one's going to be 7 and
which one's going to be 1?

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,730
Well, the larger one's
going to be 7.

38
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,230
And the smaller one's
going to be 1.

39
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,300
So you could eyeball this.

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,950
You could say, well, what two
numbers when I add them

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,130
together is 7 and when I
subtract them, I get 1?

42
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,145
And you can say, well, what
if a is 4 and b is 3?

43
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,620
And that works.

44
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,380
4 plus 3 is 7.

45
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,220
4 minus 3 is 1.

46
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,480
And if that didn't just dawn
on you all of a sudden, you

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,490
could do a system
of equations.

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,290
a plus b is equal to 7.

49
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,690
a minus b is equal to 1.

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,740
Add these two equations.

51
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,550
You get 2a.

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,370
The b's cancel out.

53
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,510
Plus 0 is equal to 8.

54
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,940
7 plus 1 is 8.

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,360
a is equal to 4.

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,100
Then you can substitute back
in or just play around with

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,150
the numbers, and you get
b is equal to 3.

58
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,530
So that is choice-- oh, they
want to just know what a is.

59
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,010
So a is 4, which is choice B.

60
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,330
   

61
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,580
Next problem.

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,490
   

63
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,986
You have a number line here.

64
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,700
Let me draw it nice and big.

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,940
I don't know how much
space I'll need.

66
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:53,280
   

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Have 0 in the middle.

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,100
   

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,890
Negative 1, 1.

70
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:13,820
Let me draw these points
now: t, u, v, and w.

71
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:22,560
   

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,085
And then you have
x and y here.

73
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,830
   

74
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,080
And then you have z.

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,050
   

76
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,360
On the number line above,
which of the following

77
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,130
corresponds to the absolute
value of u minus v?

78
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,860
And this is just an
approximation problem.

79
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,500
You might get intimidated, like,
how do I figure out u?

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,440
How do I figure out v?

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,020
Well, the answer is you
just kind of guess.

82
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,800
Well, you don't guess.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,220
You approximate.

84
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,840
So let's see.

85
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,570
What does u look like?

86
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,570
u looks like-- I don't know.

87
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,250
If you're eyeballing it, it
looks like minus 0.8, if I

88
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:02,960
were to eyeball it.

89
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,670
Maybe a little more?

90
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,820
Minus 0.85?

91
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,420
Because it's almost
at negative 1, but

92
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,240
not all the way there.

93
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,870
I don't think it's 9/10 there.

94
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,470
Yeah, I would say minus 0.85.

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,690
I'm just eyeballing it.

96
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,459
So let's just say u is
equal to minus 0.85.

97
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,380
And what's v?

98
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,840
v looks about 2/3
on the way to u.

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,310
So let's say v is equal
to minus 0.6.

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,530
Once again I'm just-- let's
say minus 0.66.

101
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,970
I'm just approximating
once again.

102
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,970
So it's minus, right?

103
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,430
And they're both negative
numbers, and they're both

104
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,980
almost at 1.

105
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,020
So what is the absolute
value of u minus v?

106
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,700
Well, that's the absolute value
of minus 0.85 minus v.

107
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,790
So minus minus 0.66.

108
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,570
So the minus minus
becomes a plus.

109
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,970
So what's minus 0.85
plus 0.66?

110
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,300
Well, that's roughly
minus 0.19.

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,960
And if I'm taking the absolute
value of that,

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,200
that becomes 0.19.

113
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,360
0.19, roughly 1/5, and there's
no other number around.

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,220
Roughly 1/5 is around here, and
there's no other number

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,310
there even remotely close,
so that's going to be x.

116
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,800
And another way you could have
thought about that, if you

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,490
didn't want to approximate,
use numbers.

118
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,900
I do that just to make sure.

119
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,010
The absolute value, when you
subtract two numbers and you

120
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,320
take the absolute value, you're
essentially saying,

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,710
well, what's the distance
between the two?

122
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,990
What's the positive distance?

123
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,610
I don't care whether one's
larger or one's

124
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,700
less than the other.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,250
So you're essentially saying
what's this distance, this

126
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,510
distance here that's equal to
this, to this expression?

127
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,670
So that distance, that
positive distance, is

128
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,250
approximately equal to x, even
in my not-exact drawing.

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,740
And if you look at how they drew
it-- actually, even in

130
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,130
the way they drew it.

131
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,220
Oh, sorry!

132
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,070
They did u minus w.

133
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,130
So then it actually makes even
more sense, because w

134
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,380
is more like 0.5.

135
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,970
   

136
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,140
I misread the problem.

137
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,640
This w is equal to
more like 0.5.

138
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,800
So the absolute value of u minus
w is going to be equal

139
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,730
to the absolute value of 0.85--
sorry, w is minus 0.5.

140
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,700
It's in the negative domain,
so minus 0.85 minus 0.5, so

141
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,230
that equals minus 0.35.

142
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,380
Absolute value is equal to 0.35,
still is equal to x.

143
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,560
And they did that.

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,550
I was just approximating
that x still works.

145
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,180
But according to the drawing,
it makes even more sense

146
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,570
because we're actually talking
about this distance.

147
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,090
Sorry, to w.

148
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,820
Let me do it in a different
better color.

149
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,240
This is what u-- not this.

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,260
This is what this represents.

151
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,620
The absolute value of u minus
w represents this distance.

152
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,250
And that distance is the
same as the value of x.

153
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,082
And it really makes sense if you
just look at the distance

154
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,230
between u and w in the book.

155
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,670
It's almost exact.

156
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,960
This actually looks like
it was drawn to scale.

157
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,780
Next problem.

158
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,160
And that's choice
C either way.

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
Even when I did it wrong
the first way.

160
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,830
I didn't do it wrong,
I misread.

161
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,040
To give myself a little
bit of credit.

162
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
Problem number 9.

163
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
Although you won't get much
credit if you misread

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,280
when you take it.

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,200
A number n is increased by 5.

166
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,210
I write these out as I read
them, is increased by 5, and

167
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,130
the result is multiplied by 5.

168
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,860
   

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,070
This result is decreased by 5.

170
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,455
Finally, that result
is divided by 5.

171
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:43,140
   

172
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,020
The whole result is
divided by 5.

173
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,220
In terms of n, what is
the final result?

174
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,850
Well, what can we do here?

175
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,180
We can divide the numerator
and denominator by 5.

176
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,470
So this 5 will cancel out with
this and this, right?

177
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,670
Because you distribute.

178
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:04,160
So you're left with n plus
5 times 1, right?

179
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,170
Because this just becomes
a 1, this becomes a 1,

180
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,240
this become a 1.

181
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,850
n plus 5 times 1-- I won't
write the 1, because it

182
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,730
doesn't matter anymore--
minus 1.

183
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,064
All of that over 1.

184
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:17,480
So we could just ignore that.

185
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,030
So it's n plus 5 minus 1.

186
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,410
Well, it's n plus 4.

187
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,810
Just get rid of the
parentheses.

188
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,980
Plus 5 minus 1 is n plus 4.

189
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,530
And so that's choice D.

190
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,669
Let's see if I have space
to do the next problem.

191
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,990
Or time, actually,
more than space.

192
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,840
I will actually wait to do it
in the next video, just so I

193
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,570
don't rush things, which
I tend to do.

194
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,090
See you soon.

195
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,333
