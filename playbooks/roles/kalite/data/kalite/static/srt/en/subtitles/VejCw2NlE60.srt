00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,710
What I want to do in this video is prove

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
that the circumcenter of a right triangle,

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,990
is actually the midpoint of the hypotenuse, and to do that,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm gonna take, first take a look at the perpendicular bisector

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,880
of one of the legs, of this, of this right triangle

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,600
So, let me construct the perpendicular bisector

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,330
of leg BC right over here, so it's going to look something like this,

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,000
it's going to look something like this, this,

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,480
it intersects at a right angle, its perpendicular, and it bisects it

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,540
So B, this is from B to this point

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,800
which we'll call M, maybe M for midpoint,

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,770
is the same, as it is from M to C,

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,230
so those two distances are going to be equal,

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,130
and let's call the point where this perpendicular bisector

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,660
intersects the hypotenuse,

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,110
let's call this O,and we're gonna prove that O

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,300
is the circumcenter of this right triangle

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,550
Now, the first thing that you might realize,

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,530
and this is what we've seen in many problems,

20
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,670
the triangle OBM, looks similar to triangle ABC,

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,400
and its actually not too hard to prove,

22
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,600
they both already have a 90 degree angle,

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,260
so if we show that they, they both have another angle

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,870
Another set of corresponding angles

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,520
that are congruent to each other, then we know that they're similar

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,490
By AA similarity, and they both clearly share this angle,

27
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,250
right over here, OBC is part of the smaller triangle,

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,710
and ABC which is really the same angle,

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,070
is part of the larger triangle, and so, and they also obviously share

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,870
a 90 degree angle, so by AA triangle similarity,

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:40,700
we have triangle OBM, OBM is similar, is similar to triangle ABC,

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:47,350
is similar to triangle ABC, and what's useful about this?

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,530
Is we know similar triangles are ratios between corresponding sides

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,270
are constant, so for example, we know that the ratio between side BM,

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,290
which is on the smaller triangle, we know that the ratio between BM

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,740
Let me do this in a different color, just to, just for the sake of it,

37
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,840
we know that the ratio between BM

38
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,500
and BC, BM and BC, the ratio of this side on the smaller

39
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,740
triangle to the corresponding side on the larger triangle

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,030
Is going to be the same as the ratio of the hypotenuse

41
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,510
on the smaller triangle, BO to the hypotenuse of the larger triangle,

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,280
because they are similar, well we know what the ratio of BM to BC is,

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,150
BM is half of BC, so this ratio over here

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,550
is going to be equal to one half, this is M is the bi,

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,590
of the midpoint of these things,

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,200
so this is exactly the same distance as this,

47
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,640
so this is one half of the entire BC,

48
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,430
so if one half is equal to BM, over BC is equal to BO over BA

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,740
We then know, if we just kind of ignore this middle part,

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,970
right over here, that one half is equal to BO over BA,

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,900
over BA, if you cross multiply it,

52
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,590
if you cross multiply, you see that, well there's multiple ways

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,760
to think about, but you could just cross multiply, and you say BA,

54
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,130
is equal to 2BO, or if you divide both sides by two,

55
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,990
and their really equivalent statements one half BA is equal to BO,

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,420
so BO is one half of BA, so this is one half BA,

57
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,530
and so this other length, AO right over here

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,760
This is going to be B, this is going to be, this going to be BA,

59
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,810
minus one half BA, so this is also going to be, one half BA,

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,950
and so, this segment right over here,

61
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,420
AO, AO is going to be congruent to OB

62
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,110
So what we just shown, first of all,

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,590
is that this perpendicular bisector, right over here,

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,360
The perpendicular bisector of segment BC,

65
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,890
it intersects the hypotenuse of our right triangle at the midpoint,

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,440
So we've already established,

67
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,350
so we, one thing that we've already established,

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,950
is O, is the midpoint, is the midpoint,

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,950
of the hypotenuse, of the hypotenuse, of the hypotenuse AB,

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,780
well, that by itself is interesting,

71
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,180
but, we also know that if a point sits on a perpendicular bisector

72
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,220
of a segment, is equidistant, it's equal distant

73
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,490
from the end point of the segment, we'd show that in a previous video

74
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,730
So we also know that O, OB that's equidistant to the end points

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,550
of the segment, right over here, that OB is equal to OC, but we know,

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,190
from this first statement right over here,

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,510
that OB is alsoequal to OA, OB is also equal to OA,

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,410
its of OB is equal to OC

79
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,900
OB is equal to OA, that means OC must be equal to OA,

80
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,850
OC must be equal to OA

81
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,600
Or another way to think about it, is at this point O,

82
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,570
Is equal distant from all of the points on our tri,

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,860
all of the vertices, I should say, this point O is equidistant,

84
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,320
from all of the vertices of our triangle, of our triangle,

85
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,170
So this distance, this distance, which is really going to become

86
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,290
our circumradius, is the same as this distance right over here,

87
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,540
which is the same as this distance right over there

88
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,850
So that we know that O is equidistant,

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,480
equidistant to all, all vertices, which is another way of saying

90
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,570
that O is the circumcenter, O is the circumcenter, so we've just

91
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,300
proven that if you have the circumcenter of a right triangle,

92
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,660
it is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle,

93
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,920
or the other way around, that the hypotenuse of the right triangle

94
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,320
is the circumcenter, because you only have one circumcenter of any,

95
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,880
of any triangle
