1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,640
I'm now going to show you what
I think are probably the two

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,490
coolest derivatives
in all of calculus.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,680
And I'll reserve that.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,850
None of the other ones have
occurred to me right now.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,780
But these are definitely to
me some of the neatest.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,795
So let's figure out
what the derivative of

8
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:16,810
the natural log is.

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,530
And just as a review,
what is the natural log?

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,380
Well the natural log of
something is the exact same

11
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,720
thing as saying logarithm
base e of that something.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,810
That's just a review.

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,390
So let's take the
derivative of this.

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,440
   

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,455
I think I'm going to need
a lot of space for this.

16
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,430
I'm going to try to do it
as neatly as possible.

17
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:47,090
So the derivative of the
natural log of x equals-- well

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,780
let's just take the definition
of a derivative, right?

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,780
We just take the slope at some
point and find the limit as we

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,720
take the difference between
the two points to 0.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:08,240
So let's take the limit as
delta x approaches 0 of

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,340
f of x plus delta x.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,440
So I'm going to take the
limit of this whole thing.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,450
The natural log ln of x plus
delta x-- right, that's like

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,660
one point that I'm going to
take evaluate the function--

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,490
minus the ln of x.

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,010
All of that over delta x.

28
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,250
And if you remember from the
derivative videos, this is just

29
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,670
the slope, and I'm just taking
the limit as I find the slope

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,040
between a smaller and
a smaller distance.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,476
Hopefully you remember that.

32
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:44,800
So let's see if we can do some
logarithm properties to

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,530
simplify this a little bit.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,820
Hopefully you remember-- and if
you don't, review the logarithm

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:57,480
properties-- but remember that
log of a minus log of b is

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,390
equal to log of a over b, and
that comes out of the fact that

37
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,930
logarithm expressions are
essentially exponents, so they

38
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,710
follow the exponent rules.

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,180
And if that doesn't make
sense to you, you should

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,580
review those as well.

41
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,090
But let's apply this logarithm
property to this equation.

42
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,110
So let me rewrite the whole
thing, and I'm going to keep

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,580
switching colors to keep it
from getting monotonous.

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:26,780
So we have the limit as delta x
approaches 0 of this big thing.

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,230
Let's see.

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,060
So log of a minus b equals log
a over b, so this top, the

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,120
numerator, will equal the
natural log of x plus

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,270
delta x over x.

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,000
Right? a b a/b, all of
that over delta x.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,350
   

51
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:58,090
And so that equals the limit as
delta x approaches 0-- I think

52
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,240
it's time to switch colors
again-- delta x approaches 0

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,025
of-- well let me just write
this 1 over delta

54
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,730
x out in front.

55
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,010
So this is 1 over delta x,
and we're going to take

56
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,000
the limit of everything.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,270
ln x divided by x is 1
plus delta x over x.

58
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,580
Fair enough.

59
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,770
Now I'm going to throw out
another logarithm property, and

60
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,130
hopefully you remember that--
and let me put the properties

61
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,440
separate so you know it's not
part of the proof-- that a log

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,290
b is equal to log
of b to the a.

63
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,890
And that comes from when you
take something to an exponent,

64
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,300
and then to another exponent
you just have to multiply

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,670
those two exponents.

66
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,890
I don't want to confuse
you, but hopefully you

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,370
should remember this.

68
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,710
So how does apply here?

69
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,330
Well this would be a log b.

70
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:09,020
So this expression is the
same thing as the limit.

71
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:23,740
The limit as delta x approaches
0 of the natural log of 1 plus

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,800
delta x over x to the
1 over delta x power.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,820
And remember all this
is the natural log of

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,890
this entire thing.

75
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,730
And then we're going
to take the limit as

76
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,110
delta x approaches 0.

77
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,270
If you've watched the compound
interest problems and you know

78
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,480
the definition of e, I think
this will start to

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,190
look familiar.

80
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,030
But let me make a substitution
that might clean things

81
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,410
up a little bit.

82
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:59,190
Let me make the substitution,
let me call it n-- no, no, no,

83
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,430
let me call u-- is equal
to delta x over x.

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,860
And then if that's true
then we can multiply both

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,450
sides by x and we get
xu is equal to delta x.

86
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,650
Or we would also know
that 1 over delta x is

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,780
equal to 1 over xu.

88
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,150
These are all equivalent.

89
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,720
So let's make the substitution.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,030
So if we're taking the limit is
delta x approaches 0, in this

91
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,930
expression if delta x
approaches 0, what

92
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,110
does u approach?

93
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,320
u approaches 0.

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,860
So delta x approaching 0 is the
same exact thing as taking

95
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,230
the limit as u approaches 0.

96
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,960
So we can write this as the
limit as u approaches 0 of the

97
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,200
natural log of 1 plus-- well we
did the substitution, delta x

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,870
over x is now u-- to the 1
over delta x, and that same

99
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,960
substitution told us that's the
same thing as one over xu.

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,270
   

101
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,360
Remember we're taking the
natural log of everything.

102
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,550
And we know this is an exponent
property, which I'll now

103
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,340
do in a different color.

104
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,530
We know that a to the bc
is equal to a to the

105
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,620
b to the c power.

106
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:35,200
So that tells us that this me
is equal to the limit as u

107
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:46,810
approaches 0 of the natural log
of 1 plus u to the 1/u, because

108
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,960
this is one over xu, right?

109
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,270
1/u, and then all of
that to the 1/x.

110
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,110
And how did I do that?

111
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,950
Just from this exponent
property, right?

112
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,810
If I were to simplify this, I
would have 1/x times 1/u, and

113
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,740
that's where I get
this 1 over xu.

114
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,780
Well then we can just do this
logarithm property in reverse.

115
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,370
If I have b to the a I can
put that a out front.

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,670
So I could take this 1/x
and put it in front

117
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,160
of the natural log.

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,250
So now what do I have?

119
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,550
We're almost there.

120
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:25,780
We have the limit
as u approaches 0.

121
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,950
Take that 1/x, put it in front
of the natural log sign.

122
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:40,490
1/x times the natural log
of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

123
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,330
Fair enough.

124
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,080
When we're taking the limit as
u approaches 0, x, this term

125
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,800
doesn't involve it at all.

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,030
So we could take this out in
front, because the limit

127
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,430
doesn't affect this term.

128
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,890
And then we're essentially
saying what happens to this

129
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,440
expression as the limit
as u approaches 0.

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:10,220
So this thing is equivalent to
1/x times the natural log of

131
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:23,480
the limit as u approaches
0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,320
And by now hopefully you
would recognize that

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,880
this is the definition.

134
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,230
This limit comes to e, if
you remember anything

135
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,260
from compound interest.

136
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,140
You might remember it as the
limit-- as n approaches

137
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,430
infinity of 1 plus
1 over n to the n.

138
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,780
But these things
are equivalent.

139
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,360
If you just took the
substitution u is equal to

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,330
1/n, you would get this.

141
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,180
You would just get this.

142
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,500
So this expression right here
is e That expression is e.

143
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,670
So we're getting close.

144
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,570
   

145
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:05,760
So this whole thing is
equivalent to 1/x times

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,050
the natural log, and this
we know, this is one of

147
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,740
the ways to get to e.

148
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,280
So the limit as u approaches
0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u.

149
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,000
That is e.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,030
And what is the natural log?

151
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,530
Well it's the log base e.

152
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:23,000
So you know this is equal to
1/x times the log base e of e.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,270
So that's saying e
to what power is e.

154
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,870
Well e to the first
power is e, right?

155
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,400
This is equal to 1.

156
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,010
So 1 times 1/x is equal to 1/x.

157
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,280
There we have it.

158
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,190
The derivative of the natural
log of x is equal to 1/x, which

159
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,260
I find kind of neat, because
all of the other exponents

160
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,280
lead to another exponent.

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,580
But all of a sudden in the mix
here you have the natural log

162
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,440
and the derivative of that
is equal to x to the

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,420
negative 1 or 1/x.

164
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,740
Fascinating.

165
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,500
