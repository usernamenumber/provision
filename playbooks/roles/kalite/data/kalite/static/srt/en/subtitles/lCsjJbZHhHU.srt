1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,136
When you get into higher mathmatics you might see a professor write something like

2
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:08,668
this on a board like this R with this extra backbone right over here

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,882
and maybe they write R2

4
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:14,468
or if you're looking at it in a book, it might just be a bolded capital R

5
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:17,668
with a 2 superscript like this

6
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:23,670
and if you see this they are referring to the 2-dimensional real coordinate space..

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,467
real coordinate space..

8
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:30,338
which sounds very fancy.. real coordinate space

9
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:33,735
but one way to think about it, its really just a 2-dimensional space

10
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,217
that you're used to dealing with in your coordinate plane.

11
00:00:37,217 --> 00:00:43,136
To go a little more abstract, this isn't necessarily, this visual representation

12
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:47,633
this visual representation is one way to think about this real coordinate space

13
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:52,548
if we were to think about it a little more abstractly, the real R two

14
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:56,204
the 2-dimensional real coordinate space.. let me write this down..

15
00:00:56,204 --> 00:01:02,737
the 2-dimensional real coordinate space, and just to break down the notation

16
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:06,547
the 2 tells us how many dimensions we're dealing with, and the R tells us

17
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:11,271
this is a real coordinate space. The 2-dimensional real coordinate space is all

18
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:16,069
the possible real valued 2-tuples.

19
00:01:16,069 --> 00:01:19,811
let me write that down.. this is all possible

20
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:31,001
all possible real valued 2-tuples

21
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:37,267
so what is a 2-tuple? Well, a tuple is an ordered list of numbers

22
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:41,147
and since we are talking about real values it's going to be an ordered list of real numbers

23
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:44,981
and a 2-tuple just says it's an ordered list of two numbers.

24
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,270
So this is an ordered list of two real valued numbers. Well, that's exactly what we did here

25
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,870
when we thought about a 2-dimensional vector. This right over here is a 2-tuple.

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,735
And this is a real valued 2-tuple. Neither of these have any

27
00:01:56,735 --> 00:02:01,002
imaginary parts, so you have a 3 and a 4.. order matters!

28
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,810
We view this as a different 2-tuple than say

29
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,000
than say, 4, 3.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,267
Even if we would try to represent them in our

31
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:17,645
axis right over here, this vector 4, 3 would be four along the horizontal axis

32
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:21,971
and then 3 along the vertical axis.

33
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,799
And so it would look something like this. And remember

34
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:28,853
we don't have to draw it just over there, we just care about it's magnitude and direction.

35
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,251
We could draw it right over here.

36
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:36,318
This would also be 4, 3.

37
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,499
The column vector 4, 3. So when we're talking about R2, we're talking about

38
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:44,252
all of the possible real valued 2-tuples. So all of the

39
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:48,186
possible vectors that you can have where each

40
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:52,186
of it's components, and the components are these numbers right over here,

41
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:56,252
where each of it's components are a real number.

42
00:02:56,252 --> 00:02:59,651
So you might have 3, 4. You could have -3, -4.

43
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:04,586
So that would be one, two, three, one, two, three, four.

44
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:07,986
It might look something like.. Actually I should make this scale a little bit bigger

45
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:11,987
so it looks the same, one, two three, four,

46
00:03:11,987 --> 00:03:15,473
So it might look something like

47
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:18,986
that, so that would be the vector -3

48
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:22,724
Let me write it a little better than that, -3

49
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:27,118
and -4, so if you were to take all of the possible 2-tuples

50
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:30,816
including the vector zero, zero, so it has no magnitude

51
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:35,649
you could debate what it's direction is right over there, you take all of those

52
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,892
combined and then you have created your 2-dimensional

53
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:43,253
real coordinate space, and that is referred to as R2.

54
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:46,651
Now as you could imagine, the fact that we wrote this two here, we had to specify it

55
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:49,890
like hey, could I put a 3 there? And I would say absolutely

56
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,722
you could put a 3 there, so R3 would be the

57
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:58,318
3-dimensional real coordinate real space. So 3D real

58
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,784
coordinate space.

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,919
And so you would view this as all the possible real

60
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,277
valued 3-tuples

61
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:13,116
real valued 3-tuples.

62
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:17,784
So for example, that would be

63
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:21,388
a member of R3, let me actually label

64
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:24,650
these vectors so we get in the habit of it, so lets say this vector

65
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,386
we call this vector x, lets say we have a vector b,

66
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:34,859
that looks like this, -1, 5, 3.

67
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:40,027
Both of these would be members of R3. And if you want to see some fancy notation

68
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:44,454
a member of a set, so this is a member

69
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:47,585
this is a member of R3

70
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:51,361
It is a real valued 3-tuple. Now you say

71
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:55,527
well what would be not a member of R3? Well this right over here isn't a 3-tuple.

72
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:59,191
This right over here is a member of R2, now you might be able to extend it in some way

73
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:03,316
add a zero or something, but formally this is not a 3-tuple.

74
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:07,584
Another thing that would not be a member of R3, lets say someone wanted

75
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:11,278
to make some type of vector that had

76
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:15,984
some imaginary parts in it, so lets say it had i, 0, 1.

77
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,852
This is no longer real valued, we have put

78
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:23,612
we have put an imaginary, this number up here has an imaginary

79
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:28,820
part, so this is no longer a real valued 3-tuple.

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,653
And what's neat about linear algebra is that we don't have to stop

81
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:34,585
there, R3 we can visualize. We can plot these things.

82
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,569
We've already, probably in your previous mathematical career, especially if you have some type

83
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:42,403
of a hologram or something, it's not hard to visualize things in three dimensions.

84
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:46,518
But what's neat is that we can keep extending this. We can go to 4, 5, 6, 7

85
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:50,321
20, a 100 dimensions, and obviously there it becomes much harder

86
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,186
if not impossible to visualize it, but then we could at least

87
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:58,486
represent it mathematically with a n-tuple vectors,

88
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:01,252
so if we were to talk about a real coordinate space generally,

89
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:06,487
we'll often see the notation Rn, with n as a superscript.

90
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,263
So this right over here is a n-dimensional

91
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:13,595
n-dimensional real coordinate space.

92
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:17,595
Real coordinate space.
