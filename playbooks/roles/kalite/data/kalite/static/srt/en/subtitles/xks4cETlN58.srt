1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,456
Let's say that f(x) is equal to x over the square root of x^2+1

2
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:18,675
and I want to think about the limit of f(x) as x approaches positive infinity

3
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:25,289
and the limit of f(x) as x approaches neagative infinity.

4
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,271
So let's think about what these are going to be.

5
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:32,336
Well, once again, and I'm not doing this in an ultra-rigorous way but more in an intuitive way

6
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:36,070
is to think about what this function approximately equals

7
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,706
as we get larger and larger and larger x'es.

8
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:44,205
This is the case if we're getting very positive x'es, in very positive infinity direction or very negative.

9
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:48,855
Still the absolute value of those x'es are very very very large as we approach positive infinity

10
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:50,737
or negative infinity.

11
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:54,003
Well, in the numerator we only have only 1 term -- we have this x term --

12
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:57,288
-- but in the denominator we have 2 terms under the radical here.

13
00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:01,404
And as x gets larger and larger and larger either in the positive or the negative direction

14
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:05,700
this x squared term is going to really dominate this one

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,205
You can imagine, when x is 1 million, you're going to have a million squared plus one.

16
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:13,470
The value of the denominator is going to be dictated by this x squared term.

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:22,123
So this is going to be approximately equal to x over the square root of x squared.

18
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:29,335
This term right over here, the 1 isn't going to matter so much when we get very very very large x'es.

19
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:34,671
And this right over here -- x over the square root of x squared or x over the principle root of x squared --

20
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,739
-- this is going to be equal to x over --

21
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,374
-- if I square something and then take the principle root --

22
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:43,069
-- remember that the principle root is the positive square root of something --

23
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,373
-- then I'm essentially taking the absolute value of x.

24
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:49,737
This is going to be equal to x over the absolute value of x

25
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:57,072
for x approaches infinity or for x approaches negative infinity.

26
00:01:57,072 --> 00:02:00,337
So, another way to say this, another way to restate these limits,

27
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:04,803
is as we approach infinity, this limit, we can restate it as the limit,

28
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:11,623
this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches infinity of x over the absolute value of x.

29
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:15,289
Now, for positive x'es the absolute value of x is just going to be x.

30
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,958
This is going to be x divided by x, so this is just going to be 1.

31
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,621
Similarly, right over here, we take the limit as we go to negative infinity,

32
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:29,737
this is going to be the limit of x over the absolute value of x as x approaches negative infinity.

33
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:35,003
Remember, the only reason I was able to make this statement is that f(x) and this thing right over here

34
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:39,573
become very very similar, you can kind of say converge to each other,

35
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:45,538
as x gets very very very large or x gets very very very very negative.

36
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:50,969
Now, for negative values of x the absolute value of x is going to be positive,

37
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:55,580
x is obviously going to be negative and we're just going to get negative 1.

38
00:02:55,593 --> 00:03:01,138
And so using this, we can actually try to graph our function.

39
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:02,336
So let's try to do that.

40
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:06,706
So let's say, that is my y axis,

41
00:03:06,706 --> 00:03:10,405
this is my x axis,

42
00:03:10,405 --> 00:03:13,955
and we see that we have 2 horizontal asymptotes.

43
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:17,957
We have 1 horizontal asymptote at y=1,

44
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,070
so let's say this right over here is y=1,

45
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,602
let me draw that line as dotted line,

46
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,405
we're going to approach this thing,

47
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,204
and then we have another horizontal asymptote at y=-1.

48
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:37,004
So that might be right over there, y=-1.

49
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:41,537
And if we want to plot at least 1 point we can think about what does f(0) equal.

50
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:50,289
So, f(0) is going to be equal to 0 over the square root of 0+1, or 0 squared plus 1.

51
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,540
Well that's all just going to be equal to zero.

52
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,540
So we have this point, right over here,

53
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,538
and we know that as x approaches infinity, we're approaching this blue, horizontal asymptote,

54
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:06,235
so it might look something like this.

55
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:12,669
Let me do it a little bit differently. There you go.

56
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,289
I'll clean this up. So it might look something like this.

57
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,337
That's not the color I wanted to use.

58
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:25,271
So it might look something like that.

59
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:29,592
We get closer and closer to that asymptote as x gets larger and larger

60
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:38,138
and then like this -- we get closer and closer to this asymptote as x approaches negative infinity.

61
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,802
I'm not drawing it so well.

62
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:44,206
So that right over there is y=f(x).

63
00:04:44,206 --> 00:04:48,470
And you can verify this by taking a calculator, trying to plot more points

64
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,739
or using some type of graphing calculator or something.

65
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:54,871
But anyway, I just wanted to tackle another situation we're approaching infinity and or negative infinity

66
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,404
and we're trying to determine the horizontal asymptotes.

67
00:04:57,404 --> 00:05:01,070
And remember, the key is just to say what terms dominate

68
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,956
as x approaches positive infinity or negative infinity.

69
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:10,469
To say, well, what is that function going to approach, and it's going to approach this horizontal asymptote

70
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:13,240
in the positive direction and this one in the negative.
