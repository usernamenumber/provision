1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,130
We're first exposed to the idea
of a slope of a line early on

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,280
in our algebra careers.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,600
But I figure it never hurts to review it a bit.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,450
So let me draw some axes.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,800
That is my y-axis.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,170
Maybe I should call
it my f of x-axis.

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,320
y is equal to f of x.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,380
Let me draw my x-axis, just
like that, that is my x-axis.

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,970
And let me draw a line, let
me draw a line like this.

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,770
And what we want to do is
remind ourselves, how do we

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,935
find the slope of that line?

12
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:42,260
And what we do is, we take
two points on the line,

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,030
so let's say we take
this point, right here.

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,070
Let's say that that is the
point x is equal to a.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,260
And then what would this be?

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,480
This would be the point f of
a, where the function is

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,440
going to be some line.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,493
We could write f of x is going
to be equal to mx + b.

19
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,200
We don't know what m and b are.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,410
But this is all a little bit of review.

21
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,050
So this is a.

22
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,880
And then the y-value is what
happens to the function when

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,890
you evaluated it at a, so
that's that point right there.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,950
And then we could take
another point on this line.

25
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,760
Let's say we take
point b, right there.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,110
And then this coordinate
up here is going to be

27
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,010
the point b, f of b.

28
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,290
Right?

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,980
Because this is just the
point when you evaluate

30
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,780
the function at b.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,360
You put b in here, you're going
to get that point right there.

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,270
So let me just draw a
little line right there.

33
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,630
So that is f of b, right there.

34
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,774
Actually, let me make it clear
that this coordinate right here

35
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:38,780
is the point a, f of a.

36
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,280
So how do we find the slope
between these 2 points, or more

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,760
generally, of this entire line?

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,890
Because a line has -- the slope
is consistent the

39
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,350
whole way through it.

40
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,060
And we know that once we
find the slope, that's

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,610
actually going to be
the value of this m.

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,420
That's all a review of your
algebra, but how do we do it?

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,890
Well, a couple of ways
to think about it.

44
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,130
Slope is equal to
rise over run.

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,050
You might have seen that when
you first learned algebra.

46
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,670
Or another way of writing
it, it's change in

47
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,570
y over change in x.

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,240
So let's figure out what the
change in y over the change

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,810
in x is for this
particular case.

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,230
So the change in y
is equal to what?

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,180
Well, let's just take, you can
take this guy as being the

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,990
first point, or that guy
as being the first point.

53
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,980
But since this guy has a
larger x and a larger y,

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,870
let's start with him.

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,960
So, the change in y between that
guy and that guy is this

56
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,070
distance, right here.

57
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,800
So let me draw a
little triangle.

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,210
That distance right
there is a change in y.

59
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,190
Or I could just transfer
it to the y-axis.

60
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,190
This is the change in y.

61
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,340
That is your change
in y, that distance.

62
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,980
So what is that distance?

63
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,030
It's f of b minus f of a.

64
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,880
So it equals f of
b minus f of a.

65
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,990
That is your change in y.

66
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,480
Now what is your change
in x The slope is change

67
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,010
in y over change in x.

68
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,760
So what our change in x?

69
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,770
What's this distance?

70
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,490
Remember, we're taking this
to be the first point,

71
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,370
so we took its y minus
the other point's y.

72
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,880
So to be consistent, we're
going to have to take this

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,660
point's x minus this point's x.

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,460
So this point's
x-coordinate is b.

75
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,130
So it's going to be b minus a.

76
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,580
And just like that, if you knew
the equation of this line, or

77
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,610
if you had the coordinates of
these 2 points, you would just

78
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,460
plug them in right here and
you would get your slope.

79
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,990
That's straightforward.

80
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,150
And that comes straight out
of your Algebra 1 class.

81
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,060
And let me just, just to make
sure it's concrete for you,

82
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:59,035
if this was the point 2, 3. And let's
say that this, up here, was the point 5, 7.

83
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,488
Then if we wanted to find the slope of

84
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:06,460
this line, we would do 7 minus
3. That would be our change in y.

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,370
This would be 7 and this
would be 3. And then we

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,181
do that over 5 minus 2.

87
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:18,460
Because this would be a 5, and
this would be a 2.

88
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,620
And so this would be your change in x.

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,690
5 minus 2.

90
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,830
So 7 minus 3 is 4; and 5
minus 2 is 3.

91
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,760
So your slope would be 4 over 3 (4/3).

92
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,010
Now let's see if we
can generalize this.

93
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,370
And this is what the new
concept that we're going

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,320
to be learning as we
delve into calculus.

95
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,970
Let's see if we can generalize
this somehow to a curve.

96
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,310
So let's say I have a curve.

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,340
We have to have a curve
before we can generalize

98
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,180
it to a curve.

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,900
Let me scroll down a little.

100
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,850
Well, actually, I want to
leave this up here, to show

101
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,820
you the similarity.

102
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,390
Let's say I have -- I'll keep
it pretty general right now.

103
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,290
Let's say I have a curve.

104
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,080
I'll make it a
familiar-looking curve.

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,390
Let's say it's the curve y is
equal to x squared, which

106
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,860
looks something like that.

107
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,010
And I want to find the slope.

108
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,280
Let's say I want to find
the slope at some point.

109
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
And actually, before even
talking about it, let's even

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,930
think about what it means to
find the slope of a curve.

111
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,450
Here, the slope was the same
the whole time, right?

112
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,028
But on a curve, your
slope is changing.

113
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:27,196
And just to get an intuition
for what that means --

114
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,240
What's the slope over here?

115
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,610
Your slope over here is the
slope of the tangent line.

116
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,150
The line just
barely touches it.

117
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,180
That's the slope over there.

118
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,760
It's a negative slope.

119
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,790
Then over here, your slope is
still negative, but it's a

120
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,360
little bit less negative.

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,250
It goes like that.

122
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,570
I don't know if I did
that, drew that.

123
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,660
Let me do it in a
different color.

124
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,790
Let me do it in purple.

125
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,320
So over here, your slope is
slightly less negative.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,590
It's a slightly less
downward-sloping line.

127
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,130
And then when you go over here,
at the 0 point, right here,

128
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,030
your slope is pretty much flat,
because the horizontal line, y

129
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,610
equals 0, is tangent
to this curve.

130
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,330
And then as you go to more
positive x-es, then your

131
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,660
slope starts increasing.

132
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,340
I'm trying to draw
a tangent line.

133
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,170
And here it's increasing even
more, it's increased even more.

134
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,240
So your slope is changing the
entire time, and this is kind

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,930
of the big change that happens
when you go from a

136
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,530
line to a curve.

137
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,450
A line, your slope is the
same the entire time.

138
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,600
You could take any two points
of a line, take the change in y

139
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,170
over the change in x, and you
get the slope for

140
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,620
the entire line.

141
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,980
But as you can see already,
it's going to be a little

142
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,290
bit more nuanced when
we do it for a curve.

143
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,570
Because it depends what
point we're talking about.

144
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,200
We can't just say, what is
the slope for this curve?

145
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,760
The slope is different at
every point along the curve.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,120
It changes.

147
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,500
If we go up here, it's
going to be even steeper.

148
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,450
It's going to look
something like that.

149
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,780
So let's try a bit
of an experiment.

150
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,870
And I know how this experiment
turns out, so it won't

151
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,450
be too much of a risk.

152
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,300
Let me draw better than that.

153
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:11,800
So that is my y-axis,
and that's my x-axis.

154
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,690
Let's call this, we can call
this y, or we can call

155
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,660
this the f of x axis.

156
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,890
Either way.

157
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,780
And let me draw my curve again.

158
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,740
And I'll just draw it in the
positive coordinate, like that.

159
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,890
That's my curve.

160
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:33,400
And what if I want to find
the slope right there?

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
What can I do?

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,010
Well, based on our definition
of a slope, we need 2 points

163
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,380
to find a slope, right?

164
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,905
Here, I don't know how to
find the slope with 1 point.

165
00:07:41,905 --> 00:07:49,210
So let's just call this
point right here,

166
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,240
that's going to be x.

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,500
We're going to be general.

168
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,120
This is going to
be our point x.

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,300
But to find our slope,
according to our traditional

170
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,140
algebra 1 definition of a
slope, we need 2 points.

171
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,100
So let's get another
point in here.

172
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,950
Let's just take a slightly
larger version of this x.

173
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,430
So let's say, let's say we have that point right there. 
Actually, let's do it even

174
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,590
further out, just because it's
going to get messy otherwise.

175
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,680
So let's say we have
this point right here.

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,750
And the difference -- it's
just h bigger than x.

177
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,565
Or actually, instead of saying
h bigger, let's just, well

178
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,120
let me just say h bigger.

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,630
So this is x + h.

180
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,910
That's what that point
is right there.

181
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,430
So what are going to be their
corresponding y-coordinates

182
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,820
on the curve?

183
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,030
Well, this is the curve
of y is equal to f of x.

184
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,910
So this point right here
is going to be f of our

185
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,590
particular x right here.

186
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,930
And maybe to show you that I'm
taking a particular x, maybe

187
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,305
I'll do a little 0 here.

188
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:48,400
This is x naught, this
is x naught plus h.

189
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,430
This is f of x naught.

190
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,870
And then what is this going
to be up here, this point up

191
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,140
here, that point up here?

192
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,430
Its y-coordinate is going to be
f of -- f of this x-coordinate,

193
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,630
which I shifted
over a little bit.

194
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,170
It's right there. f of this
x-coordinate, which is

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,950
f of x naught plus h.

196
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,310
That's its y-coordinate.

197
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,840
So what is a slope going to be
between these two points that

198
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,410
are relatively close
to each other?

199
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,810
Remember, this isn't
going to be the slope

200
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,070
just at this point.

201
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,950
This is the slope of the line
between these two points.

202
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,080
And if I were to actually draw
it out, it would actually be a

203
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,680
secant line between,
to the curve.

204
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,860
So it would intersect the curve
twice, once at this point,

205
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,450
once at this point.

206
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,180
You can't see it.

207
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,510
If I blew it up a little
bit, it would look

208
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,330
something like this.

209
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,787
This is our coordinate x naught
f of x naught, and up here

210
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:51,805
is our coordinate for this
point, which would be, the

211
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:56,080
x-coordinate would be x naught
plus h, and the y-coordinate

212
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,180
would be f of x naught plus h.

213
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,135
Just whatever this function is,
we're evaluating it at this

214
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,770
x-coordinate That's all it is.

215
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,380
So these are the 2 points.

216
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,740
So maybe a good start is to
just say, hey, what is the

217
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,090
slope of this secant line?

218
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,760
And just like we did in the
previous example, you find the

219
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:22,470
change in y, and you divide
that by your change in x.

220
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,220
Let me draw it here.

221
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,940
Your change in y would be that
right here, change in y, and

222
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,840
then your change in x would
be that right there.

223
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,040
So what is the slope going
to be of the secant line?

224
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,250
The slope is going to be equal
to, let's start with this

225
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,440
point up here, just because
it seems to be larger.

226
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,320
So we want a change in y. so
this value right here, this

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,230
y-value, is f of
x naught plus h.

228
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,740
I just evaluated
this guy up here.

229
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,630
Looks like a fancy term,
but all it means is, look.

230
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,970
The slightly larger x
evaluate its y-coordinate.

231
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,250
Where the curve is
at that value of x.

232
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,290
So that is going to be, so the
change in y is going to be

233
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,400
a f of x naught plus h.

234
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,880
That's just the
y-coordinate up here.

235
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,830
Minus this y-coordinate
over here.

236
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,600
So minus f of x naught.

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,500
So that equals our change in y.

238
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,543
And you want to divide
that by your change in x.

239
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:21,090
242
00:11:21,09 --> 00:11:21,8
So what is this?

240
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,340
This is the larger x-value.

241
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,030
We started with this
coordinate, so we start

242
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,460
with its x-coordinate.

243
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,450
So it's x naught plus
h, x naught plus h.

244
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,610
Minus this x-coordinate.

245
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,970
Well, we just picked
a general number.

246
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,330
It's x naught.

247
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,300
So that is over
your change in x.

248
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,990
Just like that.

249
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,510
So this is the slope
of the secant line.

250
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,670
We still haven't answered what
the slope is right at that

251
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,100
point, but maybe this
will help us get there.

252
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,250
If we simplify this, so let
me write it down like this.

253
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:57,630
The slope of the secant, let
me write that properly.

254
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,930
The slope of the secant line is
equal to the value of the

255
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,840
function at this point, f of x
naught plus h, minus the value

256
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,750
of the function here,
mine f of x naught.

257
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,370
So that just tells
us the change in y.

258
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,250
It's the exact same definition
of slope we've always used.

259
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,890
Over the change in x.

260
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,920
And we can simplify this.

261
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,980
We have x naught plus
h minus x naught.

262
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,450
So x naught minus x naught
cancel out, so you

263
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,700
have that over h.

264
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,530
So this is equal to our change
in y over change in x.

265
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,380
Fair enough.

266
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,500
But I started off saying, I
want to find the slope of

267
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,880
the line at that point, at
this point, right here.

268
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,860
This is the zoomed-out
version of it.

269
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,260
So what can I do?

270
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,830
Well, I defined second point
here as just the first

271
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,370
point plus some h.

272
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,300
And we have something in our
toolkit called a limit.

273
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,840
This h is just a
general number.

274
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,400
It could be 10, it could be 2,
it could be 0.02, it could be 1

275
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,050
times 10 to the negative 100.

276
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,690
It could be an arbitrarily
small number.

277
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,210
So what happens, what would
happen, at least theoretically,

278
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,620
if I were take the limit
as h approaches 0?

279
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,360
So, you know, first, maybe h is
this fairly large number over

280
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,710
here, and then if I take h a
little bit smaller, then I'd be

281
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,740
finding the slope of
this secant line.

282
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,300
If I took h to be even a little
bit smaller, I'd be finding the

283
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,790
slope of that secant line.

284
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,200
If h is a little bit
smaller, I'd be finding

285
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,390
the slope of that line.

286
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,430
So as h approaches 0, I'll be
getting closer and closer to

287
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,230
finding the slope of the line
right at my point in question.

288
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,720
Obviously, if h is a large
number, my secant line is going

289
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,110
to be way off from the slope at
exactly that point right there.

290
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,430
But if h is 0.0000001, if it's
an infinitesimally small

291
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,810
number, then I'm going
to get pretty close.

292
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,250
So what happens if I
take the limit as h

293
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,530
approaches zero of this?

294
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:00,220
So the limit as h approaches
0 of my secant slope.

295
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Of, let me switch to green.

296
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,560
f of x naught plus h minus f of
x naught, that was my change in

297
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,490
y, over h, which is
my change in x.

298
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,720
And now just to clarify
something, and sometimes you'll

299
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,810
see it in different calculus
books, sometimes instead of an

300
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,930
h, they'll write
a delta x here.

301
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,390
Where this second point would
have been defined as x naught

302
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,660
plus delta x, and then, this
would have simplified to just

303
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,685
delta x over there, and we'd
be taking the limit as

304
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:31,870
delta x approaches 0.

305
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,200
The exact same thing.

306
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,780
h, delta x, doesn't matter.

307
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,630
We're taking h as the
difference between one x point

308
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,710
and then the higher x point,
and then we're just going to

309
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,980
take the limit as that
approaches zero.

310
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,010
We could have called that
delta x just as easily.

311
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:52,050
But I'm going to call this
thing, which equals the slope

312
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,260
of the tangent line, and it
does equal the slope of the

313
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,720
tangent line, I'm going to call
this the derivative of f.

314
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,105
Let me write that down.

315
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:05,580
319
00:15:05,58 --> 00:15:10,65
And I'm going to say that this
is equal to f prime of x.

316
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,680
And this is going to
be another function.

317
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,320
Because remember, the slope
changes at every x-value.

318
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,640
No matter what x-value
you pick, the slope is

319
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,260
going to be different.

320
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,880
Doesn't have to be, but the
way I drew this curve,

321
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,500
it is different.

322
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,950
It can be different.

323
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,070
So now, you give me an x-value
in here, I'll apply this

324
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,090
formula over here, and
then I can tell you the

325
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,810
slope at that point.

326
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,180
And it all seems very
confusing and maybe

327
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,810
abstract at this point.

328
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,030
In the next video, I'll
actually do an example of

329
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,300
calculating a slope, and
it'll make it everything a

330
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,400
little bit more concrete.
