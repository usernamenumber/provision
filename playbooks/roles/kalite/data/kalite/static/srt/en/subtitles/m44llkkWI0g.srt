1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,190
Problem 100. They draw this graph,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:08,210
which I guess I should also draw. So they draw it pretty big.

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,030
So I'll draw it pretty big as well.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,420
They have a line that goes from the center to there,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,080
it's a pie graph. Then they call that category like that,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,530
and another category that looks something like that,

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,690
and then they have a final category

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,250
that looks something like that.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:37,540
They say that this is the highway trust fund,which is 72%.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,230
They say x% is a tire tax.

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,920
This is 12%,which is a gas tax.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,210
Then you have x plus 4%,which is a tax on trucks.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,780
According to the graph above,what percent of the funds for

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,880
highway maintenance-- oh,and this title says sources of funds

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,290
for highway maintenance. So that's what this whole thing is.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,060
According to the graph above,what percent of the funds for

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,080
highway maintenance came from the tax on tires?

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,120
So we need to solve for x. So let's think about it.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:26,860
x plus 12 plus x plus 4,that's this,plus 72 have to

20
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,850
equal 100%. We have two x's,get those out of the way,

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,560
and then what is this equal to? 12 plus 4 is 16.

22
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,580
16 plus 72-- let me write that down.

23
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,510
I always make careless mistakes. That's 16. 16 plus 72 is 88.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:56,980
2x plus 88 is equal to 100. Then you have 2x is equal to,

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,640
subtract 88 from both sides,12. x is equal to 6.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,110
That's exactly what we're looking for,the tire tax.

27
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,230
So that's 6%. That's choice B.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,800
Drawing it was harder than solving it. Problem 101.

29
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,880
A poll reveals that the average arithmetic mean income

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,540
of 10 households is $25,000.

31
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,890
So we could say,average of 10 is equal to 25K.

32
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,470
If 6 of the households have income of $30,000 each,

33
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,060
what is the average of the other 4 households?

34
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,620
So if we were to average all of them,we could say it would be

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,580
6 times the households that are 30,000,so 6 times 30K,

36
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,090
plus 4 times the average of the other 4.

37
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,550
So let's say that's what we're trying to solve for,

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,790
4 times the average of the other 4 households.

39
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,120
This would be the sum of all of the households.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,610
If we were to divide that by 10,we're going to get

41
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,070
the total average of all 10,which is 25.

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,760
Hopefully that makes sense. You have 6 households making 30K,

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,700
so the sum of those households is going to be 6 times 30.

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,660
Then the sum of the other 4 households is going to be 4

45
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,960
times their average.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,540
That's what they're asking us for,what is the average income?

47
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,600
If you take the sum of all the households,all 10,

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
you divide it by 10,you get their average.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
So you get 6 times 30-- I don't want to make this

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,610
look like a variable,that's 30,000.

51
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,740
We know we're dealing in thousands.

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,020
So 6 times 30 is 180 plus 4x is equal to 10 times 25,

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:48,560
is equal to 250. 4x is equal to,what's 250 minus 180?

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,970
That's 50,and you have another 20,it's equal to 70.

55
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,230
Then you have x is equal to,let's see,4 goes into 70,

56
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,570
1 30,goes into it 7,7 times 4 is 28.

57
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,270
Goes into 20 5 times,and the decimal.

58
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:12,070
So 17.5,and we're dealing with thousands,so $17,500.

59
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,070
That's choice C. Problem 102.

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:31,270
If T is equal to 5/9 times K minus 32,

61
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,080
and T is equal to 290,then what is K equal to?

62
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,160
This is kind of one of those speed problems.

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,500
So we have 290 is equal to 5/9 times K minus 32.

64
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,850
So multiply both sides by 9/5,you get 9/5 times 290

65
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,630
is equal to K minus 32. So what's 290 divided by 5?

66
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:07,090
5 goes into 29 5 times,25,40,58 times.

67
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,520
So it's 9 times 58 is equal to K minus 32.

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:26,390
58 times 9,8 times 9 is 72.5 times 9 is 45 plus 7 is 52. 522.

69
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,640
So 522 is equal to K minus 32.

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:42,860
So K is equal to 522 plus 32,which is equal to 554,

71
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,780
Which is choice D. After doing all that math,

72
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,390
I was afraid that I'd made a careless mistake.

73
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,490
But it's reassuring to see that 554 is one of the choices.

74
00:05:51,490 --> 00:06:00,170
Problem 103. The water from one outlet flowing

75
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,780
at a constant rate can fill a swimming pool in 9 hours.

76
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,810
So you could say 1 pool per 9 hours from 1 outlet.

77
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,460
The water from a second outlet flowing at a constant rate

78
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,130
can fill the same pool in 5 hours.

79
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,920
So 1 pool in 5 hours,that's the second one.

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,760
If both outlets are used at the same time,approximately

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,290
what is the number of hours required to fill the pool?

82
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,240
So essentially,we can just add their two rates.

83
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:42,040
This one does 1/9 pool per hour,plus 1/5 pool per hour.

84
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,560
I just rewrote those two. So what's 1/9 plus 1/5?

85
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,320
Let's find a common denominator.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,020
45 I think is the first common denominator.

87
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,840
1/9 is 5 over 45. 1/5 is 9 over 45.

88
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:04,270
So together,they fill 5 plus 9 is 14/45 pool per hour.

89
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,020
If you want to fill exactly 1 pool,

90
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,050
so it's just like production is equal to rate times time.

91
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,570
So now your production is,you want to fill 1 pool,

92
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,930
and you can fill it at 14 over 45 pools per hour,

93
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,830
what is the time?

94
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,400
Well the time is going to be equal to 1/1 pool divided by

95
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:39,740
14/45 pools per hour,which is equal to,45/14--

96
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,590
1 over a fraction is just the inverse of that fraction--

97
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:50,170
so 45/14 hours. How many times does 14 going into 45?

98
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:59,350
14 goes into 45,is it 3 times? 3 times 14 is 12,is 42.

99
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,560
Then you have another 30.

100
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,580
Well,I already see one of the choices,3 point something.

101
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,410
But 14 goes into 30 2 times. 2 times 14 is 28.

102
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,500
Let's see if one of our choices is already-- yes,

103
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,220
choice D is already close enough to what we did.

104
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,330
We don't have to do any more math. So we get 3.2 hours.

105
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,310
If we'd kept dividing,we'd get 3.21. That's choice D.

106
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,390
It's just a little confusing.

107
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,030
The important thing is to always get it in terms of rate.

108
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,900
Add the rate,and just remember distance is equal to

109
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,370
rate times time,or production is equal to rate times time.

110
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,110
Don't let all these fractions daunt you too much.

111
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,550
Next problem. I'm almost out of space. Problem 104.

112
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,310
Diana bought a stereo for $530,which was the retail price,

113
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,070
plus a 6% sales tax.So that is equal to 1.06 times the retail

114
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,260
6% percent more than the retail.

115
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,470
How much could she have saved if she had bought the stereo

116
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,970
at the same retail price in a neighboring state,

117
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,320
where she would have paid a sales tax of 5%?

118
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,260
So essentially we want to figure out

119
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,980
how much she would've saved.

120
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,050
So let's figure out what the retail price was.

121
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,410
So retail is equal to 530 divided by 1.06.

122
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:32,440
1.06 goes into 530,it's a decimal,add two 0's,

123
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,990
shift the decimal over to the right twice.

124
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:44,620
106 goes into it 5 times,right? 106 goes into 530 5 times.

125
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:57,910
5 times 106,it's 530. OK,so the math here was simple.

126
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,750
so you have two 0's. So the retail price is $500.

127
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,230
So she paid $30 in tax,fair enough.

128
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,690
If she went to the neighboring state and paid 5%,

129
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,860
how much would she have paid in taxes?

130
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,440
So times 0.05,5 times 5,well 5 times 500 is 2,500,

131
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,920
plus two decimals,so it's $25 in tax.

132
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,100
So in the neighboring state,she would've paid $25 in taxes.

133
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,140
She paid $30 in taxes. So she would have saved $5.

134
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,370
So the choice is D.

135
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,340
Let's just try to fit one more problem in here,

136
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,590
just so we finish this page.

137
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,550
They say,if a square mirror has a 20 inch diagonal,

138
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,710
what was the approximate perimeter of the mirror in inches?

139
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,440
Let's try to do that.

140
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,160
That's not what I want to do.

141
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,630
I have a square mirror,it has a diagonal.

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,730
That diagonal,they're telling us,is 20 inches.

143
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,500
It's a square,so all the sides are the same.

144
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,510
They want to know its perimeter.

145
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,910
So they want to know essentially what 4x is equal to

146
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,390
if we add up all the sides. So what is x?

147
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:25,600
Well we just use Pythagorean theorem. This is a right angle.

148
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,840
So we know that x squared plus x squared is equal to

149
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,390
20 squared,is equal to the hypotenuse squared,is equal to 400

150
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:40,030
2x squared is equal to 400. x squared is equal to 200.

151
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,070
x is equal to the square root of 200.

152
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,730
They want to know the perimeter.

153
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,160
Well,it's going to be 4 times that.

154
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,130
So the perimeter is going to be equal to 4 times

155
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,190
the square root of 200.

156
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,060
Now this becomes an approximation problem.

157
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,260
So let's think about that.

158
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:08,370
The square root of 200 is about 15. 15 times 15 is 225.

159
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,860
Yeah,I think 15 would be a pretty good approximation.

160
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,650
14 would also work. 14,when you square it,is 196.

161
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:27,000
14 times 14,4 times 14 is 56. Then you have 140.

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,380
So 14 is about as close as you're going to get to 200.

163
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,920
It's going to be someplace between 14 and 15.

164
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:43,610
So 14 times 4 is 40. So 4 times 4 is 16,it's 56.

165
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,270
So it's going to be something higher than 56.

166
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,900
If we pick 14,it's 56. If we pick 15,it's 60.

167
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,950
So someplace between 56 and 60 is going to be the perimeter

168
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,970
of that mirror. So it's one of the choices B,60.

169
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,020
So that's going to be the closest one. So I'd go with B.

170
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,060
I'll see you in the next video.
