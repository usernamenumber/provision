00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,940
Diya is looking to buy a plot of land to build her home on

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,746
She finally narrows her search to two plots that both have good locations.

3
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:17,471
The plot at 314159 Apple Lane has a width of 30 meters and a lenght of 40 meters.

4
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:26,202
The plot at 11235 Fibonacci Drive has a width of 50 meters and lenght of 20 meters.

5
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:30,132
They are each being sold for 36,000 dollars.

6
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:33,412
Which one is a better deal?

7
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:37,003
So they are the same price and they are in comparable neighbourhoods

8
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:42,339
So really the better deal is the one that actually gets me more area

9
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,669
So i encourage you to pause the video and think about

10
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:50,081
Which one of these am i getting more land for the same amount of money

11
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:53,576
Well to think about how much land im getting

12
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:56,601
im really thinking how much space is that plot taking up

13
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,779
or im really thinking up what is the area of each of these plots

14
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:08,875
And we have already figured out that you can calculate the area of a rectangle by multilplying its lenght times its width

15
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:20,081
So the area of Apple Lane is 40 meters times 30 meters which is equal to

16
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:26,803
40 times 3 is 120 .... 40 times 30 is 1200

17
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:34,166
and its meters times meters so you could view this as square meters

18
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,323
1200 square meters

19
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:41,813
Now lets think about what the area of the plotted Fibonacci drive is

20
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:45,735
So its lenght is 20, its width is 50

21
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:57,076
So here the area is 20 meters times 50 meters which is equal to

22
00:01:57,076 --> 00:02:07,412
20 times 5 is 100... 20 times 50 is 1000 square meters

23
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:11,550
So its pretty clear when you calculate the area that Apple Lane

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,407
you are getting more square meters than you would get at Fibonacci Drive

25
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:18,294
And literary when we say 1200 square meters that means

26
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:23,323
if you would have put a 1 meter by 1 meter square here

27
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:24,748
so really small like that

28
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:29,428
that you could fit 1200 of these on this plot of land

29
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,417
while you could only fit a 1000 of them on this plot of land

30
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,667
these 1 meter by 1 meter squares

31
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:40,271
So we have a larger area, same neighbourhood or comparable neighbourhood for the same price

32
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,191
I would go with Apple Lane being the better deal
