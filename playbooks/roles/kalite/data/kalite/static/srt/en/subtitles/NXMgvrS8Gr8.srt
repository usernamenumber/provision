1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,634
Let's talk a little bit about
what I find to be one of the

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:05,719
more mysterious forces
of the universe.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,439
Actually, I find all of the
forces of the universe to be

4
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,366
fairly mysterious,
so let's talk a

5
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:12,420
little bit about charge.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,674
And we've all heard of charge.

7
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,583
Charge the battery.

8
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,769
This particle has charge.

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,319
But when you really think about
it, all charge means is

10
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:25,406
that there's this property
called charge, and we know

11
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:31,167
that if something contains a
positive charge-- and calling

12
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,047
it positive is a little
bit arbitrary.

13
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:35,334
It's not like protons have a
little plus written on them.

14
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,551
We could have called
them negative.

15
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:38,469
But when something has a
positive charge and when

16
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:42,949
something else has a positive
charge, that

17
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,986
they repel each other.

18
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:48,033
We also know that if I had
something else, another

19
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:51,236
particle that happened to have
a negative charge, and once

20
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:53,737
again, the word "negative"
being applied to this is

21
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:54,981
completely arbitrary.

22
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:58,538
They could have called it blue
charge and red charge, but all

23
00:00:58,538 --> 00:01:01,954
we know is that when another
object has the other charge--

24
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:03,456
in this case, we call it
negative-- that's going to be

25
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:06,505
attracted to a positive
charge.

26
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:07,970
So what do we know
about charge?

27
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,070
Charge is a property that
particles have, and if you put

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,154
enough particles together,
I guess objects have that

29
00:01:13,154 --> 00:01:14,869
property as well.

30
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,157
So it's just a property.

31
00:01:17,157 --> 00:01:19,773
And that's a way of saying
that I really don't

32
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:21,034
know what it is.

33
00:01:21,034 --> 00:01:22,571
And frankly, no one
fundamentally

34
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:23,589
knows what it is.

35
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:26,399
Actually, no one really
fundamentally knows anything.

36
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,218
But charge is a property
of particles and

37
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,206
objects, just like mass.

38
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:33,002
I mean, if you think about it,
mass is just a property.

39
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,487
And to some degree, it seems
a little bit more real than

40
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:40,068
charge, because our brains
are wired to in some way

41
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:44,135
comprehend what mass is, but
we're probably comprehending

42
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:47,469
weight and volume more than
mass, but we can think more

43
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,993
about that at another time.

44
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:51,991
Charge is a little bit more
abstract because, before we

45
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,236
started rubbing amber into our
hair, we really didn't

46
00:01:56,236 --> 00:02:00,214
experience much charge unless
we got struck by lightning.

47
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:03,529
So charge is a property that
particles or objects have, and

48
00:02:03,529 --> 00:02:06,428
we know that there are two types
of charge, which we've

49
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:12,129
arbitrarily named positive
and negative.

50
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:26,522
And we know that like charges
repel and opposite charges

51
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:31,553
attract, or unlike charges
attract, right?

52
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,642
So what can we do with this?

53
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:36,005
Well, if we have this property,
I think a useful

54
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:40,562
thing to do would be to measure
the property, and so

55
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:44,669
we came up with units, and so
the unit of charge is called

56
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,752
the coulomb.

57
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:50,064
It's named after a scientist in
the late 1700s, who played

58
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,868
around a lot with charge.

59
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,773
You could look up more about
him on Wikipedia.

60
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,902
But it's called the coulomb,
and the coulomb-- there's a

61
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:01,687
bunch of definitions, but I like
to think of it in terms

62
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:05,550
of elementary particles, just
because, to some degree,

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,282
unless you go into quantum
theory and start talking about

64
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:11,462
quarks and stuff, the elementary
charge is the

65
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:14,062
charge on a proton
or a neutron.

66
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:17,134
So I'll go into more detail in
the future on actually the

67
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:19,118
structure of atoms and whatever
else, but let me just

68
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:20,695
draw a little example.

69
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:25,148
So an atom tends to have some
neutrons in them, which don't

70
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:27,692
have this charge property.

71
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:31,000
It'll have some protons
in them, which

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,875
have a positive charge.

73
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,349
Once again, that's kind of

74
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,185
arbitrarily defined as positive.

75
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,881
We could have called
a red charge.

76
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:42,230
And then it has these things
floating around that are much,

77
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,215
much, much lighter than the
protons and the neutrons in

78
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:50,978
the nucleus, and these
are called electrons.

79
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:54,275
It's not even clear that
they're real objects.

80
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:59,021
They're almost like energy, but
sometimes it's useful to

81
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,117
view them as objects.

82
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,915
Sometimes it's useful
to view them as--

83
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:04,164
well, not as objects.

84
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:06,898
And we'll go into all of that
more later, but electrons have

85
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,613
a negative charge.

86
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:11,411
And the fundamental unit of
charge, as far as we are

87
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,649
concerned right now before we
start talking about quarks and

88
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:17,893
other potentially subatomic
particles, is the charge in an

89
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:19,148
electron or proton.

90
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,882
And they have the exact same
charge, and that elementary

91
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:23,925
charge is denoted by e.

92
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,659
And to be frank, I'm not sure
whether e stands for

93
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,230
elementary or e stands
for electron.

94
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,527
But actually, e is equal to the
charge of a proton so it

95
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:38,738
probably stands for elementary
charge of a proton.

96
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,743
And the charge of an electron
is the negative of this, so

97
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:50,814
negative e is the charge
of an electron.

98
00:04:51,314 --> 00:04:55,810
But if we didn't care
about sign, then the

99
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,299
magnitudes are the same.

100
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:00,927
So that's the fundamental as
far as we know or so far in

101
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:01,868
our physics.

102
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,697
That's the fundamental charge.

103
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:06,760
The fundamental unit of charge
is just the charge in a proton

104
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,694
or neutron.

105
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,449
So how does a coulomb
relate to that?

106
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,733
Well, a coulomb, which we'll
denote by C, is equal to-- and

107
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,226
this is a bit of an arbitrary
number, but when we start

108
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:20,226
doing things with electricity,
we'll see why the coulomb was

109
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:26,226
defined the way it is, but a
coulomb is 6.24 times 10 to

110
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:30,400
the eighteenth e's.

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,925
Or you can say it's 6.24 times
10 to the eighteenth times the

112
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,998
charge on an electron--
actually, times the charge on

113
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:40,443
a proton, and then, of course,
in terms of magnitude.

114
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,699
Because if I just say
coulomb, I'm not

115
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:43,995
really giving a direction.

116
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,852
So if you look at it the other
way around, you can say that

117
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:50,728
the elementary charge is equal
to-- at least its magnitude--

118
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:56,194
1.6 times 10 to the
minus 19 coulombs.

119
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,954
So fair enough.

120
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,671
This might be a useful number
to memorize, but it will

121
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,776
usually be provided for
you in some way.

122
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,975
So what can we do?

123
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,725
We say that these objects have
this property called charge.

124
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,308
Like charges repel.

125
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:11,441
Unlike charges attract.

126
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:16,689
If we have enough of these
protons together, then the

127
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,243
whole object has charge.

128
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:22,028
If we have more protons than
electrons, then we have a

129
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:22,838
positive charge.

130
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,025
If we have more electrons
than protons, we

131
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,441
have a negative charge.

132
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:29,005
And we know that we've defined
this unit of charge called the

133
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:32,524
coulomb, which is a bunch of
the fundamental charge.

134
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,824
So let's play around with
this and see if

135
00:06:33,824 --> 00:06:35,726
we can measure charge.

136
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,570
So part of the initial-- I
guess we could call it--

137
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,145
definition on what charge is,
I said that like charges

138
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,994
repel, right?

139
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,454
Like charges repel so both
of these are positive.

140
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,782
They're going to repel
each other.

141
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:57,095
And unlike charges, if this is
negative, this is positive,

142
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,352
they're going to attract
each other, right?

143
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,700
So by definition, if they are
moving each other, these two

144
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,201
particles are going
to accelerate

145
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,317
away from each other.

146
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:07,515
These two particles are
going to accelerate

147
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,017
towards each other.

148
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,697
The charge between these
particles or the charge in

149
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,948
each of these particles must
be generating some type of

150
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:15,919
force, right?

151
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,098
If there was no force being
generated, then they wouldn't

152
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:21,081
repel or attract each other,
and this is where we get to

153
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,279
Coulomb's Law, and this
is why we named

154
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,398
charges after Coulomb.

155
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:31,866
Coulomb figured out that the
force between two charges is

156
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,600
equal to-- and this is going to
be a vector quantity, and

157
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,601
in about 30 seconds, I'll tell
you what happens with the

158
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,946
direction-- is equal to some
constant times the first

159
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:48,243
charge times the second charge
divided by the distance

160
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,368
between them squared.

161
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:52,601
And this is pretty neat because
this looks an awful

162
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:57,566
lot like-- so if we call this
the force, the electric force,

163
00:07:57,566 --> 00:08:00,980
that looks a lot like the
gravitational force equation.

164
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,416
Let me write that down.

165
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,934
The force from gravity between
two masses is equal to the

166
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:13,366
gravitational constant times
m1 times m2 divided by the

167
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,817
distance between them squared.

168
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:18,285
So far, the two forces that
we've covered, gravity, and

169
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,329
now we're covering electric
force and we'll eventually

170
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:24,716
expand this to electromagnetic
force, it seems like they kind

171
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,284
of act at distance in a similar
way, and both of these

172
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,979
forces apply in a vacuum.

173
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,883
So it doesn't matter if you have
no air, if you have no

174
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:35,917
substances between the two
particles, somehow they are

175
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,986
communicating with each
other, which I find

176
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:39,401
kind of amazing, right?

177
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:41,462
You can have nothing between
these two particles, but

178
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:44,328
somehow, this particle knows
that that particle's there and

179
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,584
that particle knows that that
particle's there, and they

180
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,764
start moving without having
any-- it's not like they have

181
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:51,951
a wire connected to each other
and someone's telling the

182
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,735
other particle, hey, there's
a particle there.

183
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:54,732
Start moving.

184
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,399
So I don't know if you find that
as amazing as I do, but

185
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,550
think about it and you might.

186
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,794
And it's just like gravity.

187
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:00,402
I mean, the two masses are
in no way connected.

188
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:02,579
They could be sitting in a
vacuum, but somehow, they know

189
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,162
that the other particle's
there.

190
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:07,187
And when we start learning about
special relativity and

191
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:10,603
all of that, we'll learn that
there's nothing there, but

192
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:13,201
maybe the masses are actually
somehow shaping the universe.

193
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,963
And maybe that's happening
with the

194
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:17,135
electric charges as well.

195
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:20,117
But all we know at this point is
that we have these charges

196
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:23,931
and that they exert a force on
each other that's proportional

197
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:27,528
to the product of their
respective charges divided by

198
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,968
the square of the distance
between them.

199
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:36,301
And this constant right here,
that is-- I always forget it.

200
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,603
What was it?

201
00:09:37,603 --> 00:09:42,520
I think it's 6.-- I always
forget what that constant is.

202
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,351
It is 9 times 10 to the ninth.

203
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,966
It's rounded, of course.

204
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:51,653
That would be amazing
if it was exactly 9.

205
00:09:51,653 --> 00:10:00,131
9 times 10 to the ninth, and
the units are newton-meter

206
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,629
squared per coulomb squared.

207
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,979
And why are those the units?

208
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:10,859
Well, pretty much because at
the end, we have coulomb,

209
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:13,163
coulomb, so we're going to have
coulomb squared divided

210
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:16,458
by meter squared, and we want to
finish with newtons, so we

211
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,862
want to cancel out the coulomb
squared by putting it in the

212
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:19,535
denominator.

213
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,127
We want to cancel out the meter
squared by putting it in

214
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,859
the numerator, and then we'll
end up with the newtons to get

215
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,139
the force, so that's just where
the units come from.

216
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,228
So given that, let's
figure out the

217
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,113
force between two particles.

218
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:35,899
So let's say I have-- and I've
spent 10 minutes with a pretty

219
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,429
long-winded explanation, but the
actual problems you'll see

220
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,098
in your physics class are pretty
straightforward when it

221
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,331
comes to Coulomb's Law.

222
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:48,432
So they'll say, hey, we have a
positive-- we have a particle

223
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:56,069
here that has a positive charge
of plus-- let me think

224
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:05,269
of a good number-- plus 5
times 10 to the minus 3

225
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,226
coulombs, so that's
a positive charge.

226
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,730
And then we have a negative
charge here, so let's say

227
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,375
that-- I don't know.

228
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,424
How far will I make them?

229
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,371
Let's say that they're half a
meter apart, 0.5 meters apart,

230
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:24,828
and then I have a negative
charge here that is 10 minus

231
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:32,911
10 times 10 to the
minus 2 coulombs.

232
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:35,177
So what is the force between
these two particles?

233
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,762
So if we just plug them in to
Coulomb's Law, we get the

234
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:42,017
force due to the electricity.

235
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,355
The electrical force.

236
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:45,342
Not due to electricity.

237
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:46,693
We haven't done that yet.

238
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:49,100
The static electric force
between those two particles is

239
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:56,205
equal to the constant 9 times
10 to the ninth times the

240
00:11:56,205 --> 00:12:01,852
first charge times 5 times 10
to the minus 3 times the

241
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:04,757
second charge-- let me do that
in a different color-- times

242
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:10,610
minus 10 times 10 to the minus
2-- I just rewrote that,

243
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,125
although you probably can't
see it-- divided by the

244
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,408
distance squared,
so 0.5 squared.

245
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,374
We just plugged into
this formula.

246
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,837
So that equals-- let me see.

247
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:21,272
So 9 times 0.5 times 10.

248
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:23,584
I'm just going to do
the 10 separately.

249
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:25,207
So that's times minus 10.

250
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:31,840
This is 0.5 times minus 10 is
minus 5 times 9 is minus 45,

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,826
and then 10 to the ninth minus
3, so 10 to the sixth, and

252
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:41,978
then minus 2, so 10 to the
fourth-- times 10 to the

253
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:46,559
fourth-- divided by-- and
what's 0.5 squared?

254
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,511
It's 0.25, right?

255
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,392
And this is equal to what?

256
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,562
That's equal to 4 times this
top, 160, plus this is equal

257
00:12:53,562 --> 00:13:05,004
to minus 180 times 10 to
the fourth newtons.

258
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,474
And actually, this might seem
like a large number, but these

259
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:10,592
charges that I put here are
actually fairly large charges,

260
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,459
and hopefully you'll get a sense
for what's a big or a

261
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,614
small charge later.

262
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,463
But these are reasonably large
charges, and so that's why

263
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,411
there's a relatively large force
exerting between these

264
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:22,354
two particles.

265
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,557
Now, we got a negative number,
so what does that mean?

266
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:28,073
Well, we know that unlike
particles attract, right?

267
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,760
Almost by definition.

268
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,194
In this case, we had a positive
and a negative, so

269
00:13:32,194 --> 00:13:36,790
when we end up with a negative
force when we use Coulomb's

270
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,592
Law, that means that the force
will draw the two particles to

271
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:44,477
each other along the shortest
distance between them.

272
00:13:44,477 --> 00:13:46,175
I mean, it's not going to
make them go in a curve.

273
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,619
That kind of makes sense.

274
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,313
If we had a positive there, that
means that the force was

275
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,160
repelling the two particles.

276
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,843
And if you ever get confused,
just think about it.

277
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,839
If they're both negative,
they're going to repel.

278
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,057
If they're both positive,
they're going to attract.

279
00:13:58,057 --> 00:14:01,100
I will see you in
the next video.
