1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:06,573
Let's think about the market for plastic bags

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,018
and I'm picking this market in particular

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,220
because there might be some costs

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,756
associated with plastic bags

5
00:00:12,756 --> 00:00:13,950
that aren't captured

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,913
when youâ€˜re only looking at it

7
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:19,042
from the point of view of the suppliers or the consumers

8
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:21,104
so right over here you have a demand curve

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:21,959
that's really the demand

10
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:23,786
coming from the supermarkets

11
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,081
so this is the demand curve

12
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,718
you could also view it as marginal benefit

13
00:00:27,718 --> 00:00:30,778
So that very first bag that gets produced

14
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,871
the supermarket gets a lot of marginal benefit

15
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,614
they really wanna get that bag

16
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:36,246
because then they can give it to the people

17
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:37,546
who that shop at the supermarket

18
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,206
and they can carry their bags home

19
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,082
But then each equivalent bag after that

20
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,353
the marginal benefit get lower and lower and lower

21
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:44,966
And this green curve over here

22
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,670
we've seen this multiple times

23
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,060
that is our supply curve

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,455
which we can also think of it

25
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,762
as our marginal cost curve

26
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,403
to produce that very first bag

27
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:55,992
The opportunity cost for that very first bag

28
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:57,971
looks like about a penny per bag

29
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,411
and then it gets higher and higher and higher

30
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,354
to produce more and more bags

31
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:03,004
And we have an equilibrium price

32
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,723
and an equilibrium quantity

33
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,172
our equilibrium quantity looks like it's about

34
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:08,056
3 and a half million bags

35
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,961
We have an equilibrium price

36
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,090
of about 2 cents per bag

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,330
if this were all of the costs

38
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,684
and all of the benefits

39
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,269
then this area, right over here

40
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,735
would show the aggregate total benefit

41
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,396
that the ecosystem here

42
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,734
the suppliers and the consumers

43
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,730
or the supermarkets or their consumers in this case

44
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,232
are getting from this transaction

45
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:36,009
marginal benefit higher the marginal costs

46
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,570
This whole area is our total surplus

47
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,776
we've seen that multiple times

48
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:43,394
But now let's think about that added costs

49
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,610
that plastic bags have

50
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,012
that are not factored into the costs and the prices

51
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:50,438
or the costs and the benefits right over here

52
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:58,083
Plastic bags have a negative externality!

53
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,119
There is a cost associated

54
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,372
So this is negative

55
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,978
because there is a cost associated with plastic bags

56
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:05,701
that is not being borne by

57
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,293
either, in this situation

58
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,518
that is not being factored

59
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,268
into the marginal cost curve

60
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:12,077
you can also have positive externality

61
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:12,906
which are the benefits

62
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:14,844
Maybe we'll be talking about the market for trees

63
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,041
and the society benefits

64
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,341
when more plants or more trees

65
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,906
are being planted or whatever

66
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,057
and let's just say that negative externality

67
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,332
that's coming from obvious things, you know

68
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:24,655
these bags are going to littered

69
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:25,937
they're going to be on the side of the highway

70
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,125
the city has to clean them up

71
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,414
there is an environmental risks due to them

72
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:32,577
animals might eat them and choke on them

73
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:34,772
and turtles might drown, you know whatever else

74
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,055
because they're choking on plastic bags and whatever else

75
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,718
and so they hire some experts

76
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,341
this is not an easy thing to do

77
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,944
But it's determined that

78
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:44,391
the negative externality of these plastic bags

79
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:46,669
is 2 cents per bag

80
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:47,734
Another way to think of it

81
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,880
the cost to to society and the environment

82
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,324
above and beyond the marginal cost to the producers

83
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,632
is 2 cents per bag

84
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:56,575
Now, given that

85
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,888
if we assume this statement right over here

86
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:01,215
It's not an easy thing to come up with this number

87
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,408
but if we assumed that this number is true

88
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:07,092
What then, is the optimal amount of bags to purchase

89
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,036
And what are we actually doing if we

90
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:10,997
or what is the optimal amount of bags to produce

91
00:03:10,997 --> 00:03:12,063
and what are we doing

92
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:13,840
when we do produce this much?

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,134
And to think about that

94
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,301
let's create a new curve

95
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,329
this is the supplier's marginal cost

96
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,379
Let's create another curve

97
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,654
that is the supplier plus the society's marginal cost

98
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:24,323
So that first bag, the supplier

99
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,151
opportunity cost is about a penny

100
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:28,724
but for society its costing another 2 cents

101
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,370
So, supplier plus society

102
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,254
is costing almost 3 cents

103
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,967
So, we can plot another curve

104
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,594
which we can view as

105
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:46,798
the supplier plus society marginal cost

106
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:48,866
So, now we can think of things

107
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:51,770
in terms of total benefit or total net benefit

108
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,060
I guess that's happening

109
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,446
That very first bag

110
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,064
the supermarket that buys it

111
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:58,731
is getting that over 5 cents of benefit

112
00:03:58,731 --> 00:03:59,854
but now if you think about

113
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,472
the net benefit to society

114
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:03,234
it's not this whole height

115
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,450
all the way down to a penny

116
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,730
it's only this part right over here

117
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,218
it's only the difference between 5 and 3

118
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:11,930
is the marginal net benefit

119
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,317
If you take the marginal benefit

120
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,741
and you subtract out of the total marginal costs

121
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,732
including the externalities

122
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:19,277
so the next bag

123
00:04:19,277 --> 00:04:20,826
the total cost gets a little higher

124
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,781
and the marginal benefit gets a little bit lower

125
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,779
And you keep

126
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,300
it makes sense for society

127
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,850
will keep getting benefit from this

128
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,541
if you think of the entire ecosystem

129
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,972
will keep getting benefit

130
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:34,821
until we hit this other equilibrium point over here

131
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,741
And once we get past this equilibrium point

132
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,057
now we think holistically

133
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,465
when we think of the environment

134
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:42,090
and the government and all of that

135
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,097
Now, all of a sudden

136
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,586
the marginal cost of each incremental unit

137
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,472
is higher than the marginal benefit

138
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,371
So, if we were to produce beyond that

139
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:52,457
Now we're incurring costs

140
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,983
now we're essentially eating out

141
00:04:53,983 --> 00:04:55,059
all of the benefit

142
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,080
that we would have gotten

143
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,455
if we were to produce all the way

144
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:59,875
to our old equilibrium point over here

145
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,333
way more in the way of this area

146
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,206
the purple area is more than the yellow area

147
00:05:05,206 --> 00:05:08,293
We're now getting a negative total benefit to society

148
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:11,112
or you could say a negative total surplus

149
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:13,580
and we haven't visualized it this way in the past

150
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,512
It's unusual for us

151
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,702
to see a dead weight loss

152
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:18,736
on this side of the equilibrium point

153
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,682
but you could also view it that way

154
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:21,711
So, this right over here

155
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:27,944
is negative surplus

156
00:05:27,944 --> 00:05:30,197
So what you really want holistically

157
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:34,012
if you are the benevolent emperor of the society

158
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,316
and you really wanna factor in

159
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:38,620
all of the costs and the benefits of the plastic bags

160
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,638
the ideal thing

161
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:42,245
if you wanna optimize the benefits for society

162
00:05:42,245 --> 00:05:44,612
you would want the equilibrium price to be around here

163
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,178
that looks like about 3.50

164
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:50,260
and the equilibrium quantity

165
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,682
would be around 1.8 million

166
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:55,180
and you would not want all of this excess quantity

167
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,742
that is taking away

168
00:05:56,742 --> 99:59:59,999
that is less efficient for society
