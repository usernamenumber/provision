1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,120
We are in the home stretch.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,150
Problem number 17 on page 463.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,390
Oh, I like these with these
strange operations.

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:18,190
Let the operation up arrow be
defined as a up arrow b is

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:26,780
equal to a plus b over a minus
b, for all numbers in a and b,

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,230
where a does not equal b.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,190
And why do they to
have to say that?

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,250
Well, because otherwise, our
denominator would be 0.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,890
   

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:45,180
So we know that 1 up 2 is equal
to 2 up x, what is x?

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,750
   

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,920
So let's set up the equation.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,640
So what is 1 up arrow 2?

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,140
So that's 1 plus 2
over 1 minus 2.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,960
So it's 1 plus 2
over 1 minus 2.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,230
I just used this formula,
1 is a, 2 is be, right?

18
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,750
What's 2 up arrow x?

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,560
That's 2 plus x over
2 minus x.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,810
   

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,900
So 1 plus 2 is 3.

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,340
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,530
So it's negative 1 is equal to
2 plus x over 2 minus x, and

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,020
of course this is just
equal to negative 3.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,540
And now we can multiply both
sides of this equation by 2

26
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,560
minus x, because we know that x
can't be equal to 2, because

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,330
it says a can't be equal to b.

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,820
So we know we're not multiplying
both sides of this

29
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,590
equation by 0.

30
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,180
2 minus x.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,730
That's all I'm doing, I'm
just multiplying both

32
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,440
sides by 2 minus x.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,200
   

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,700
On the left-hand side, I
get negative 3 minus 3,

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,130
times 2 minus x.

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,870
And on the right-hand side, the
2 minus x's cancel out,

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,560
and I get 2 plus x.

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,390
And then I distribute the 3.

39
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:11,009
Minus 6 plus 3x is equal
to 2 plus x.

40
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,310
And let's see, where
do I want my x's?

41
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,150
Let's add 6 to both sides.

42
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,360
3x is equal to 8 plus x.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,070
Subtract x from both sides.

44
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,950
2x is equal to 8.

45
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,540
x is equal to 4.

46
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,590
Choice A.

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,050
OK, problem number 18.

48
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,530
I'm going to switch colors, too,
because this color is not

49
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,710
appealing to me.

50
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,830
Let's see, green.

51
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,880
18, looks like this involves
money, so green is good.

52
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,050
During a sale, a customer can
buy one shirt for x dollars.

53
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,330
So 1 for x.

54
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,990
   

55
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,120
Each additional shirt
costs z dollars less

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,480
than the first shirt.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,650
soon.

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:11,130
So additional z less than first.
For example, the cost

59
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,990
of the second shirt
is x minus z.

60
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,570
All right, fair enough.

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,030
Which of the following
represents the customer's cost

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,910
in dollars for n shirts bought
during the sale?

63
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,340
   

64
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,280
So the first shirt is
going to cost x.

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,475
The first shirt's
going to cost x.

66
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:35,860
And then how many
shirts are left?

67
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,390
Well, there's n minus 1 shirts,
that aren't the first

68
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,880
shirt, right?

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,360
They buy 1 shirt at x and then
they're going to buy n minus 1

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,230
at the other price.

71
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,710
And then the other price
is x minus z.

72
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,990
Because it's not like the third
shirt costs z less than

73
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,925
the second, and then the fourth
shirt costs z less

74
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:02,110
than-- they all cost z less
than the first, right?

75
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,910
So every other shirt
costs x minus z.

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,960
So we have n minus
1 other shirts.

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,210
The first one costs x, then we
have n minus 1 shirts that

78
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,140
cost x minus z dollars.

79
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,410
And did they draw it
right like that?

80
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,320
Yes, that is choice A.

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,220
I thought maybe they might have
multiplied it out and

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,300
we'd have to look for something
similar, but they

83
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,160
give it just the way it is.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,070
All right, next problem.

85
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:43,060
Problem number 19.

86
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,510
I don't need to draw
it neatly.

87
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,110
I can draw this thing
freehand.

88
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,360
   

89
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,070
OK, so this is P, 30
degrees, Q, and R.

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,960
In the figure above, QR is the
arc of a circle with center P.

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:12,870
If the length of QR is 6 pi,
what is the area of sector P?

92
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,440
So this length is 6 pi,
so they want to know

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,220
what this area is.

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,870
Well, the important realization
is is that this is

95
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,440
part of a larger circle.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,940
So if I were to draw the entire
circle like that, and

97
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,290
then I would draw-- let me do
it in a different color.

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:43,750
This is part of a larger circle,
where this is P, Q, R,

99
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,100
and 30 degrees.

100
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,830
And this 30 degrees is important
because it tells us

101
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,180
what fraction of the larger
circle this is.

102
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,440
Well, how many degrees are there
in a total circle? you

103
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,570
Well there are 360, right?

104
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,330
If we were to go all the way
around, there's 360.

105
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,990
So the fraction that this is
of the full circle is 30

106
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,400
degrees over 360.

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,550
And this is 1/12.

108
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,540
I haven't drawn it to scale.

109
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,760
The way I drew it, it looks more
like 60 degrees, but you

110
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,970
should be able draw 12 pies
of 30 degrees here.

111
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,110
I hope I'm not confusing you,
because there are 360 degrees

112
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,170
in the circle.

113
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,520
So if this slice is 1/12 of the
whole circle, then this

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,980
arc length, this 6 pi right
here, is going to be 1/12 of

115
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,540
the entire circumference.

116
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,830
So what's the circumference?

117
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,340
The circumference is going
to be 12 times this.

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,160
So the circumference
is 12 times 6 pi,

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,950
which equals 72 pi.

120
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,520
If the circumference is 72
pi, what is the radius?

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,770
What's the formula?

122
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,200
Circumference is equal
to 2 pi r.

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,290
So we could say that also
is equal to 72 pi.

124
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,810
So you could divide both sides
by pi, and then divide both

125
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,450
sides by 2.

126
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,490
And you have the radius
is equal to 36.

127
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,170
So this radius right here-- let
me do it in a different

128
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,260
color-- this radius
is equal to 36.

129
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,220
All I did is I figured out this
arc length is 1/12 of the

130
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,940
entire circumference.

131
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,610
And so the entire circumference
is 72 pi.

132
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,260
And then I used that to
figure out that the

133
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,000
radius must be 36.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,390
Now we want to know the area
of just this piece.

135
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,310
So we could just figure out the
area of the whole thing

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,980
and then divide by 12, because
this is 1/12 the area of the

137
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,260
circle as well.

138
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,720
So what's the area?

139
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,580
Area is equal to pi r squared.

140
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,050
That equals pi times 36
squared-- I'm going to write

141
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,220
36 times 36.

142
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,320
I don't want multiply
big numbers.

143
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,230
And then that's the area of the
whole thing, is pi times

144
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,190
36, times 36.

145
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,820
So the area of just this
fraction will be the area of

146
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,880
the whole thing divided by 12.

147
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,760
And the reason why I didn't
multiply it out is because I

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,580
can actually cancel.

149
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,600
I can say, well, this
is 3, this is 1.

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,330
So it's pi times 3, times 36.

151
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,570
And what's 3 times 36?

152
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,940
90 plus 18 is 108, so
it equals 108 pi,

153
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,539
which is choice A.

154
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,850
Let's see if I can squeeze
in the last problem.

155
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,799
Probably not.

156
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,890
Actually, I will save the last
problem for a video of its

157
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,640
own, because I only have
