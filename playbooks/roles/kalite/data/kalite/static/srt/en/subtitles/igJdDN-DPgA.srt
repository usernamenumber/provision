1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,840
In this video I will prove
to you that the limit as

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:15,290
x approaches 0 of sine of
x over x is equal to 1.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,530
But before I do that, before I
break into trigonometry, I'm

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,650
going to go over another
aspect of limits.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,140
And that's the squeeze theorem.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,200
Because once you understand
what the squeeze theorem is,

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,150
we can use the squeeze
theorem to prove this.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,510
It's actually a pretty involved
explanation, but I think you'll

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,160
find it pretty neat and
satisfying if you get it.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,220
If you don't get it, maybe you
just want to memorize this.

12
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,580
Because that's a very useful
limit to know later on when

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,680
we take the derivatives
of trig functions.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,240
So what's the squeeze theorem?

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,040
The squeeze theorem is
my favorite theorem in

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,790
mathematics, possibly because
it has the word squeeze in it.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,560
Squeeze theorem.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,310
And when you read it in a
calculus book it looks

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,740
all complicated.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,580
I don't know when you read
it, in a calculus book or

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,500
in a precalculus book.

22
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,080
It looks all complicated,
but what it's saying is

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,440
frankly pretty obvious.

24
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,410
Let me give you an example.

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:16,710
If I told you that I
always-- so Sal always

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,150
eats more than Umama.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,650
Umama is my wife.

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,670
If I told you that this
is true, Sal always

29
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,370
eats more than Umama.

30
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:42,990
And I were also to say that Sal
always eats less than-- I don't

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,190
know, let me make up a
fictional character--

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,835
than Bill.

33
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,370
   

34
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,020
So on any given day-- let's
say this is in a given day.

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,120
Sal always eats more than Umama
in any given day, and Sal

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,600
always eats less than
Bill on any given day.

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:15,360
Now if I were tell you that on
Tuesday Umama ate 300 calories

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,840
and on Tuesday Bill
ate 300 calories.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,390
   

40
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,820
So my question to you is, how
many calories did Sal eat,

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,150
or did I eat, on Tuesday?

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,380
Well I always eat more than
Umama-- well, more than or

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,300
equal to Umama-- and I always
eat less than or equal to Bill.

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,350
So then on Tuesday, I must
have eaten 300 calories.

45
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,950
So this is the gist of the
squeeze theorem, and I'll do

46
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,940
a little bit more formally.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,710
But it's essentially saying, if
I'm always greater than one

48
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,190
thing and I'm always less than
another thing and at some point

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,560
those two things are equal,
well then I must be equal

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
to whatever those two
things are equal to.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,080
I've kind of been squeezed
in between them.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,600
I'm always in between Umama and
Bill, and if they're at the

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,220
exact same point on
Tuesday, then I must be at

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,000
that point as well.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,360
Or at least I must approach it.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,290
So let me write it
in math terms.

57
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,880
   

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:18,730
So all it says is that, over
some domain, if I say that,

59
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,300
let's say that g of x is less
than or equal to f of x, which

60
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,310
is less than or equal to
h of x over some domain.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:38,720
And we also know that the limit
of g of x as x approaches a is

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,070
equal to some limit, capital L,
and we also know that the limit

63
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:52,140
as x approaches a of h of x
also equals L, then the squeeze

64
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,200
theorem tells us-- and I'm not
going to prove that right

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,540
here, but it's good to just
understand what the squeeze

66
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,700
theorem is-- the squeeze
theorem tells us then the limit

67
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,770
as x approaches a of f of x
must also be equal to L.

68
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,230
And this is the same thing.

69
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,090
This is example where f of x,
this could be how much Sal eats

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,410
in a day, this could be how
much Umama eats in a

71
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,330
day, this is Bill.

72
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,980
So I always eat more than
Umama or less than Bill.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,190
And then on Tuesday, you could
say a is Tuesday, if Umama had

74
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,650
300 calories and Bill had 300
calories, then I also had

75
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,480
to eat 300 calories.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,350
Let me let me graph
that for you.

77
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,470
Let me graph that, and I'll
do it in a different color.

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,790
Squeeze theorem.

79
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,560
   

80
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,050
Squeeze theorem.

81
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:51,942
OK, so let's draw the
point a comma L.

82
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,980
The point a comma L.

83
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,840
Let's say this is a, that's
the point that we care

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,900
about. a, and this is L.

85
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,770
And we know, g of x, that's
the lower function, right?

86
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,540
So let's say that this
green thing right

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
here, this is g of x.

88
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,030
So this is my g of x.

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,110
And we know that as g of x
approaches-- so the g of x

90
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,120
could look something
like that, right?

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,910
And we know that the limit
as x approaches a of

92
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,510
g of x is equal to L.

93
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,590
So that's right there.

94
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,860
So this is g of x.

95
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,510
That's g of x.

96
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,590
Let me do h of x in
a different color.

97
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,570
So now h of x could look
something like this.

98
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,790
   

99
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,740
Like that.

100
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,870
So that's h of x.

101
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,970
And we also know that the limit
as x approaches a of h of x --

102
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,610
let's see, this is the
function of x axis.

103
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,630
So you can call it h of
x, g of x, or f of x.

104
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,350
That's just the dependent
access, and this is the x-axis.

105
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,790
So once again, the limit as x
approaches a of h of x, well

106
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,570
at that point right there,
h of a is equal to L.

107
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,965
Or at least the limit
is equal to that.

108
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,470
   

109
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,530
And none of these functions
actually have to even be

110
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,210
defined at a, as long as these
limits, this limit exists

111
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,110
and this limit exists.

112
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,790
And that's also an important
thing to keep in mind.

113
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,730
So what does this tell us?
f of x is always greater

114
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:24,860
than this green function.

115
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,350
It's always less
than h of x, right?

116
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,910
So any f of x I draw,
it would have to be in

117
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,080
between those two, right?

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,800
So no matter how I draw it, if
I were to draw a function,

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,600
it's bounded by those two
functions just by definition.

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,500
So it has to go
through that point.

121
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,910
Or at least it has to
approach that point.

122
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,060
Maybe it's not defined at that
point, but the limit as we

123
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,950
approach a of f of x also
has to be at point L.

124
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,580
And maybe f of x doesn't have
to be defined right there, but

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,940
the limit as we approach
it is going to be L.

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,920
And hopefully that makes a
little bit of sense, and

127
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,250
hopefully my calories
example made a little

128
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,820
bit of sense to you.

129
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,970
So let's keep that in
the back of our mind,

130
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,860
the squeeze theorem.

131
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:11,970
And now we will use that to
prove that the limit as x

132
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,310
approaches 0 of sine of
x over x is equal to 1.

133
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,940
And I want to do that,
one, because this is

134
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,990
a super useful limit.

135
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,600
And then the other thing is,
sometimes you learn the squeeze

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,770
theorem, you're like, oh, well
that's obvious but

137
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,890
when is it useful?

138
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,090
And we'll see.

139
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,520
Actually I'm going to do it in
the next video, since we're

140
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,590
already pushing 8 minutes.

141
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,340
But we'll see in the next video
that the squeeze theorem is

142
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,500
tremendously useful when
we're trying to prove this.

143
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,080
I will see you in
the next video.

144
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,400
