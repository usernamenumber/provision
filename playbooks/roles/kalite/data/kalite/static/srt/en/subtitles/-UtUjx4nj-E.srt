1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,350
Actually, before moving on to
the next problem, sometimes at

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,980
the end of a video I really rush
it, just because I have

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,330
that silly YouTube 10
minute deadline.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,270
And I want you to really
understand this point here, of

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,200
why I picked the negative
2 and the positive 3.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,670
Let me erase some of this and
kind of show you what my

8
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,805
thought process was.

9
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,740
So I'm using the paintbrush
tool.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,460
Let me just blank it all out.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:35,830
So if I just blank that
out, and I could

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,730
actually blank this out.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm just blanking
everything out.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,930
   

15
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,790
I could have just erased
everything, but anyway.

16
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,970
   

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,860
So the possible terms again,
once again, were 0 plus or

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,550
minus 2, and 5 plus
or minus 3.

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,790
And I want to show you why I
picked the lowest value here,

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,510
and the highest value here.

21
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,160
So let me graph those points.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,120
   

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,710
That's my y-axis.

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,020
This is my x-axis.

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,660
   

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,140
And so, first I have
the point, 0 comma

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,410
plus 2 or minus 2.

28
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:30,580
So this is 0, 2.

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,830
This is 0, minus 2.

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,880
   

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,670
And then we have 5.

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,340
Let's say this is 5 out here.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm going to say this
is 3 up here.

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,310
This is 5, positive 3, and then
5, negative 3 will be

35
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,960
someplace around here,
just not scaled up.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
I have to squeeze at the bottom,
but you get the point.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,970
   

38
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,050
So there's a bunch of lines that
could connect this whole

39
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,880
set of points, right?

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,660
I'm going to do them in
different colors.

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,380
You have this line.

42
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,150
You have this line.

43
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,010
You have this line.

44
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,650
And then you have this line.

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,070
Well, we want the highest
possible slope.

46
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,290
And you could probably just
inspect it and say, well, the

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,540
highest possible slope is the
one that moves up the

48
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,310
steepest. So it'll
be this line.

49
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,850
And this line and this line are
negative slopes, so that's

50
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,820
not a high slope.

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,230
And the way I did it,
intuitively, I said, well, in

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,280
order to have a high slope,
I want as high a

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,690
change in y as possible.

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:49,480
I want to maximize my change
in y, given my change in x.

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,280
And that's why I picked the
lowest y and the highest y.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,330
If I wanted the lowest possible
slope, I would have

57
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,150
picked positive 2
and negative 3.

58
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,350
Hopefully that makes a little
bit more sense.

59
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:11,720
Let's see, let's do
problem number 18.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,930
Esther drove to work in the
morning at an average speed of

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,610
45 miles per hour.

62
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,690
45 miles per hour is how
fast Esther drove.

63
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,940
So this is to work.

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,420
   

65
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,540
She returned home in the
evening, along the same route

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,370
at an average of 30
miles per hour.

67
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,900
30 miles per hour-- maybe
there was more

68
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,980
traffic-- from work.

69
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,460
   

70
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,460
If Esther spent a total of one
hour commuting to and from

71
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:54,710
work, so one hour total, how
many miles did Esther drive to

72
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,750
work in the morning?

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,620
So this is a simple distance
is equal to rate

74
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,890
times to time problem.

75
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,635
But it's a little fancy.

76
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,380
It gets a little confusing.

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,020
So let's just say that d is
the distance to work.

78
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,290
And then we'll just solve
for d, right?

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:24,190
So if d is the distance to work,
how far did she go in

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,180
the morning?

81
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,840
So in the morning we have the
distance she went in the

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,790
morning is going to be equal
to 45 miles per hour.

83
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,750
That's the rate.

84
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,290
45 miles per hour
times the time.

85
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,880
So let's just call
that times t.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,510
That's what she did
in the morning.

87
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,500
She went 45 miles an
hour times however

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,160
long it took her.

89
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,300
Then in the afternoon, she's
going to go to the same

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,340
distance, right?

91
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,020
This time she went 30
miles per hour.

92
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,890
   

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,540
Now, how long did it take her?

94
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,410
Well, this is the interesting
thing.

95
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,090
It took her a total of one
hour to go to work

96
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,670
and back from work.

97
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:18,110
If it took her t hours in the
morning, then it took her 1

98
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,370
minus t hours.

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,320
Actually, let's do
it in minutes.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,230
Let's assume t is in minutes.

101
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,740
So then one hour is 60,
60 minus t minutes.

102
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,990
Actually, I have to stay within
hours, because these

103
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,280
are all miles per hour.

104
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,010
So forgive me.

105
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,620
1 minus t.

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,220
Does that make sense?

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,570
This one, I think, will
make sense to you.

108
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,540
45 miles per hour times however

109
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,480
many hours she traveled.

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,390
It tells you how many
miles she went.

111
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,260
This time you have her speed,
30 miles per hour, times the

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,530
time she traveled.

113
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,350
Well, the time she traveled in
the afternoon is going to be

114
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,150
one hour minus whatever she
traveled in the morning.

115
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,500
Because when you combine in the
morning and afternoon, she

116
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,490
traveled for a total
of one hour.

117
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,485
For example, if she took 15
minutes to go in the morning,

118
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:14,060
then that means it took
her 45 minutes to

119
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,980
come back in the afternoon.

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,320
Hopefully that makes sense.

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,510
But these are the
same d's, right?

122
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,550
So we could set them equal
to each other.

123
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:31,500
So we could say 45 times t is
equal to 30 times 1 minus t.

124
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:31,870
Let me see.

125
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,290
45t is equal to 30 minus 30t.

126
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:43,960
And then we can add 30t to both
sides and you get 75t is

127
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,550
equal to 30.

128
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:51,000
Then we get t is equal
to 30/75 hours.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,905
And if we divide the top and
the bottom by 5, we get 6

130
00:06:56,905 --> 00:07:01,070
over-- 5 goes into this
how many times?

131
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,490
Actually, yeah, let
me divide it by 5.

132
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,430
5 goes into 10, 15, right?

133
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,460
I could divide by a better
number than 5.

134
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,815
Actually, I could divide the
top and the bottom by 15.

135
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:17,110
And you get 2/5.

136
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,600
Or just take this and divide
the top and bottom

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,420
by 3, you get 2/5.

138
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,680
So time is equal to 2/5 hours.

139
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,280
   

140
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,590
That's 24 minutes,
roughly, right?

141
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,600
So we go back to the distance.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,240
And remember, t is how long it
took her in the morning.

143
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,460
In the afternoon, it's going to
be 1 minus this, so in the

144
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,920
afternoon it took her
1 minus this.

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,420
This would be 3/5 hours.

146
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,940
The question is, how
many miles did she

147
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,110
go to and from work?

148
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,390
So that's d.

149
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,510
Well, d is 45 times t.

150
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,950
t is 2/5.

151
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,333
45 times 2/5 is d.

152
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,720
It comes to 9, cancel that,
so it comes to 8.

153
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,670
18, I mean.

154
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,050
9 times 2 is 18.

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,440
So d is equal to 18 miles.

156
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,910
And we are done, our
second SAT section.

157
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,530
I hope I didn't confuse
you too much.

158
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,000
See you soon.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,333
