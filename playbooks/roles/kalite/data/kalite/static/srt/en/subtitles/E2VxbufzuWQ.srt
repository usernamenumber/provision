1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,540
Well, now's as good a time
as any to go over some

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,670
interesting and very
useful properties

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,670
of the Laplace transform.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,620
And the first is to show that
it is a linear operator.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,230
And what does that mean?

7
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,840
Well, let's say I wanted to take
the Laplace transform of

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,270
the sum of the-- we call it the

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,590
weighted sum of two functions.

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,222
So say some constant, c1, times
my first function, f of

11
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:30,600
t, plus some constant,
c2, times my second

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,850
function, g of t.

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,560
   

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,590
Well, by the definition of the
Laplace transform, this would

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:45,280
be equal to the improper
integral from 0 to infinity of

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,810
e to the minus st, times
whatever our function that

17
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,220
we're taking the Laplace
transform of, so times c1, f

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,480
of t, plus c2, g of t-- I think
you know where this is

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,410
going-- all of that dt.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,820
And then that is equal to the
integral from 0 to infinity.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,780
Let's just distribute
the e the minus st.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,350
That is equal to what?

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:29,955
That is equal to c1e to the
minus st, f of t, plus c2e to

24
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:38,560
the minus st, g of t, and
all of that times dt.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,220
And just by the definition
of how the properties of

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,520
integrals work, we know that we
can split this up into two

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,650
integrals, right?

28
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,170
If the integral of the sum of
two functions is equal to the

29
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,580
sum of their integrals.

30
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,860
And these are just constant.

31
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,190
So this is going to be equal to
c1 times the integral from

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,860
0 to infinity of e to the minus
st, times f of t, d of

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,960
t, plus c2 times the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,840
minus st, g of t, dt.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,880
And this was just a very
long-winded way of saying,

36
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,410
what is this?

37
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,410
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t.

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,060
This is the Laplace transform
of g of t.

39
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,550
So this is equal to c1 times the
Laplace transform of f of

40
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:40,430
t, plus c2 times-- this is the
Laplace transform-- the

41
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,110
Laplace transform of g of t.

42
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,730
And so, we have just shown that
the Laplace transform is

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,210
a linear operator, right?

44
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,030
The Laplace transform of
this is equal to this.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,310
So essentially, you can kind of
break up the sum and take

46
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,830
out the constants, and just take
the Laplace transform.

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,720
That's something useful to
know, and you might have

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,260
guessed that was the
case anyway.

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,150
But now you know for sure.

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,640
Now we'll do something which
I consider even more

51
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,420
interesting.

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,730
And this is actually going to
be a big clue as to why

53
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,360
Laplace transforms are extremely
useful for solving

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,020
differential equations.

55
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:26,120
So let's say I want to find
the Laplace transform of f

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,380
prime of t.

57
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,050
So I have some f of t, I take
its derivative, and then I

58
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,100
want the Laplace transform
of that.

59
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,440
Let's see if we can find a
relationship between the

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
Laplace transform of the
derivative of a function, and

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,950
the Laplace transform
of the function.

62
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,180
So we're going to use some
integration by parts here.

63
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,700
   

64
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me just say what this
is, first of all.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,360
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity of e to the

66
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,390
minus st, times f
prime of t, dt.

67
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,940
And to solve this, we're going
to use integration by parts.

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,492
Let me write it in the
corner, just so you

69
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:08,180
remember what it is.

70
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,200
So I think I memorized it,
because I recorded that last

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,305
video not too long ago.

72
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm just going to write
this shorthand.

73
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,149
The integral of u-- well, let's
say uv prime, because

74
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,390
that will match what we have up
here better-- is equal to

75
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,790
both functions without the
derivitives, uv minus the

76
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,940
integral of the opposite.

77
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,720
So the opposite is u prime v.

78
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,550
   

79
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,550
So here, the substitution
is pretty clear, right?

80
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,460
Because we want to end up
with f of x, right?

81
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,880
So let's make v prime is f
prime, and let's make u e to

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,170
the minus st. So
let's do that.

83
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:58,140
u is going to be e to the minus
st, and v is going to

84
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,910
equal what?

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,150
v is going to equal
f prime of t.

86
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:14,070
And then u prime would be minus
se to the minus st. And

87
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,700
then, v prime-- oh, sorry,
this is v prime, right?

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,620
v prime is f prime of t, so
v is just going to be

89
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,720
equal to f of t.

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,090
I hope I didn't say that
wrong the first time.

91
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,270
But you see what I'm saying.

92
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,650
This is u, that's u, and
this is v prime.

93
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,320
And if this is v prime, then
if you were to take the

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,070
antiderivative of both sides,
then v is equal to f of t.

95
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,490
So let's apply integration
by parts.

96
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,030
So this Laplace transform, which
is this, is equal to uv,

97
00:05:51,030 --> 00:06:01,470
which is equal to e to the minus
st, times v, f of t,

98
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,150
minus the integral-- and, of
course, we're going to have to

99
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,570
evaluate this from
0 to infinity.

100
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,220
I'll keep the improper
integral with

101
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,960
us the whole time.

102
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,380
I won't switch back and forth
between the definite and

103
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,310
indefinite integral.

104
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,590
So minus this part.

105
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,650
So the integral from 0 to
infinity of u prime.

106
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:36,640
u prime is minus se to the
minus st times v--

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:43,590
v is f of t-- dt.

108
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,790
Now, let's see.

109
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,275
We have a minus and a
minus, let's make

110
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:47,390
both of these pluses.

111
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,580
This s is just a constant,
so we can bring it out.

112
00:06:49,580 --> 00:07:02,150
So that is equal to e to the
minus st, f of t, evaluated

113
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:07,550
from 0 to infinity, or as we
approach infinity, plus s

114
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,890
times the integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus st,

115
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,110
f of t, dt.

116
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,070
And here, we see,
what is this?

117
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,230
This is the Laplace transform
of f of t, right?

118
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,430
   

119
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,010
Let's evaluate this part.

120
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,310
So when we evaluated in
infinity, as we approach

121
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,350
infinity, e to the minus
infinity approaches 0.

122
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,960
f of infinity-- now this is
an interesting question.

123
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,180
f of infinity-- I don't know.

124
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,570
That could be large, that
could be small, that

125
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,400
approaches some value, right?

126
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
This approach 0, so
we're not sure.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,970
If this increases faster than
this approaches 0, then this

128
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,240
will diverge.

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,920
I won't go into the mathematics
of whether this

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,180
converges or diverges, but let's
just say, in very rough

131
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,030
terms, that this will converge
to 0 if f of t grows slower

132
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,000
than e to the minus
st shrinks.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,940
And maybe later on we'll do some
more rigorous definitions

134
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,300
of under what conditions
will this

135
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,810
expression actually converge.

136
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,290
But let's assume that f of t
grows slower than e to the st,

137
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:31,310
or it diverges slower than this
converges, is another way

138
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:31,910
to view it.

139
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,070
Or this grows slower
than this shrinks.

140
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,730
So if this grows slower than
this shrinks, then this whole

141
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,320
expression will approach 0.

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,730
And then you want to subtract
this whole expression

143
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,180
evaluated at 0.

144
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,805
So e to the 0 is 1 times f of
0-- so that's just f of 0--

145
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:57,030
plus s times-- we said, this is
the Laplace transform of f

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,810
of t, that's our definition--
so the Laplace

147
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,580
transform of f of t.

148
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,120
And now we have an interesting
property.

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,030
What was the left-hand side of
everything we were doing?

150
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,740
The Laplace transform
of f prime of t.

151
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,860
So let me just write
all over again.

152
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,850
And I'll switch colors.

153
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:25,710
The Laplace transform of f prime
of t is equal to s times

154
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:36,740
the Laplace transform of
f of t minus f of 0.

155
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,480
And now, let's just extend
this further.

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,090
What is the Laplace transform--
and this is a

157
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,800
really useful thing to know--
what is the Laplace transform

158
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,030
of f prime prime of t?

159
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,270
Well, we can do a little pattern
matching here, right?

160
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,960
That's going to be s times the
Laplace transform of its

161
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,000
antiderivative, times the
Laplace transform of f prime

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,750
of t, right?

163
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,020
This goes to this, that's
an antiderivative.

164
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,800
This goes to this, that's
one antiderivative.

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,520
Minus f prime of 0, right?

166
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,780
But then what's the Laplace
transform of this?

167
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:21,720
This is going to be equal to s
times the Laplace transform of

168
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,660
f prime of t, but what's that?

169
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,560
That's this, right?

170
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:35,550
That's s times the Laplace
transform of f of t, minus f

171
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,270
of 0, right?

172
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,360
I just substituted
this with this.

173
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,750
Minus f prime of 0.

174
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,380
And we get the Laplace transform
of the second

175
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,700
derivative is equal to s squared
times the Laplace

176
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:01,590
transform of our function, f
of t, minus s times f of 0,

177
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,430
minus f prime of 0.

178
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,840
And I think you're starting
to see a pattern here.

179
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,530
This is the Laplace transform
of f prime prime of t.

180
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,240
And I think you're starting
to see why the Laplace

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,390
transform is useful.

182
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,910
It turns derivatives into
multiplications by f.

183
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,510
And actually, as you'll see
later, it turns integration to

184
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,330
divisions by s.

185
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,070
And you can take arbitrary
derivatives and just keep

186
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,290
multiplying by s.

187
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,000
And you see this pattern.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,610
And I'm running out of time.

189
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,310
But I'll leave it up to you to
figure out what the Laplace

190
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,790
transform of the third
derivative of f is.

191
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,990
See you in the next video.

192
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
