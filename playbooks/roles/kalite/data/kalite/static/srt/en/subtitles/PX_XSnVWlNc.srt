00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:03,831
I want make a quick correction to the video on quasars.

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:10,333
In that video I said and I mistakenly said that the quasars or that the accretion disk that's really forming

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:18,566
or releasing the energy of the quasar, that its releasing energy predominately in the... the xray part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

4
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:23,277
And that was incorrect. Most quasars are actually emitting electromagnetic radiation

5
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:30,933
across the spectrum all the way from xrays... all the way from xrays as high frequency xrays all the way

6
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:39,000
down to infrared. All the way down to infrared. And some quasars even release super high frequency gammarays

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,498
and they will release low frequency electromagnetic waves all the way down to radio waves. So I just wanted

8
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:50,575
to make that correction. Its not predominately in the x-ray part of the spectrum, its across the spectrum

9
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:54,799
right over here. Its this entire range of the spectrum and sometimes even a wider range. Now the other

10
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,867
thing I want to clarify is this is the range of the spectrum thats being emitted. But we have to remember

11
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:05,815
that most or, actually all of these quasars are quite far away. The closest is 780 million light years away.

12
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:10,380
And many of them are many many billions of light years away. And so they are moving away from us

13
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,667
at a very fast speed, or... they are getting redshifted becuase the universe is expanding so fast relative

14
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:23,290
to us at that point or that coordinate is moving so fast away from our coordinate. And so even though this is

15
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,133
the spectrum that is beeing emitted its all going to be redshifted. Its all going to be redshifted

16
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:35,533
down and so we are going to observe things at a much, at a much lower frequency-- maybe around the radio

17
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:40,233
part of the frequency. So everything will be redshifted down. And thats why these were originally called

18
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:45,402
Quasi stellar radio sources. Any hopefully that clears things up a little bit.
