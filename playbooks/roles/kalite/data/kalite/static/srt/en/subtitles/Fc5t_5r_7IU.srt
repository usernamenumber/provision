1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,730
In the last video, we were able
to find the equation for

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,480
the regression line for these
four data points.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,460
What I want to do in this video
is figure out the r

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,760
squared for these data points.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,670
Figure out how good this
line fits the data.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,040
Or even better, figure out the
percentage-- which is really

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,640
the same thing-- of the
variation of these data

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,220
points, especially the variation
in y, that is due

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,760
to, or that can be explained
by variation in x.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,911
And to do that, I'm actually
going to get

12
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,010
a spreadsheet out.

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,120
I've actually tried to do this
with a calculator and it's

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,830
much harder.

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,710
So hopefully this doesn't
confuse you too much to use a

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,280
spreadsheet.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,650
And I'm a make a couple
of columns here.

18
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,440
And spreadsheets actually have
functions that'll do all of

19
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,280
this automatically, but I really
want to do it so that

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,360
you could do it by hand
if you had to.

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,040
So I'm going to make a couple
of columns here.

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,780
This is going to
be my x column.

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,360
This is going to
be my y column.

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,550
This is going to be the column--
I'll call this y

25
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,220
star-- this'll be the y value
that our line predicts based

26
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,930
on our x value.

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:08,930
This is going to be the
error with the line.

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,750
Let me caught it the squared
error with the line.

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:20,070
   

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,510
I don't want us to take
up too much space.

31
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:28,280
   

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:41,760
And then the next one, I'm
going to have the squared

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:56,040
variation for that y value
from the mean y.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,940
And I think these columns by
themselves will be enough for

35
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,680
us to do everything.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,220
So let's first put all
the data points in.

37
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,590
So we had negative 2
comma negative 3.

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,620
That was one data point.

39
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,740
Negative 1 comma negative 1.

40
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,889
And we had 1 comma 2.

41
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,010
Then we have 4 comma 3.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,145
Now, what does our
line predict?

43
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:21,360
Well our line says, you give
me an x value, I'm going to

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,530
tell you what y value
I'll predict.

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,920
So when x is equal to negative
2, the y value on the line is

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,230
going to be the slope.

47
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,060
So this is going to be equal
to 41 divided by

48
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,910
42 times our x value.

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,600
And I just selected that cell.

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,470
And just a little bit of a
primer on spreadsheets, I'm

51
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,020
selecting the cell D2.

52
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,680
I was able to just move my
cursor over and select that.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,200
But that tells me the x value.

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,670
Minus 5/21.

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,110
Minus 5 divided by 21.

56
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,080
Just like that.

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
So just to be clear of what
we're even doing.

58
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,650
This y star here, I
got negative 2.19.

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,260
That tells us at this
point right over

60
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:17,170
here is negative 2.19.

61
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,476
So when we figure out the error,
we're going to figure

62
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:25,600
out the distance between
negative 3, that's our y

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,860
value, and negative 2.19.

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,430
So let's do that.

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,970
So the error is just going to
be equal to our y value.

66
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,220
That's cell E2.

67
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,660
   

68
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,370
Minus the value that our
line would predict.

69
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,520
So just that value is
the actual error.

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,770
But we want to square it.

71
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:56,870
   

72
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,090
And then, the next thing
we want to do

73
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,480
is the squared distance.

74
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,730
so this is equal to the squared
distance of our y

75
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,315
value from the y's mean.

76
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:07,680
So what's the mean of the y's?

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,170
Mean of the y's is 1/4.

78
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,290
So minus 0.25, is the
same thing is 1/4.

79
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,260
And we also want
to square that.

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,720
Now, this is what's fun
about spreadsheets.

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,150
I can apply those formulas
to every row now.

82
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,330
And notice, what it did
when I did that.

83
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,430
Now all of a sudden, this is the
y value that my line would

84
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,590
predict, it's now using
this x value and

85
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,230
sticking it over here.

86
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,120
It's now figuring out the square
distance from the line

87
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,170
using what the line would
predict and using the

88
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,630
y value, this one.

89
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,010
And then does the same
thing over here.

90
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,090
It's figures out the squared
distance of this y

91
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,060
value from the mean.

92
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,650
So what is the total squared
error with the line?

93
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,620
So let me just sum this up.

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,040
The total squared error
with the line is 2.73.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,920
And then the total variation
from the mean, squared

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,560
distances from the mean
of the y, are 22.75.

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,790
So let me be very clear
what this is.

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,350
So let me write these
numbers down.

99
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,230
I'll write it up here so we
can keep looking at this

100
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,890
actual graph.

101
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,400
So are squared error versus our
line, our total squared

102
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,600
error, we just computed
to be 2.74.

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,860
I rounded a little bit.

104
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,240
And what that is, is you take
each of these data points'

105
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,500
vertical distance to the line.

106
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,050
So this distance squared, plus
this distance squared, plus

107
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,740
this distance squared, plus
this distance squared.

108
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,030
That's all we just calculated
on Excel.

109
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,450
And that total squared variation
to the line is 2.74.

110
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,680
Or total squared error
with the line.

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,380
And then the other number we
figured out was the total

112
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,190
distance from the mean.

113
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,780
So the mean here is
y is equal to 1/4.

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,980
So that's going to be
right over here.

115
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,510
   

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,590
This is 1/2.

117
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,840
So right over here.

118
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,505
   

119
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,070
So this is our mean y value.

120
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,970
   

121
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,630
Or the central tendency
for our y values.

122
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,590
And so what we calculated next
was the total error, the

123
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,730
squared error, from the
means of our y values.

124
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,850
That's what we calculated over
here in the spreadsheet.

125
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,320
You see in the formula.

126
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,690
It is this number, E2, minus
0.25, which is the mean of our

127
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,150
y's squared.

128
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,300
That's exactly what
we calculated.

129
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,170
We calculated for each
of the y values.

130
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,210
And then we summed
them all up.

131
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,820
It's 22.75.

132
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:58,470
It is equal to 22.75.

133
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,600
So this is essentially
the error that the

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,570
line does not explain.

135
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,060
This is the total error,
this is the total

136
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,330
variation of the numbers.

137
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,760
So if you wanted to know the
percentage of the total

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,700
variation that is not explained
by the line, you

139
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,680
could take this number divided
by this number.

140
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,090
So 2.74 over 22.75.

141
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:39,440
This tells us the percentage
of total variation not

142
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,050
explained by the line or
by the variation in x.

143
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,210
   

144
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,000
And so what is this number
going to be?

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,590
I can just use Excel for this.

146
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,500
So I'm just going to divide this
number divided by this

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,290
number right over there.

148
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,430
I get 0.12.

149
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:16,000
So this is equal to 0.12.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,300
Or another way to think about
it is 12% of the total

151
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,870
variation is not explained
by the variation in x.

152
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,510
The total squared distance
between each of the points or

153
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,260
their kind of spread, their
variation, is not explain by

154
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,170
the variation in x.

155
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,240
So if you want the amount that
is explained by the variance

156
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,579
in x, you just subtract
that from 1.

157
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,490
So let me write it
right over here.

158
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,669
So we have our r squared, which
is the percent of the

159
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,820
total variation that is
explained by x, is going to be

160
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,350
1 the minus that 0.12 that
we just calculated.

161
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,540
   

162
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,610
Which is going to be 0.88.

163
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,180
So our r squared here is 0.88.

164
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,630
It's very, very close to 1.

165
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,170
The highest number
it can be is 1.

166
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,610
So what this tells us, or a way
to interpret this, is that

167
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:18,210
88% of the total variation of
these y values is explained by

168
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,610
the line or by the
variation in x.

169
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,230
   

170
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,040
And you can see that it looks
like a pretty good fit.

171
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,610
Each of these aren't too far.

172
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,970
   

173
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,790
Each of these points are
definitely much closer to the

174
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,510
line than they are
to the mean line.

175
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,010
   

176
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,830
In fact, all of them are closer
to our actual line than

177
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,630
to the mean.

178
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,134
