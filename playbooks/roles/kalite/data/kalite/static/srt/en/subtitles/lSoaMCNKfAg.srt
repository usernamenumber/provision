1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,070
Say I have a vector v that's
a member of Rn.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,260
So it's got n components
in it.

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,850
So v1, v2, all the
way down to vn.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,990
I've touched on the idea before,
but now that we've

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,090
seen what a transpose is, and
we've taken transposes of

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,610
matrices, there's no reason
why we can't take the

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,900
transpose of a vector, or a
column vector in this case.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,800
So what would v transpose
look like?

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,659
Well if you think of this as a n
by 1 matrix, which it is, it

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,200
has n rows and one column.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,990
Then what are we going to get?

13
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,160
We're going to have a 1 by n
matrix when you take the

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,060
transpose of it.

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,125
And this one column is going
to turn into the one row.

16
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:47,380
So you're going to have
it be equal to v1, v2,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,270
all the way to vn.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,830
And you might remember, we've
already touched on this in a

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,630
lot of matrices before.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,980
Let's say that's
some matrix A.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,960
We called the row vectors of
those matrix, we called them

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,500
the transpose of some column
vectors, a1 transpose, a2

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,480
transpose, all the way
down to an transpose.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,820
In fact, not so many videos ago
I had those row vectors,

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,510
and I could have just called
them the transpose of column

26
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,660
vectors, just like that.

27
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,430
And that would have been, in
some ways, a better way to do

28
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,160
it because we've defined all
these operations around column

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,760
vectors, so you could always
refer to the transpose of the

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,140
transpose and then do some
operations on them.

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,480
But anyway, I don't want
to get too diverted.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,030
But let's think a little bit
of what happens when you

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,730
operate this vector, or you take
some operation of this

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,230
vector with some
other vectors.

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,940
So let's say I have another
vector here that's w, and it's

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,080
also a member of Rn.

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,760
So you have w1, w2, all
the way down to wn.

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,340
There's a couple of things that
we're already, I think,

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,140
reasonably familiar with.

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,740
You could take the dot
product of v and w.

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,710
v dot w is equal to what?

42
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:10,759
It is equal to v1 times w1, plus
v2, w2, and you just keep

43
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,760
going all the way to vn, wn.

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,420
This is the definition
of the dot product

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,540
of two-column vectors.

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,470
Now, how can we relate that to
maybe the transpose of v?

47
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,050
Well, we could take the
transpose of v-- let me write

48
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,410
it this way-- what is-- if I did
a matrix multiplication,

49
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:36,160
so I did v1, v2, all the way
to vn-- so this is v

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,490
transpose, that's v transpose--
and I take the

51
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,750
product of that with w.

52
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,010
   

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,830
So I have w1, w2, all
the way down to wn.

54
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,740
Now, if I view these as just
matrices-- this is w right

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,220
here-- if I viewed these just
as matrices, is this

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,730
matrix-matrix product
well-defined?

57
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,640
Over here I have a
n by 1 matrix.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,250
Here I have a 1-- sorry.

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,230
Here, the first one I have is
a 1 by n matrix-- I have one

60
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,140
row and n columns.

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,350
And here I have an
n by 1 matrix.

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,930
I have n rows and
only one column.

63
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,190
So this is well-defined.

64
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,490
I have the same number
of columns here

65
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,740
as I have rows here.

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,050
This is going to result
in a 1 by 1 matrix.

67
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,520
And what's it going
to look like?

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,270
It's going to equal to v1 times
w1-- let me write it

69
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,530
like this-- v1, w1 plus
v2, w2-- it's only

70
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,250
going to have one entry.

71
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,670
We could write it is as just
a 1 by 1 matrix like that.

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,280
Let me just do it-- 1 by
1 matrix like that.

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,270
v1, w1 plus v2, w2-- let me
just, I could write v2 there--

74
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,260
plus all the way to vn, wn.

75
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,820
That's what it'll be.

76
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,370
It'll just be a 1 by 1 matrix
that looks like that.

77
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,360
But you might notice that
these two things are

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,420
equivalent.

79
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:15,950
So we can make the statement
that v dot w, which is the

80
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,980
same thing as w dot v, these
things are equivalent to-- v

81
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,450
dot w is the equivalent of-- let
me just write it once over

82
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,860
here-- v dot w is the same thing
as the transpose of v, v

83
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:39,040
transpose times w as just
a matrix-matrix product.

84
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,470
So if you view v as a matrix,
take its transpose and then

85
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,150
just take that matrix and take
the product of that with w,

86
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,440
it's the same thing
as v dot w.

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,140
So that's an interesting
take-away.

88
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,620
I guess you could argue somewhat
obvious, and we've

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,420
already been referring this--
when I defined matrix-matrix

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,850
products, I kind of said you're
taking the dot product

91
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,960
of each row with each column,
and you can see that it really

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,180
is, it's really the dot product
of the transpose of

93
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,640
that row with each column, but
you got the general idea.

94
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,390
But let's see if we can build
on this a little bit.

95
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:14,380
Let's say I have some matrix
A-- let me save our little

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,560
outcome that I have there--
let's say I have some-- let me

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,820
get a good color here-- let's
say I have some matrix A and

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,653
it's an m by n matrix.

99
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:26,170
   

100
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,980
Now if I were to multiply that
times a vector x, so I'm going

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,220
to multiply it by some vector
x-- and let's say that x is a

102
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,575
member-- let me write it this
way-- x is a member of Rn.

103
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,950
So it has n elements.

104
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,670
Or another way you could view it
is, it's an n by 1 matrix.

105
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,260
Now when I take the product of
these, what am I going to get?

106
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,850
Or another way to say it is,
what is the vector Ax?

107
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,520
When I take this product, I'm
just going to get another

108
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,090
vector, and what's
it going to be?

109
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,640
It's going to be an
m by 1 vector.

110
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,190
   

111
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,400
So we could say that Ax
is a member of Rm.

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
It's going to have m
elements, right?

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,790
If this was equal to, if you
said that Ax equal to, I don't

114
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,780
know, let's say it's equal to
z, z would have m elements.

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,370
You would have z1, z2, all
the way down to zm.

116
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,420
And I know that because you have
m rows in A, and you have

117
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,870
only one-- well you could
say this is m by n,

118
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,140
this is n by 1.

119
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,680
The resulting product will be
m by 1, or it'll be a vector

120
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
that is a member of Rm-- it'll
have exactly m elements.

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,890
Now, if that's a vector of Rm,
then the idea of dotting this

122
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,800
with another member of
Rm is well-defined.

123
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,870
So let's say that I have
another member of Rm.

124
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,370
Let's say I have a vector y.

125
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,120
Let's say y is also
a member of Rm.

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,800
This has-- the vector Ax, the
vector that you get when you

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,130
take this product, has m
elements, this has m elements.

128
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,480
So the idea of taking their dot
product is well-defined.

129
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,270
Let me write that.

130
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:18,870
So you could take Ax, that's a
vector, and now we are dotting

131
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,290
it with this vector right here
and we'll get a number.

132
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,420
We just take each of their
terms, multiply the

133
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,210
corresponding terms, add
them all up, and you

134
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,510
get their dot product.

135
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,460
But what is this equal to?

136
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,980
We can just use this little,
I guess you could call it a

137
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,080
result, that we got earlier
on in this video.

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,380
Using this result, the dot
product of two matrices-- or

139
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,900
sorry, the dot product of two
vectors is equal to the

140
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,650
transpose of the first vector
as a kind of a matrix.

141
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,160
So you can view this
as Ax transpose.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:02,600
This is a m by 1,
this is m by 1.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,370
Now this is now a 1 by m
matrix, and now we can

144
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,165
multiply 1 by m matrix
times y.

145
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,880
   

146
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,290
Just like that.

147
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,390
Now what is this
thing equal to?

148
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,040
We saw a while ago, I think it
was two or three videos ago,

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,100
we saw that if we take the
product of two matrices and

150
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,400
take its transpose, that's equal
to the reverse product

151
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,140
of the transposes.

152
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,870
You switch the order and then
take the transposes.

153
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,280
So this is going to be equal
to-- this purple part-- is

154
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:43,090
going to be equal to
x transpose times A

155
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,470
transpose times y.

156
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,070
And this is just matrix
products.

157
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,230
These are matrix products.

158
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,990
These aren't necessarily
vector operations.

159
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,265
We're treating all of these
vectors as matrices.

160
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:57,890
And of course, we're treating
the matrix as a matrix.

161
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,640
So what is this equal to?

162
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Well we know that matrix
products are associative.

163
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,540
You could put a parentheses--
right now we have a

164
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,370
parentheses around there from
there, but we could just take

165
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,390
another association.

166
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:18,060
We could say that that is equal
to x transpose times

167
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,070
these two matrices
times each other.

168
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,815
This is a vector, but
you can represent it

169
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,980
as an m by 1 matrix.

170
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,485
Times A transpose y.

171
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,180
   

172
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,580
Just like that.

173
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,440
Now let's think about what
A transpose y is.

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
Let's think about it.

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,930
A transpose-- we have
here a is m by n.

176
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,870
What is A transpose?

177
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,880
A transpose is going to
be n by m, right?

178
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,020
It's going to be an m by n.

179
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,760
So this is an m by n.

180
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,230
And then what is this vector
y going to be?

181
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,890
This is an m by 1.

182
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,960
So when you take this product,
you're going to

183
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,390
get an n by 1 matrix.

184
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,040
Or you could imagine this as a
vector that is a member of Rn.

185
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,280
So this is a member of Rn.

186
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,050
The entire product is going to
result with a vector that's a

187
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,740
member of Rn.

188
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,810
And of course, it's well-defined
because this is a

189
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,900
1 by n vector right there.

190
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,540
Now we can go back
to our identity.

191
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,100
We have the transpose of some
vector times some other

192
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,010
vector-- they have the same,
well I guess you could say

193
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,730
this has as many horizontal
entries as this guy has

194
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,390
vertical entries,
just like that.

195
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,330
So what is this equal to?

196
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,830
We just use that identity.

197
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,090
This is equal to, the just
regular x in this case,

198
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,740
instead of x transpose
we'll just have x.

199
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:52,350
So this is equal to x dot--
remember, we just un-transpose

200
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,075
it, I guess you can view it that
way-- dot A transpose y.

201
00:10:57,075 --> 00:11:01,090
   

202
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,860
Which is a pretty
neat outcome.

203
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,470
We got this being
equal to that.

204
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,350
We can kind of change the
associativity, although we

205
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,880
have to essentially change the
order a bit and take the

206
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,630
transpose of our matrix.

207
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,630
So let me re-write that
just so that you can

208
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,670
remember the outcome.

209
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,100
So the two big outcomes of this
video are-- I'll rewrite

210
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:27,290
this one up here-- v dot w is
equal to the matrix product of

211
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,050
v transpose times w.

212
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,540
And if I have some matrix--
you assume all of these

213
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,920
matrix-vector products are
well-defined and all the dot

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,340
products are well-defined.

215
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:48,000
If I have Ax dot y, some other
vector y, this is equivalent

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,680
to x dot-- you're essentially
putting the A with the other

217
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,650
vector-- A transpose times y.

218
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,620
And this just might be a useful
outcome, or a useful

219
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,260
result, that we could build
upon later in the linear

220
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,190
algebra playlist.
