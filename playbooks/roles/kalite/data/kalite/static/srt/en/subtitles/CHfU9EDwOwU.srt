1
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:11,427
We're in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, looking at an enormous wall painting on plaster.

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:16,993
This is from the east gable of the Guangsheng lower temple in Shanxi province.

3
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:20,358
This temple was rediscovered in the 1930s because

4
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:24,971
a full set of the Buddhist scriptures, known as sutras, was found at this temple complex.

5
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:30,884
And it put this monastery on the map. The monks decided to take down the murals

6
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,064
and sell them in order to restore the building. This was taken down,

7
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:37,389
and I believe sold to a dealer, who then sold it

8
00:00:37,389 --> 00:00:39,836
to Arthur Sackler, and then in 1964,

9
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:42,970
Arthur Sackler gave it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

10
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,012
It's gorgeous. But it's so unusual for me. I'm used to looking at

11
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,236
Chinese scroll painting. How common is wall painting?

12
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:52,238
Actually, the first important format for painting in China

13
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:55,868
was wall painting. And we know this from textual sources and have found

14
00:00:55,868 --> 00:01:00,304
secular subject matter in the last fifty years or so. But in northwest China,

15
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:05,927
the Mogao cave sites have a huge encyclopedia, really, of Buddhist wall painting

16
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,303
stretching from the fourth to the fourteenth century.

17
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:14,235
Palaces and temples all over China had wall painting, and wall painting was a very important format that has not survived.

18
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:18,760
So this painting is from the very early fourteenth century, and by this time,

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,846
Buddhism had been in China for about a thousand years. So this is an extremely well developed system of representation.

20
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:28,871
Yes, this is from the Yuan Dynasty. These were foreign rulers in China.

21
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:34,428
So when this was painted, China was actually undergoing a significant political transformation.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,070
The Mongols were now in control of China, as opposed to the Han.

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,428
The Mongols had unified China, and

24
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:43,762
in the court, a very different style of painting was adopted.

25
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:49,456
It was a style much more associated with Himalayan art, Tibetan art.

26
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:55,927
I am seeing this extraordinary contrast between the bodhisattvas and the representation of Buddha.

27
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,679
Buddha seems so spare.

28
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:03,845
It seems to be very restrained style, as opposed to this dance costume, full of jewelry.

29
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:10,261
The Buddha has relinquished all worldly ties and thus is presented in the garb of a monk.

30
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:15,904
The bodhisattvas, while highly enlightened beings, have vowed to remain

31
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:23,871
in the earthly realm to help all sentient beings find release from samsara, which is the endless cycle of rebirth,

32
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,872
and in that regard, they are presented still in princely garb.

33
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,678
The Buddha is represented in lotus posture.

34
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:35,095
The hand gestures of the Buddha are known as mudras, and often

35
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:40,345
the specific hand gestures give us an indication of which buddha is being represented.

36
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,647
So I'm a little confused because

37
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:45,426
I'm looking at this central Buddha.

38
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:50,070
I'm seeing the long earlobes, I'm seeing the little rise on the back of the head, and

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,503
I was assuming that this was the historic Buddha.

40
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:56,303
Are those characteristics that are carried over to other buddhas as well?

41
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:59,928
Buddhism started in the northern plains in India and spread to China.

42
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:02,761
Initially the Buddha was a person.

43
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,928
He was not a god. That's the historical Buddha Shakyamuni.

44
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:08,346
He was born in the foothills of the Himalayas.

45
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:14,237
As the religion developed, the type of Buddhism that spread in China is called Mahayana.

46
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:18,638
In the Mahayana belief system, there are buddhas presiding over paradises everywhere.

47
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:24,737
This painting is most likely a representation of the assembly of Bhaishajyaguru, the medicine buddha.

48
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:29,069
The other central thing to Mahayana Buddhism is the bodhisattva.

49
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,511
Because it's a religion of compassion and the bodhisattva is a compassionate figure,

50
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:39,371
a lot of worship was focused on the bodhisattva in Chinese Buddhism.

51
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:45,637
As we move down, we move from the celestial representation that we can see so clearly at the top to

52
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:52,405
a real structure. You can see the large bodhisattvas and Buddha are seated on lotus blossoms.

53
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:56,594
Then there is a pedestal below that, which is beautifully decorated,

54
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:01,004
and then below that we can see a series of secondary attendants seated

55
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:07,178
at our level as the painting as hung in the museum but would have been still quite high.

56
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:10,596
You can see a whole variety of offerings that are

57
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:13,845
isolated by a lotus pedestal and a halo behind.

58
00:04:13,845 --> 00:04:18,312
Whether or not we are looking at the large buddha, the bodhisattvas, or these figures

59
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:22,905
down at the bottom, there is such an emphasis on this beautiful, curvilinear form.

60
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:26,704
Almost everything is outlined with this very hard contour.

61
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:31,305
That's particularly apparent in the scarves that drape off all the figures.

62
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:35,929
You can see the movement and the flow is articulated through line.

63
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,371
Look at the way the fullness of the figures is articulated.

64
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,803
It also comes back to this thickening and thinning line.

65
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,761
But then also there's this fabulous color.

66
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:49,178
The color would have obviously been much more vibrant, and if you think of it in the temple complex,

67
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:55,972
it would have been in a space with other mural paintings but also with sculpture that would also have been highly pigmented.

68
00:04:55,972 --> 00:05:00,178
This is for a monastic environment. Is this meant to be instructive?

69
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:06,638
Buddhist painting was created by craftsmen, overseen by monks making sure that the iconography was correct.

70
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:10,039
Buddhist sculpture and Buddhist painting were used for didactic purposes.

71
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:17,345
There's such specific iconography. I find it fascinating that even now we're still not quite sure what the subject is.

72
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:22,096
i think it's interesting that in Chinese Buddhist art, there are still a lot of avenues for research.

73
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:26,096
It's an important reminder, that art history is a living thing. We still change our minds.
