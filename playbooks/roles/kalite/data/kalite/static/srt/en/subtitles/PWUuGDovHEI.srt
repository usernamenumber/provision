1
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:11,013
The basic tools are the same as the ancients.

2
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:14,044
It's hard and just giving a list of tools,

3
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:17,691
how does that translate into a beautiful work of art?

4
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,199
Working by hand, everything slows down and you can

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:28,638
think about what you're doing while you're doing it.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,090
You start roughing out, taking the bulk of weight off

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,384
with a point chisel which concentrates all the

8
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:38,502
force of your blow at one point

9
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,134
and bursts the stone away.

10
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,588
Your next step after that, having removed

11
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,301
the bulk of the material is to model your form

12
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,391
with a tooth chisel.

13
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:59,926
A tooth chisel is basically a comb and you use

14
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,494
a tooth chisel to model form while at the same time

15
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:06,465
remove stone fairly quickly.

16
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,942
Something to remember about marble carving,

17
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:15,316
it's very tactile.

18
00:01:15,316 --> 00:01:18,843
The way the stone bursts from a point chisel

19
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:23,932
or the way your tooth chisel just kind of swims

20
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,252
through the stone.

21
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:30,168
It's a hard material but you can jump into a piece

22
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,252
of space with these tools.

23
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:43,434
If you cut at a very oblique angle to the stone

24
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,064
you can get a finer surface.

25
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,936
If you're forcing the tool straight into the stone,

26
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:51,186
you can get quite a different texture.

27
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:05,594
The rasp is just a whole row of fine little teeth

28
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:09,871
cut into a piece of metal and you can then just rub

29
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,276
or grind this tool into the stone removing material

30
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,714
and really refine a plane.

31
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:19,382
Depending on how you use the tool you can really

32
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,633
emphasize certain forms.

33
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:31,672
If you kind of lose your ego

34
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:36,123
and just flow into the stone through your tools,

35
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:39,452
there's no end of possibilities of what you can do

36
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,830
inside that space.
