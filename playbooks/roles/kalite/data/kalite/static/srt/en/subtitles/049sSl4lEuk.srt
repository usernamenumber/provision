1
00:00:00,696 --> 00:00:09,702
we are in the national gallery in washington,

2
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:10,202
looking at alovely set of madonna and child

3
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:16,357
from about 1404. i suppose the stress is so lovely to me

4
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:24,538
the beautiful soft curls of the headdress that

5
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,115
she is wearing, feigning her face, ther is a curve upwards

6
00:00:26,115 --> 00:00:28,715
her face. madonna is often shown so beautiful

7
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:33,450
but the trouble here her sense of fear and sadness comes across

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,397
in suchan incredibly tender and in the way

9
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:41,380
her hand holds him back protectively,this is

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,214
that terrible quidid moment and looks out and us

11
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:47,869
its true and a sort of way of saying, we all know

12
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:50,498
what is going to happen. we all know what this means

13
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:53,545
but look at the price that i paid for this as amother

14
00:00:53,545 --> 00:00:57,392
anything that i see with this is so obviously

15
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,780
the relevance of the lessons of the 15th century

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,870
mary becoming so human in the way she does

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,804
describe christ looking so much more like a baby

18
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,664
than he did. be it a hundred years earlier

19
00:01:09,664 --> 00:01:11,948
the boy had chubby, not looking like a small man

20
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:15,054
but obviously we be comfortable with the notion

21
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:17,566
that here we have god in this divine figure in the

22
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:19,929
body of a child.that is looking down as would be his right

23
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,270
that suggests the visual placement of this painting

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,288
and instead of this fad called background that

25
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:27,787
we would have had a hundred years earlier

26
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,619
a babys cradle , a nithch for mary to occupy

27
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,039
so we are supposed to be very classical looking

28
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,592
and then that shadow that her body cast to the right

29
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:42,024
that we have a sense of real natural light coming from

30
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:45,839
the left casting a show, asense of her convincing

31
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,259
three dimensionality here. she is not a flat euphony

32
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,943
of figure anymore.that is brilliantand interestingly

33
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:55,243
she has that physicality that is expresed in

34
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:59,156
classical architecture but also you awe in the way

35
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,038
in which the shadow actually fathers the complex

36
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,836
contoversial arcchitecture. the lesson of mesachia

37
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:10,256
but on the other hand there is a kind of softnes and mracle

38
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:14,038
quality that isin;t in mesachia.so that this

39
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:18,485
beautiful curves around her face and down

40
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:23,766
you can see how it is but a likely feature

41
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:27,649
this lovely girl is showing. but slowly the girl is disappearing

42
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,412
and the halo is disappearing and it is just a recapcle in gold

43
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:34,698
like the gentle way in which he is held

44
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,950
and now that he is on the surround on the wedge

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,696
like a window there. sometimes as arefence

46
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:43,888
to that event she also monached from them

47
00:02:43,888 --> 00:02:47,742
she pretexed in fonder. how to remember in

48
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:51,542
looking at the paintng in the museum that it has been

49
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:55,243
down earthed to some conservation efforts.

50
00:02:55,243 --> 00:03:01,680
it seems about 600 years old and it could be so
