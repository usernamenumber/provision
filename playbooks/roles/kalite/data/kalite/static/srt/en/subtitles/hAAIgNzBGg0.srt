1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now ready for part B, and I've wiped all the salt off of my fingers

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I've had a glass of water, so I'm ready for some business.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find the second derivative of w with respect to t in terms of w

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Use the second derivative to determine whether your

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
answer in part a is an underestimate or overestimate

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for the amount of solid waste that the landfill contains at time t equals one-forth

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's do the -- first thing's first--

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's find the second derivative in terms of w

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, we already have the first derivative over here

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in part a I re-wrote it just with slightly different notation

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I'll just use this because I need to write down here

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I can still refer to this thing.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's just take the derivative of both sides of this

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of this differential equation with respect to t.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you take the derivatative of this left-hand side with respect to t

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you get the second derivative of w with respect to t

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a function of t is equal to-

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now you take the derivative of this with respect to t

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the same thing as 1 over 25 w t minus 12.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so when you take the derivative, that constant part drops off

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're just left with 1 over 25 times the derivative of w t

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me make that clear;

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the same thing as 1 over 25 w.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 over 25 w as a function of t minus 12

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one-twenty-fifth of 300 is 12.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You take the derivative of this, you get one-twenty-fifth

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the first derivative of w and then the derivative of this

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to t is just 0

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A constant, obviously, does not change with respect to t.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we get this right over here

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now this is the second derivative in terms of the first derivative,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the question asks us, "Write the second derivative

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in terms of w" but lucky for us, we know how to express this

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we know how to express this as a function of w.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They gave that to us in the problem. This was given.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is just me rewriting this in a different notation.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is going to be the same thing as 1 over 25

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 over 25 times the derivative of w.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the derivative of w is this. This is--

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the differential equation (inaudible)

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the derivative of w is this over here.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 1 over 25 times -- 1 over 25 times w t

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the function w as a function of t minus -- minus 300

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so we can say the second derivative-

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me write a little smaller so I don't waste space-

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the second derivative of w as a function of t

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to 1 over 625 times w as a function of t

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is a function of t minus 300.

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we've done the first part.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We've found out the second derivative of w in terms of just w

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's try to adddress the second part of their question.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we did the first part.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now use what we just figured out to determine whether your answer

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in part a is an underestimate or an overestimate

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the amount of solid waste that the landfill

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
contains at time one forth.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So in part a we found the slope.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We found the slope of the tangent line at time equals 0

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we use that slope to extrapolate out to 3 months

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or time equals one-forth -- one forth of a year.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, if the functions' w's slope over that forth

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was exactly the same slope of the tangent line

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or if that slope did not change

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then our extrapolation would be exactly right.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If w's slope is increasing over that time

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then our -- then our estimate would be an underestimate of the correct thing

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if the slope is decreasing over that time

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then our estimate would be an overestimate of

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the actual amount in the landfill.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And to figure out whether the slope is increasing or decreasing

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we just have to look at the value of the second derivative.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If the second derivative is positive

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that means our slope is increasing

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which means that our extrapolation would be an understatement.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me just be clear here.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me draw this.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me make it very clear.

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let me just draw a random function.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say that's w.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is a case where w's slope is increasing faster

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or w's slope is increasing from that starting point.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So our starting point -- this was our slope

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then w's slope keeps increasing from there.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in this case, our estimate is going to be an underestimate

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of where w actually is after a forth of the year.

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If w's slope is exactly the same as the function

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over the course of the year

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over the course of the first 3 months,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it would look something like that

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe it diverges later on.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in this case, our approximation would be really good

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it would probably be exact for w.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if w's slope for whatever reason goes negative after that point

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they already tell us that it's an increasing function

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that is, um, that is not likely
