1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
   

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,140
[MUSIC]

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,800
   

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,350
What I want to do in this
video is explain what a

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,220
mortgage is.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,360
I think most of us have at least
a general sense of it,

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,500
but even better than that,
actually go into to the

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,520
numbers and understand a little
bit of what you are

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,830
actually doing when you're
paying a mortgage, what it's

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,960
made up of, and how much of it
is interest verses how much of

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,100
it is actually paying
down the loan.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,760
So let's just start with
a little example.

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:35,550
Let's say that there is a house
that I like that I would

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,250
like to purchase.

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,990
It has a price tag of--
I need to pay

16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,880
$500,000 to buy that house.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,380
This is the seller of the house
right here, and they

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,630
have a moustache.

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,560
   

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,810
I would like to buy it.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,330
   

22
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,520
This is me right here, and
I've been able to save up

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,520
$125,000 but I would really like
to live in that house.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:19,000
So I go to a bank, and I say,
Mr. Bank, can you lend me the

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,490
rest of the amount I need
for that house, which is

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,020
essentially $375,000?

27
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:30,520
I'm putting 25% down, this
number right here that is 25%

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,880
of $500,000.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,330
So I ask the bank, can I have
a loan for the balance?

30
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,290
Can I have a $375,000 loan?

31
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,080
And the bank says, sure, you
seem like a nice guy with a

32
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,010
good job who has good credit
rating, I will give you the

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,190
loan but while you're paying
off the loan you can't have

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,680
the title of that house.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,080
We have to have that title of
the house and once you pay off

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,860
the loan, we're going to give
you the title of the house.

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,750
So what's going to happen here
is we're going to have-- the

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:11,980
loan is going to go to
me, so it's $375,000.

39
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,540
Then I can go and
by the house.

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:21,240
So I'm going to give the total
$500,000 to the seller of the

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,080
house and I'll actually move
into the house myself,

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,770
assuming I'm using it for
my own residence.

43
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,800
But the title of the house,
the document that says who

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:42,300
actually owns the house-- so
this is the home title-- it

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,590
will not go to me, it
will go to the bank.

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,020
The home title will go from the
seller, or maybe even the

47
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,170
seller's bank, because maybe
they haven't paid off their

48
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,640
mortgage, to the banking that
I'm borrowing from.

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,460
And this transferring of the
title to secure a loan, when I

50
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,450
say secure a loan, I'm saying,
look, I need to give something

51
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,980
to the lender in case I don't
pay back the loan

52
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,450
or if I just disappear.

53
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,940
So this is the security
right here.

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,210
That is technically what
a mortgage is.

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:19,350
This pledging of the title as
the security for the loan,

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,130
that's what a mortgage is.

57
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:28,167
And actually it comes from Old
French mort means dead and to

58
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,120
gage means pledge.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,250
I'm 100% sure I'm mispronouncing
it, but it

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,000
comes from dead pledge because
I'm pledging it now, but that

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,460
pledge will eventually die
once I pay off the loan.

62
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,660
Once I pay off this loan, this
pledge of the title to the

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,010
bank will die and it'll
come back to me.

64
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,710
And that's why it's called a
dead pledge or mortgage.

65
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,530
And probably because it comes
from Old French is the reason

66
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,480
why we don't say more mort
gage, we say mortgage.

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,920
But anyway, this is a little
bit technical, but normally

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,950
when people refer to a mortgage,
they're really

69
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,610
referring to the loan itself.

70
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,400
They're really referring
to the mortgage loan.

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,750
And what I want to do in the
rest of this video is use a

72
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,220
little screen shot from a
spreadsheet I made to actually

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,230
show you the math or actually
show you what your mortgage

74
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,000
payment is going to.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,050
And you can download this
spreadsheet sheet at

76
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,300
khanacademy.org/
downloads/mortgagecalculator.

77
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:40,080
   

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,640
Actually, even better, just go
the downloads folder and on

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,820
your web browser you'll see a
bunch of files and it'll be

80
00:04:47,820 --> 00:05:00,110
the file called
mortgagecalculator.xls, so

81
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,130
it's a Microsoft 2007 format.

82
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,110
So just go to this URL and then
you'll see all the files

83
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,050
there and you can just download
this file if you want

84
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,130
to play with it.

85
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,400
But what it does here, in this
kind of dark brown color,

86
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,680
these are the assumptions that
you can input and you can

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,030
change these cells in your
spreadsheet without breaking

88
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,030
the whole spreadsheet.

89
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,580
So here I assumed the
5.5% interest rate.

90
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,180
I'm buying a $500,000 home.

91
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,620
It's a 25% down payment, so
that's the $125,000 that I had

92
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,480
saved up that I talked about
right over there.

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,920
And then the loan amount, well,
I have $125,000, I'm

94
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,530
going to have to borrow
$375,000.

95
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,400
It calculates it for us and then
I'm going to get a pretty

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,460
plain vanilla loan, this is
going to be a 30-year, so when

97
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,970
I say term in years this
is how long the loan

98
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,210
is for, so 30 years.

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,250
It's going to be a 30-year
fixed rate

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,850
mortgage fixed rate.

101
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,410
Which means the interest
rate won't change.

102
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,360
We'll talk about that
in a little bit.

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,460
This 5.5% that I'm paying on the
money that I borrow will

104
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,720
not change over the course
of the 30 years.

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,590
We will see the amount I've
borrowed changes as I pay down

106
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,850
some of the loan.

107
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,940
And this little tax rate that
I have here, this is to

108
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,800
actually figure out what is
the tax savings of the

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,920
interest deduction on my
loan, and we'll talk

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,260
about that in a second.

111
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,680
You can ignore it for now.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,960
And these other things that
aren't in brown, you shouldn't

113
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,630
mess with these, if you actually
do open up the

114
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,750
spreadsheet yourself.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,070
These are automatically
calculated.

116
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,880
And this right here is the
monthly interest rate.

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,940
So it's literally the annual
interest rate,

118
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,220
5.5% divided by 12.

119
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,140
And most mortgage loans are
compounded on a monthly basis.

120
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,800
So at the end of every month,
they see how much money you

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,840
owe and then they will charge
you this much interest on that

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,050
for the month.

123
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,990
Now given all these assumptions,
there's a little

124
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,690
bit of behind-the-scenes math,
and in a future video I might

125
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,150
actually show you how to
calculate what the actual

126
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,260
mortgage payment is.

127
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,650
It's actually a pretty
interesting problem.

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:03,460
But for a $500,000 house, a
$375,000 loan, over 30 years

129
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,020
at a 5.5% interest rate, my
mortgage payment is going to

130
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,200
be roughly $2,100.

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,730
Now, right when I bought the
house-- I want to introduce a

132
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,580
little bit of vocabulary, and
we've talked about this in

133
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,400
some of the other videos.

134
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,260
There's an asset in question
right here,

135
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,750
it's called a house.

136
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,460
And we're assuming that
it's worth $500,000.

137
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,645
We're assuming it's worth
$500,000, that is an asset.

138
00:07:30,645 --> 00:07:33,210
It's an asset because it gives
you future benefit, the future

139
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,430
benefit of being able
to live in it.

140
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,420
Now there's a liability against
that asset, that's the

141
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,410
mortgage loan.

142
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,945
That's a $375,000 liability.

143
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:48,250
A $375,000 loan or debt.

144
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,600
So if this was your balance
sheet, if this was all of your

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,790
assets and this is all of your
debt, and if you were

146
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,420
essentially to sell the assets
and pay off the debt-- if you

147
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,360
sell the house you get the
title, you can get the money

148
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,650
then you pay it back
to the bank.

149
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,250
Well, actually it doesn't
necessarily go into that

150
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,420
order, but I won't
get to technical.

151
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,160
But if you were to unwind this
transaction immediately after

152
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,080
doing it, then you would have
a $500,000 house, you'd pay

153
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,190
off your $375,000 in debt, and
you would get in your pocket

154
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,770
$125,000, which is exactly
what your original down

155
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,720
payment was.

156
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,300
But this is your equity, and the
reason why I'm pointing it

157
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,060
out now is-- in this video,
I'm not going to assume

158
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,420
anything about the house price
whether it goes up or down.

159
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,800
We're assuming it's constant.

160
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,049
But you could not assume it's
constant and play with the

161
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,059
spreadsheet a little bit.

162
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,360
But I'm introducing this
because, as we pay down the

163
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,289
debt, this number is going
to get smaller.

164
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,270
So this number is
getting smaller.

165
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,540
Let's say at some point
this is only $300,000.

166
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,320
Then my equity is going
to get bigger.

167
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,190
So you can kind view equity as
how much value do you have

168
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,090
after you pay off the
debt for your house.

169
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,900
If you were to sell the house,
pay off the debt, what do you

170
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,190
have leftover for yourself?

171
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,930
So this is the real wealth
in the house.

172
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,670
This is what do you own, wealth
in house or the actual

173
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,530
what the owner has.

174
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,540
Now, what I've done here is--
well, actually before I get to

175
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,560
the chart, let me actually
show you how I

176
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,540
calculate the chart.

177
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,780
And I do this over the course
of 30 years and it goes by

178
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,300
month, so you can imagine that
there's actually 360 rows here

179
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,790
on the actual spreadsheet,
you'll see that if you go in

180
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,670
and open it up.

181
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,590
But I just want to show
you what I did.

182
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,270
So on month zero, which
I don't show here,

183
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,800
you borrowed $375,000.

184
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,200
Now, over the course of that
month, they're going to charge

185
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,100
you 0.46% interest. Remember,
that was 5.5% divided by 12.

186
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:47,430
0.46% interest on $375,000
is $1,718.75.

187
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,690
So I haven't made any mortgage
payments yet.

188
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,440
So I borrowed $375,000, this
much interest essentially got

189
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,390
built up on top of that,
it got accrued.

190
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,820
So now before I pay any of my
payments, instead of owing

191
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,530
$375,000 at the end of the first
month, I owe $376,718.

192
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,830
Now, I'm a good guy, I'm not
going to default on my

193
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,550
mortgage, so I make that first
mortgage payment that we

194
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,050
calculated right over here.

195
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,280
So after I make that payment,
then what's my loan balance

196
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,960
after making that payment?

197
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,450
Well, this was before making the
payment, so you subtract

198
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,030
the payment from it,
this is my loan

199
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,220
balance after the payment.

200
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,340
Now this right here with a
little asterisk here, this is

201
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,260
my equity now.

202
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,360
So remember, I started with
a $125,000 of equity.

203
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,230
After paying one loan balance,
after my first payment, I now

204
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,120
have a $125,410 in equity.

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
So my equity has gone
up by exactly $410.

206
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,050
Now you're probably saying,
hey, gee, I made a $2,000

207
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,840
payment and my equity only
went up by $410.

208
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,700
Shouldn't this debt have gone
down by $2,000 and my equity

209
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,450
have gone up by $2,000?

210
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,690
And the answer is no, because
you have to pay all of this

211
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,440
interest. So in the beginning,
your payment, your $2,000

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,880
payment is mostly interest. Only
$410 of it is principal.

213
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,840
But as your loan balance goes
down, you're going to pay less

214
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,860
interest here, and so each of
your payments are going to be

215
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,450
more weighted towards principal
and less weighted

216
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,020
towards interest. And then to
figure out the next line, this

217
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,800
interest accrued right here, I
took my loan balance exiting

218
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,590
the last month, multiply that
times 0.46%, you get this new

219
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,640
interest accued.

220
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,520
This is your new pre-payment
balance.

221
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,850
I pay my mortgage again, this
is my new loan balance.

222
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,770
And notice, already by month
two, $2 more went to

223
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,900
principal, and $2 dollars less
went to interest. And over the

224
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,530
course of 360 months, you're
going to see that it's an

225
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,870
actual sizable difference.

226
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,490
And that's what this chart
shows us right here.

227
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,870
This is the interest and
principal portions of our

228
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,620
mortgage payment.

229
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,150
So this entire height right
here-- let me scroll down a

230
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,760
little bit-- this is by month,
so this entire height, you

231
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:19,610
notice, this is exactly our
mortgage payment, this $2,129.

232
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:25,540
Now, on that very first month
you saw that of my $2,100,

233
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,990
only $400 of it went to
actually pay down the

234
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,560
principal, the actual
loan amount.

235
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,540
The rest of it went to pay down
interest, the interest

236
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,750
for that month.

237
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,410
Most of it went for the
interest of the month.

238
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,550
But as I start paying down the
loan, as the loan balance gets

239
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,470
smaller and smaller, each of
my payments, there's less

240
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,810
interest to pay-- let me do it
the better color than that.

241
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,090
Let's say we go out here,
this is month 198.

242
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,870
Over there, that last month,
there was less interest. So

243
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,250
more of my $2,100 actually goes
to pay off the loan until

244
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,970
we get all the way to month 360,
and you could see this in

245
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,640
the actual spreadhseet, at month
360 my final payment is

246
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,540
all going to pay off
the principal.

247
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,330
Very little, if anything,
of that is interest.

248
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,780
Now, the last thing I want to
talk about in this video,

249
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,380
without making it too long,
is this idea of a

250
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,840
interest tax deduction.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,130
So a lot of times, you'll hear
financial planners and

252
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,080
Realtors tell you, hey, the
benefit of buying your house

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,570
is that it has tax advantages,
and it does.

254
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,900
Your interest is
tax-deductible.

255
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,740
Your interest, not your
whole payment.

256
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:43,140
   

257
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,240
And I want to be very clear
what deductible means.

258
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,010
So first let's talk about
what interest means.

259
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,140
So this whole time over 30
years, I am paying $2,100 a

260
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,750
month or $2,129.29.

261
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,310
Now in the beginning, a lot of
that is interest. So on month

262
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,570
one, $1,700 of that was
interest. That $1,700 is

263
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,110
tax-deductible.

264
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,710
Now, as we go further and
further each month, I get a

265
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,850
smaller and smaller
tax-deductible portion of my

266
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,930
actual mortgage payment.

267
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,140
Out here, the tax deduction is
actually very small as I'm

268
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,240
getting ready to pay off my
entire mortgage and get the

269
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,450
title of my house.

270
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,380
Now I want to be very clear
on this notion of what

271
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,340
tax-deductible even means,
because I think it is

272
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,500
misunderstood very often.

273
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,550
   

274
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,650
Let's say in one year, I paid,
I don't know-- I'm going to

275
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,190
make up a number, I didn't
calculate it on the

276
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,670
spreadsheet.

277
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:48,830
Let's say in year one, I pay
$10,000 in interest. Remember,

278
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,760
my actual payments will be
higher than that, because some

279
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,890
of my payments went to actually
paying down the loan,

280
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,250
but let's say $10,000 went to
interest. And let's say before

281
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,650
this, I was making a $100,000
a year-- and let's put the

282
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,520
loan aside-- let's say I was
making $100,000 a year and

283
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,600
let's say I was paying roughly
35% on that $100,000.

284
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,040
I won't go into the whole tax
structure and the different

285
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,990
brackets and all of that.

286
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,410
Let's say, you know, if I didn't
have this mortgage, I

287
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,450
would pay 35% taxes, which
would be about $35,000 in

288
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,510
taxes for that year.

289
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,040
This is just a rough estimate.

290
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,100
Now, when you say that $10,000
is tax-deductible, the

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,470
interest is tax-deductible, that
does not mean that I can

292
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,980
just take it from the $35,000
that I would have normally

293
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,040
owed and only pay $25,000.

294
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,350
What it means is I can deduct
this amount from my income.

295
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,150
So when I tell the IRS how much
did I make this year,

296
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,550
instead of saying $100,000,
I say that I made $90,000

297
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,600
because I was able to deduct
this, not directly from my

298
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,530
taxes, I was able to deduct
it from my income.

299
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,870
So now if I only made $90,000
and-- I'm doing a gross

300
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,690
over-simplification of how
taxes actually get

301
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,750
calculated-- and I pay 35%
of that, let's get

302
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,000
the calculator out.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,470
   

304
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,910
So 90 times 0.35 is
equal to 31,500.

305
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:34,470
So this will be equal
to $31,500.

306
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,490
So off of a $10,000 deduction,
a deductible interest, I

307
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,140
essentially saved $3,500.

308
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,560
I did not save $10,000.

309
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,260
So another way to think about it
is, I pay $10,000 interest

310
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,880
and my tax rate is 35%, I'm
going to save 35% percent of

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,830
this in actual taxes.

312
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,020
This is what people mean when
they say deductible, you're

313
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,460
deducting it from the income
that you report to the IRS.

314
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,300
If there's something that you
actually could take straight

315
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,240
from your taxes, that's
called a tax credit.

316
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,500
So if there was some special
thing that you could actually

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,700
deduct it straight from your
taxes, that's a tax credit.

318
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,650
But a deduction just takes
it from your income.

319
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,035
And so on this spreadsheet, I
just want to show you that I

320
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,520
actually calculated in that
month how much of a tax

321
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,460
deduction do you get.

322
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,420
So, for example, just off of
the first month, you paid

323
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,010
$1,700 in interest of your
$2,100 mortgage payment.

324
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,700
So 35% of that, and I got
the 35% as one of your

325
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,190
assumptions, 35% of $1,700, I
will save $600 in taxes on

326
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,800
that month.

327
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,700
So roughly over the course of
the first year, I'm going to

328
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,110
save about $7,000 in taxes.

329
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,390
So that's nothing
to sneeze at.

330
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,000
Anyway, hopefully you found this
helpful, and I encourage

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
you to go to that spreadsheet
and play with the assumptions,

332
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,170
only the assumptions in this
brown color unless you really

333
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,090
know what you're doing with the
spreadsheet, and you can

334
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,960
see how this actually changes
based on different interest

335
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,970
rates, different loan amounts,
different down payments,

336
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,970
different terms, different
tax rates.

337
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,780
That'll actually change the tax
savings and you can play

338
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,570
around with the different types
of fixed mortgages on

339
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,390
this spreadsheet.

340
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,640
[MUSIC]

341
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:26,230
