1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:02,769
What I want to do in this video is think about

2
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,519
how the opportunity cost can change

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,601
as we move from scenario to scenario.

4
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,273
This is going to be particular to this example,

5
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:14,512
but it's a phenomenon that you will see in many economic scenarios.

6
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:17,301
So let's say we are starting off in Scenario F.

7
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,552
We are vegetarians. We are only getting berries.

8
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,849
We are not spending any time going after rabbits.

9
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,615
But now we are starting to, I guess, crave protein.

10
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,915
And we say well, what is going to be the opportunity cost

11
00:00:29,915 --> 00:00:32,249
if I go for that extra rabbit.

12
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:34,255
If I go for that extra rabbit,

13
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:36,263
then what's going to happen.

14
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:40,066
Well I'm going to have to stay on my production possibilities frontier,

15
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,947
and so I'm going to move to Scenario E,

16
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:44,349
so if I go after that one extra rabbit,

17
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:49,132
I'm going to give up 20 berries.

18
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,086
So my opportunity cost in Scenario F, sitting in Scenario F,

19
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:55,705
of going after that one rabbit, is 20 berries.

20
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:59,313
Now let's keep going. What happens if I'm in Scenario E?

21
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:02,855
I'm already on average eating one rabbit or finding one rabbit a day.

22
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,999
And I want to go to two rabbits a day.

23
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,547
What am I going to give up?

24
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:07,785
(Let me do that in the same color.)

25
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:09,474
What will I give up?

26
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:13,607
Well now I am going to give up 40 berries!

27
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,417
40 berries, this is interesting.

28
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:18,842
Now let's say we're in Scenario D

29
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:21,257
and we want even more rabbits.

30
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:24,840
We're really starting to become carnivores now.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,830
What am I going to give up?

32
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,987
Well I'm going to give up 60 berries.

33
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:32,478
If I'm able to get 3 rabbits every day on average,

34
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:35,964
then I'm only going to get 180 berries now, instead of 240.

35
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:37,843
Let's just keep going.

36
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:40,692
So if I want yet another rabbit every day,

37
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:45,511
then I'm going to have to give up 80 berries.

38
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,852
Then finally just to feel some sense of completion.

39
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,830
If I become a complete carnivore,

40
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,038
and if I want to get on average, 5 rabbits a day,

41
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,533
I'm going to have to give up another 100 berries

42
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,464
and go to not having any berries at all.

43
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,443
And so you might see something interesting:

44
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:01,580
the more squirrels, sorry not squirrels...

45
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,577
(Although I guess they're similar.)

46
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:05,527
The more rabbits that I'm going after...

47
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:09,267
Every time I try to go after another incremental rabbit,

48
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,168
I'm giving up more and more berries.

49
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:14,267
My opportunity cost is increasing.

50
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,601
So this phenomenon - it's not always the case -

51
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:26,989
but it's the case in this example...increasing opportunity cost.

52
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:29,686
As we increase the number of rabbits we're going after...

53
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:32,994
And you could do it the other way...as we increase...

54
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,215
especially if you did it on a unit basis.

55
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:38,406
if you said every incremental berry,

56
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,529
or every incremental hundred berries we're going after,

57
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:42,029
(But the numbers aren't as easy right over here.)

58
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,267
you'll actually see something going the other way.

59
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,428
But the question, an interesting question is:

60
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:49,915
Okay Sal, you set up the numbers like this earlier, two videos ago,

61
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:51,295
but why would this make sense?

62
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:54,498
Why is this idea of increasing opportunity cost

63
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:57,191
showing up in a lot of different economic,

64
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,953
and you could call this an economic model.

65
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,603
We've simplified our economic reality,

66
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:04,600
the choices that we have to make down to two variables:

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,589
the number of rabbits we have to go after or the number of berries.

68
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:10,473
But why does this show up in economic models?

69
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,375
And just to be clear, it doesn't show up in all of them.

70
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,675
But to think about our example as a hunter-gatherer,

71
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,368
we started here in Scenario F.

72
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:24,034
In Scenario F we've decided to not pursue any rabbits -

73
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:28,074
even the slower, not so quick-witted rabbit

74
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,866
who maybe likes to hang out with you, next to you.

75
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:35,904
And it likes to play with your spears, or bow and arrow.

76
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,153
You are not even going after that rabbit.

77
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:41,807
Instead you are choosing to spend all of your time on the berries.

78
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:45,197
And not only are you literally getting the low hanging fruit - the easy berries.

79
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:48,238
You're getting the berries that are further up the bush,

80
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:50,369
the berries that you have to get cut by thorns to get,

81
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,667
the berries you have to climb trees to get.

82
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,847
So you're getting even hard to get berries,

83
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,283
and you're not going after even easy to get rabbits.

84
00:03:58,283 --> 00:03:59,909
Now all of a sudden, if you say,

85
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,337
Well, you know, that rabbit who has been hanging out with me,

86
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,508
he's been kind of asking for it.

87
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,365
And so that was very easy to get.

88
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:07,882
It didn't take much time on a given day

89
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,915
to get those really easy rabbits who like to hang out with you.

90
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:15,764
You're not giving up a lot in terms of berries.

91
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,393
One, it didn't take you much time

92
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:21,987
to get those literally slow and maybe less quick-witted rabbits.

93
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:26,795
And you're giving up in that same amount of time the very hard to get berries.

94
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:28,667
So you're only going to give up about 20 of them.

95
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,859
Now if you want 2 rabbits a day,

96
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:35,110
not only are you going to get the slowest of the rabbits,

97
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,367
the ones who aren't afraid of humans,

98
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:41,352
now you're going to have to go after the slightly faster rabbit

99
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:45,164
who wants to die a little bit less, and who is maybe a little sharper.

100
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,835
And now you're not giving up the berries

101
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:50,482
that are way up in the tree and are protected by thorns,

102
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,542
you're giving up berries that are closer down the tree,

103
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:56,252
so this is going to take you a little more time to do than this right over here.

104
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,494
And in that little bit more time,

105
00:04:57,494 --> 00:05:01,023
you're also giving up berries that were easier to get.

106
00:05:01,023 --> 00:05:02,161
This phenomenon is going to happen

107
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:03,998
all the way until, you know, this scenario

108
00:05:03,998 --> 00:05:05,729
where you're trying to get 5 rabbits a day.

109
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,930
You are literally going after the quickest and the smartest rabbits.

110
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,983
But you insist on going after them,

111
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:13,465
and in your pursuit of these quick, fast rabbits,

112
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:16,963
you're even ignoring berries, you're literally stepping on berries,

113
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:18,867
you're not eating the berries that are right next to you

114
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:22,037
because you're so obsessed with eating rabbits.

115
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,248
So hopefully that gives you a sense of

116
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,194
why increasing opportunity cost does show up...

117
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:30,466
and when you graphically show it in terms of a production possibilities frontier,

118
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:33,426
it shows up in this bow shaped curve.

119
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:37,525
And you can see it because as we go from this point to this point,

120
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,375
you see as we increase one

121
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,097
the slope - the negative slope - is increasing.

122
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,584
So another way to think about it is, in Scenario F,

123
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:48,578
the slope is roughly like this.

124
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,467
And I encourage you to review the algebra playlist

125
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:54,104
if the idea of slope is confusing to you.

126
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,019
But at F, the slope is like that.

127
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,733
(I'm drawing the slope of the tangent line right over here.)

128
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,395
At E, it gets even steeper.

129
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:07,365
You're giving up even more of the berries per unit - rabbit.

130
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,588
Now at D your giving up even more,

131
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:11,116
and then you're giving up even more.

132
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,772
And so whenever you see a bow shaped curve like this,

133
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,888
so a curve that literally looks like this.

134
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,950
This shows that you have increasing opportunity cost:

135
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,854
as you increase more and more units,

136
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:25,077
you're going to have to give up more and more of the alternative.
