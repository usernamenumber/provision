1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,370
We know what a chemical equation
is and we've learned

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,530
how to balance it.

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,340
Now, we're ready to learn
about stoichiometry.

5
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,320
And this is an ultra fancy word
that often makes people

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,850
think it's difficult.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,640
But it's really just the study
or the calculation of the

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,310
relationships between
the different

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,530
molecules in a reaction.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,360
This is the actual definition
that Wikipedia gives,

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,790
stoichiometry is the calculation
of quantitative,

12
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,790
or measurable, relationships
of the

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,760
reactants and the products.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,980
And you're going to see in
chemistry, sometimes people

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,560
use the word reagents.

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,880
For most of our purposes you can
use the word reagents and

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,170
reactants interchangeably.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,340
They're both the reactants
in a reaction.

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,830
The reagents are sometimes for
special types of reactions

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,310
where you want to throw a
reagent in and see if

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,070
something happens.

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,980
And see if your belief about
that substance is true or

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,620
things like that.

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,100
But for our purposes
a reagent and

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,790
reactant is the same thing.

26
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,390
So it's a relationship between
the reactants and the products

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,050
in a balanced chemical
equation.

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,670
So if we're given an unbalanced
one, we know how to

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,735
get to the balanced point.

30
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,410
A balanced chemical equation.

31
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,200
So let's do some
stoichiometry.

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,720
   

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,660
Just so we get practice
balancing equations, I'm

34
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,860
always going to start with
unbalanced equations.

35
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,483
Let's say we have iron
three oxide.

36
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:21,570
   

37
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,590
Two iron atoms with three
oxygen atoms.

38
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,180
Plus aluminum, Al.

39
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:40,070
And it yields Al2
O3 plus iron.

40
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,200
So remember when we're doing
stoichiometry first of all, we

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,540
want to deal with balanced
equations.

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,250
A lot of stoichiometry problems
will give you a

43
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,030
balanced equation.

44
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,090
But I think it's good practice
to actually balance the

45
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,825
equations ourselves.

46
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:50,970
So let's try to balance
this one.

47
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,240
We have two iron atoms here
in this iron three oxide.

48
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,750
How many iron atoms do we have
on the right hand side?

49
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,570
We only have one.

50
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,430
So let's multiply this
by 2 right here.

51
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,920
All right, oxygen, we have
three on this side.

52
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,479
We have three oxygens
on that side.

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,740
That looks good.

54
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,480
Aluminum, on the left hand
side we only have

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,240
one aluminum atom.

56
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,540
On the right hand side we have
two aluminum atoms. So we have

57
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,700
to put a 2 here.

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,260
And we have balanced
this equation.

59
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,670
So now we're ready to do
some stoichiometry.

60
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,450
   

61
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,450
There's not just one type of
stoichiometry problem, but

62
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,550
they're all along the lines of,
if I give you x grams of

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,250
this how many grams of aluminum
do I need to make

64
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,320
this reaction happen?

65
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,480
Or if I give you y grams of this
molecule and z grams of

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,680
this molecule which one's
going to run out first?

67
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,610
That's all stoichiometry.

68
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,460
And we'll actually do those
exact two types of problems in

69
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,680
this video.

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:03:00,010
So let's say that we were given
85 grams of the iron

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,260
three oxide.

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,760
   

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
So my question to you
is how many grams of

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,370
aluminum do we need?

75
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,750
   

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,800
Well you look at the equation,
you immediately

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,150
see the mole ratio.

78
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,190
So for every mole of this, so
for every one atom we use of

79
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,840
iron three oxide we need
two aluminums.

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,390
So what we need to do is figure
out how many moles of

81
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,420
this molecule there are in 85
grams. And then we need to

82
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,930
have twice as many moles
of aluminum.

83
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,910
Because for every mole of the
iron three oxide, we have two

84
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,800
moles of aluminum.

85
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,750
And we're just looking at the
coefficients, we're just

86
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,850
looking at the numbers.

87
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,910
One molecule of iron three
oxide combines with two

88
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,750
molecule of aluminum to make
this reaction happen.

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,380
So lets first figure out how
many moles 85 grams are.

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,620
So what's the atomic mass
or the mass number

91
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,210
of this entire molecule?

92
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,620
Let me do it down here.

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,430
So we have two irons
and three oxygens.

94
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,220
So let me go down and figure out
the atomic masses of iron

95
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,610
and oxygen.

96
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,089
So iron is right here, 55.85.

97
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,420
I think it's fair enough
to round to 56.

98
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,770
Let's say we're dealing with
the version of iron, the

99
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,890
isotope of iron, that
has 30 neutrons.

100
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,990
So it has an atomic
mass number of 56.

101
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,810
So iron has 56 atomic
mass number.

102
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,500
And then oxygen, we already
know, is 16.

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,240
Iron was 56.

104
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:56,310
This mass is going to be 2
times 56 plus 3 times 16.

105
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,460
We can do that in our heads.

106
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,180
But this isn't a math
video, so I'll get

107
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,430
the calculator out.

108
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,690
   

109
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:16,760
2 times 56 plus 3 times
16 is equal to 160.

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,120
Is that right?

111
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
That's 48 plus 112,
right, 160.

112
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:29,450
So one molecule of iron three
oxide is going to be 160

113
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,410
atomic mass units.

114
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:41,620
So one mole or 6.02 times 10
to the 23 molecules of iron

115
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:55,800
oxide is going to have
a mass of 160 grams.

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,820
So in our reaction we said we're
starting off with 85

117
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,510
grams of iron oxide.

118
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,010
How many moles is that?

119
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:08,430
Well 85 grams of iron
three oxide is equal

120
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,510
to 85 over 160 moles.

121
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:21,240
So that's equal to, 85 divided
by 160 equals 0.53125.

122
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,200
Equals 0.53 moles.

123
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,730
So everything we've done so far
in this green and light

124
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,410
blue, we figured out how
many moles 85 grams of

125
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,530
iron three oxide is.

126
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,310
And we figured out
it's 0.53 moles.

127
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,320
Because a full mole would
have been 160 grams. But

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
we only have 85.

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,540
So it's point 0.53 moles.

130
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,890
And we know from this balanced
equation, that for every mole

131
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,780
of iron three oxide we
have, we need to have

132
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,100
two moles of aluminum.

133
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,340
So if we have 0.53 moles of the
iron molecule, iron three

134
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,540
oxide, then we're going to need
twice as many aluminum.

135
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,540
So we're going to need 1.06
moles of aluminum.

136
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,140
I just took 0.53 times 2.

137
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,510
Because the ratio is 1:2.

138
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,150
For every molecule of this, we
need two molecules of that.

139
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,810
So for every mole of this, we
need two moles of this.

140
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,210
If we have 0.53 moles, you
multiply that by 2, and you

141
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,360
have 1.06 moles of aluminum.

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,330
All right, so we just have to
figure out how many grams is a

143
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,240
mole of aluminum and then
multiply that times 1.06 and

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,280
we're done.

145
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,680
So aluminum, or aluminium as
some of our friends across the

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,700
pond might say.

147
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,400
Aluminium, actually
I enjoy that more.

148
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,070
Aluminium has the atomic
weight or the

149
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,800
weighted average is 26.98.

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,420
But let's just say that the
aluminium that we're dealing

151
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,120
with has a mass of 27
atomic mass units.

152
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
   

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,650
So one aluminum is 27
atomic mass units.

154
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:12,560
So one mole of aluminium is
going to be 27 grams. Or 6.02

155
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,295
times 10 to 23 aluminium atoms
is going to be 27 grams. So if

156
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:21,970
we need 1.06 moles, how many
is that going to be?

157
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:31,810
So 1.06 moles of aluminium is
equal to 1.06 times 27 grams.

158
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,060
And what is that?

159
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,210
   

160
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,090
1.06 times 27.

161
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,809
Equals 28.62.

162
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:51,330
So we need 28.62 grams of
aluminium, I won't write the

163
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,560
whole thing there, in order to
essentially use up our 85

164
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
grams of the iron three oxide.

165
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,570
And if we had more than 28.62
grams of aluminium, then

166
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,600
they'll be left over after
this reaction happens.

167
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,660
Assuming we keep mixing it
nicely and the whole reaction

168
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,540
happens all the way.

169
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,810
And we'll talk more about
that in the future.

170
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,950
And in that situation where we
have more than 28.63 grams of

171
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,620
aluminium, then this molecule
will be the limiting reagent.

172
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,710
Because we had more than enough
of this, so this is

173
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,100
what's going to limit
the amount of this

174
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,090
process from happening.

175
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,770
If we have less than 28.63 grams
of, I'll start saying

176
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,260
aluminum, then the aluminum will
be the limiting reagent,

177
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,500
because then we wouldn't be able
to use all the 85 grams

178
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,610
of our iron molecule, or our
iron three oxide molecule.

179
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,875
Anyway, I don't want to confuse
you in the end with

180
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,640
that limiting reagents.

181
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,400
In the next video, we'll do
a whole problem devoted to

182
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,030
limiting reagents.

183
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,667
