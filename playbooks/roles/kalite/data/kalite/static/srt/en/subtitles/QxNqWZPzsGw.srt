1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:09,540
We're standing in front of an unfinished painting by Leonardo da Vinci.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,120
It's a big painting, and interestingly almost a perfect square.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,903
It's really unfinished, not just some parts. 
It's really just the underpainting.

4
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:21,447
This is the Adoration of the Magi.

5
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,416
A moment in Christian story when Christ has just been born

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:29,590
and three kings from the east, 
guided by the star of Bethlehem, come to Mary

7
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,316
and offer Christ three gifts: frankincense, myrrh, and gold.

8
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:38,419
Which revealed to us here, is Leonardo's working method

9
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:43,149
Not only his brilliant drawing, 
but the way which he constructs figures.

10
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:49,346
Remember, that Leonardo is first and foremost not a painter, he's really a scientist, an engineer.

11
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:51,859
Somebody who looks and understands nature.

12
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,918
We sense Leonardo's deep understanding of human anatomy.

13
00:00:54,918 --> 00:01:02,326
When he paints clothed figures, he's understanding the skeletal structures, the musculature of the body

14
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:06,082
If you look to the group of figures to the right, 
about midlevel

15
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:11,283
you see a figure that almost looks like a skull, as if literally

16
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:17,666
Leonardo reconstructs the bones, before he put flesh on them, before he put clothes on them, before he adds colors.

17
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:21,145
That's a group of figures that often referred to as the philosophers.

18
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:23,849
But may be we should discuss the central group first.

19
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:31,412
We have Mary and the Christ child, front and center, forming a pyramid shape together with the Magi in front.

20
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:37,768
That's the shape that we see very often in paintings of the high Renaissance that provides a stable form.

21
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:41,535
You see that here in the foreground with Mary and Christ.

22
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:46,036
It is essentially important in this painting which is so chaotic, with so much going on.

23
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:48,591
At the upper right, there is a battle of 2 horses rearing up

24
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:54,317
at the upper left, a fragment of a classical architecture.

25
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:57,272
the wonderful steps and perfect linear perspective.

26
00:01:57,272 --> 00:02:01,201
Leonardo did a brilliant drawing in preparation of this painting.

27
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:05,748
But let's look more closely to define the pyramid lines.

28
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:09,410
Start with the Virgin Mary and look at her face.

29
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,078
She's glancing across the top of her son's head

30
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:19,465
down his arms, he 'picks up' her glance
and brings her eye down

31
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:22,372
until it is met by the Magi who's offering a gift.

32
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:26,738
Run the line down, past his toes, 
to the corner of the painting.

33
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:30,882
Or we can pick up from Mary and go the other way.

34
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:36,311
From the bridge of her nose, across her shoulders, 
picked up by the kneeling figure at the left.

35
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:41,969
Interestingly, it is not simply a triangle, 
but a pyramid that comes forward

36
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,807
as it moves down.

37
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:46,905
In the existing space, I'm struck by Leonardo's

38
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:52,322
attention to all of the human reactions to the situation.

39
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:57,179
A lot of faces, half hidden in the darkness,
and a lot of gestures.

40
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:03,376
It reminds me to the Leonardo's Last Supper, 
Christ in the middle forming the pyramid with

41
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:11,134
his outstretched arms, the chaos and reactions of the apostles. It brings a stability in the center.

42
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:16,632
It is a characteristic of the High Renaissance: 
a notion of balance, perfection, eternal..

43
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:20,878
and also how we as human reacts.

44
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,434
There is another important element here, 
a characteristic of Leonardo.

45
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:27,083
Even as an underpainting, we can identify it.

46
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:31,738
It is a technique of Sfumato, in Italian is "smoke".

47
00:03:31,738 --> 00:03:37,817
A visual glue that creates harmony
between forms within the paintings

48
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:42,152
brings things together and 
keeps the painting from the sense of isolation

49
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,762
which is the characteristic of the early Renaissance.

50
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:48,967
Instead of figures being defined by lines,

51
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,130
the figures are enveloped in atmospheric haze

52
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,879
or softness, smokiness.

53
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,897
It makes them to emerge out of the darkness into light, 
then fade back into the darkness again.

54
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,698
Leonardo unifies the figures in the pyramid composition

55
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:07,557
through their glances and gestures,

56
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,984
but also through that smoky atmosphere.

57
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,914
We see this beautiful smoke, beautiful lines,..

58
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:17,476
composition, complex sense of motion.

59
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:21,416
I would love to know how this painting looks like, 
had it been finished.

60
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,655
Me too.
