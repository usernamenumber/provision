1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,256
We're asked to simplify r to the
2/3 s to the third, that

3
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:05,370
whole thing squared.

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,050
Times the square root of 20r to
the fourth s to the fifth.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,040
Now this looks kind of daunting,
but I think if we

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,480
take it step by step it
shouldn't be too bad.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,100
So first we can look at this
first expression right here

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
where we're taking this product
to the second power.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,390
We know that instead we can take
each of the terms in the

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,410
product to the second power
and then take the product.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,240
So this is going to be the same
thing as r to the 2/3

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,560
squared times s to the
third squared.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,560
And now let's look at this
radical over here.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,690
We have the square root, but
that's the exact same thing as

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,030
raising something to
the 1/2 power.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,340
So this is equal to--
so times this part.

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,330
Let me do this in a
different color.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,090
This part right here, that
is the same thing as 20.

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,540
And instead of just writing
20, let me write 20 as the

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,210
product of a perfect square
and a non-perfect square.

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,230
So 20 is the same thing
as 4 times 5.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,990
That's the 20 part.

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,250
Times r to the fourth times
s to the fifth.

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,750
Now let me write s to the fifth
also as a product of a

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,510
perfect square and a
non-perfect square.

26
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,440
r to the fourth is obviously
a perfect square.

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,080
Its square root is r squared.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,840
But let's write s to the
fifth in a similar way.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,830
So s to the fifth we can
rewrite as s to the

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,150
fourth times s.

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,280
Right?

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,010
S to the fourth times s to the
first, that is s to the fifth.

33
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,480
And of course, all of this has
to be raised to the 1/2 power.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,720
Now let's simplify
this even more.

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,790
If we're taking something to the
2/3 power and then to the

36
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,290
second power, we can just
multiply the exponents.

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,030
So this term right here,
we can simplify this as

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,420
r to the 4/3 power.

39
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,560
And just as a bit of review,
taking something to the 4/3

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,910
power, you can view it as either
taking-- finding its

41
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,790
cube root, taking it to the 1/3
power, and then taking its

42
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,470
cube root to the fourth power.

43
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,130
Or you can view it as taking
it to the fourth power and

44
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,070
then finding the cube
root of that.

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,090
Those are both legitimate ways
of something being raised to

46
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,210
the 4/3 power.

47
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,840
So you have r to the 4/3 times
s to the 3 times 2.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,990
Times s to the sixth power.

49
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,130
And then we could raise each of
these terms right here to

50
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,720
the 1/2 power.

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,685
So times-- let me color
code it a little bit.

52
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:23,630
And we actually wouldn't
need the

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,750
parentheses once we do that.

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:33,800
Times 4 to the 1/2 times
5 to the 1/2.

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,520
That term right there.

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,920
Times r to the fourth
to the 1/2 power.

57
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,620
Times-- I might run out of
colors-- s to the fourth to

58
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,870
the 1/2 power.

59
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,680
   

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,670
We're raising each of these
terms to that 1/2 power.

61
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,380
Times s to the 1/2 power.

62
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,990
There's a lot of ways we can
go with this, but the one

63
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,800
thing that might jump out is
that there are some perfect

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
squares here and we're raising
them to the 1/2 power.

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,170
We're taking their
square roots, so

66
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,800
let's simplify those.

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,890
So this 4 to the 1/2, that's
the same thing as 2.

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,550
We're taking the principal
root of 4.

69
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,770
5 to the 1/2?

70
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,050
Well, we can't take the square
root of that, so let's just

71
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,385
write that as the square
root of 5.

72
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:21,210
   

73
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,780
r to the fourth to the 1/2.

74
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,900
There's two ways you
can think about it.

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,330
4 times 1/2 is 2.

76
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,590
So this is r squared.

77
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,140
Or you could say the
square root of r to

78
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,800
the fourth is r squared.

79
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,760
So this is r squared.

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,270
Similarly, the square root of
s to the fourth or s to the

81
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,780
1/2 is also s squared.

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,900
And then this s to the 1/2,
let's just write that as the

83
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,490
square root of s.

84
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,370
   

85
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,380
Just like that.

86
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,900
Let's see what else
we can do here.

87
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,030
Let me write these other terms.
We have an r to the 4/3

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,830
times s to the sixth times 2
times square root of 5 times r

89
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,840
squared times s squared times
the square root of s.

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,800
Now, a couple of things
we can do here.

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,490
We could combine these s
terms. Let's do that.

92
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,230
Actually, just write the 2 out
front first. So let's write

93
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,910
the 2 out front first.
So you have 2 times.

94
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,990
Now let's look at these
two s terms over here.

95
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,770
We have s to the sixth
times s squared.

96
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,500
When someone says to simplify
it, there's multiple

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,560
interpretations for it.

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,650
But we'll just say s to the
sixth times s squared.

99
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,840
That's s to the eighth.

100
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
6 plus 2.

101
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,290
Times s to the eighth power.

102
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,800
Times-- now this one's
interesting and we might want

103
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
to break it up depending on what
we consider to be truly

104
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,630
simplified.

105
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,516
We have r to the 4/3
times r squared.

106
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:52,110
   

107
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,440
r to the 4/3 is the same thing
as r to the 1 and 1/3.

108
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
That's what 4/3 is.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,750
So 1 and 1/3 plus
2 is 3 and 1/3.

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,520
So we could write this times
r to the 3 and 1/3.

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,840
That's a little inconsistent.

112
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,460
Over here I'm adding
a fraction.

113
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,850
Over here with the s I kind of
left out the s to the 1/2 from

114
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,545
the s's here.

115
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,840
But we could play around with
it and all of those would be

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,660
valid expressions.

117
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,050
So we've already dealt
with the 2.

118
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,960
We've already dealt with
these two s's.

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,190
We've already dealt
with these r's.

120
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,020
And then you have the square
root of 5 times the

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,770
square root of s.

122
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,070
And we could merge them
if we want, but I

123
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,610
won't do it just yet.

124
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:34,790
Times the square root of 5 times
the square root of s.

125
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,170
Now there's two ways
we could do it.

126
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,650
We might not like having a
fractional exponent here.

127
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,840
And then we could
break it out.

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,430
Or we might want to take this
guy and merge it with the

129
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,410
eighth power.

130
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,440
Because you know that
this is the same

131
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
thing as s to the 1/2.

132
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,300
So let's do it both ways.

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,380
So if we wanted to merge all
of the exponents, we could

134
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,900
write this as 2 times s to the
eighth times s to the 1/2.

135
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,300
So s to the eighth
and s to the 1/2.

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,430
That would be 2 times s
to the 8-- I can even

137
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,410
write it as a decimal.

138
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,480
8.5.

139
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,850
8 plus-- you could imagine this
is s to the 0.5 power.

140
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,630
So that's 8.5 times r
to the 3 and 1/3.

141
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,260
I'm kind of mixing
notations here.

142
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,740
I have just a decimal notation,
then I have a

143
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,910
fraction notation, mixed
number notation.

144
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,350
Times the square root of 5.

145
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,700
This is one simplification.

146
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,140
I kind of have it in the
fewest terms possible.

147
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,420
The other simplification if you
don't want to have these

148
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,170
fractional exponents out here,
you could write it as-- I'll

149
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,840
do this in a different color.

150
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,790
You could write this-- and
these are all equivalent

151
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,330
statements.

152
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,050
So it's up to debate what
simplified really means.

153
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,270
So you could write this as
2 times s to the eighth.

154
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,950
Instead of writing r to the 3
and 1/3, we could write r to

155
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,870
the third times the cube root of
r, which is the same thing

156
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,720
as r to the 1/3.

157
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,250
We could write r to the third
times r to the 1/3.

158
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,000
r to the 1/3 is the same thing
as the cube root of r.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,730
And then you have the square
root of these two guys.

160
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,390
Both of these guys are being
raised to the 1/2 power.

161
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,830
So you could then say times
the square root of 5s.

162
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,300
I like this one a little bit
more, the one on the left.

163
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,070
To me this is really
simplified.

164
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,030
We've merged all of the bases.

165
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,190
We have these two numbers, we've
merged all the s terms,

166
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,370
all the r terms. This is a
little bit more complicated.

167
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,200
You have a cube root.

168
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,130
You haven't separated
the s's and the r's.

169
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,870
So I would go with this one if
someone really wanted me--

170
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,680
said hey, Sal, simplify
it how you like.

171
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,200
