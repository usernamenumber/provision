1
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:06,109
- We're standing in the marvelous

2
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:07,592
new museum that was designed

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,143
by Richard Meier to hold

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,709
the Ara Pacis.

5
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:11,659
One of the most important

6
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,176
monuments from Augustan Rome.

7
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:17,276
- Ara Pacis means Altar of Peace.

8
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:20,843
Augustus was the first emperor of Rome.

9
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:24,560
- And the person who established the Pax Romana

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,459
that is the Roman Peace.

11
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,792
The event that prompted

12
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,643
the building of this altar to peace,

13
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:32,608
under Augustus, was Augustus'

14
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:35,109
triumphal return from military

15
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:38,209
campaigns in what is now Spain and France.

16
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,859
- And when he returned, the senate

17
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,059
vowed to create an altar commemorating

18
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,526
the peace that he established in the Empire.

19
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:49,943
And apparently on July 4th in the year 13

20
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:52,377
the sacred precinct was marked out

21
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:54,810
on which the altar itself would be built.

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,227
It's really kind of wonderful

23
00:00:56,227 --> 00:01:00,059
because today it's July 4th, 2012.

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,810
- Now we're talking about the Ara Pacis

25
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,292
but of course this has been reconstructed

26
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,326
from many, many fragments that were discovered

27
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:11,709
some in the 17th century, mostly

28
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:13,609
in the 20th century.

29
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:14,977
- Actually it's a small miracle that

30
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:16,909
we've been able to reconstruct this at all

31
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,609
it had been lost to memory.

32
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,276
- The remains of it lay under someone's palace

33
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:25,076
when it was recognized what these fragments

34
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:27,126
were it because really important to

35
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:29,176
excavate them and to reconstruct the altar.

36
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,292
- That was finally done under Mussolini,

37
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,826
the fascist leader in the years leading up

38
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,477
to the second world war and during the

39
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:36,726
second world war.

40
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,810
And that was important to Mussolini

41
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,209
because Mussolini identified himself with Augustus,

42
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:43,692
the first emperor of Rome.

43
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:46,077
Mussolini was very much trying to reestablish

44
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:48,359
a kind of Italian empire.

45
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,492
We should talk a little bit about what an altar is.

46
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,092
- Sure, when we talk about the Altar

47
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,859
really what we are looking at is the walls of

48
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,009
the precinct around what is in the middle

49
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,809
of the Altar where sacrifices would have occurred.

50
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,327
- The Altar itself is interesting and important when

51
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:03,760
we think about Augustus.

52
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,492
Augustus is establishing a centralized

53
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:07,676
power.

54
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:10,526
Rome had been since its earliest founding years

55
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,343
when it was under the rule of kings,

56
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:13,959
it had been controlled by the senate.

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,060
It had been a republic.

58
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,376
- That's right. And a senate was basically

59
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:22,027
a group of the leading elder citizens of Rome.

60
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:24,609
So Rome was a republic and it really was

61
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,859
a republic until Julius Caesar, who was

62
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,759
the dictator and Augustus' uncle.

63
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,143
And then Caesar is assassinated,

64
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:34,010
there's civil war, and then

65
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,042
peace is established by Augustus.

66
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,760
- Right. Augustus, whose real name was Octavian,

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,577
was given the term Augustus as a kind of

68
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:45,143
honorific as a way of representing his power.

69
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:47,609
And it's interesting the kind of politics that

70
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,643
Augustus involved himself with.

71
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:52,210
He gave great power back to the senate,

72
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,242
but by doing so he established real and central

73
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,159
authority for himself.

74
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,043
- He made himself princeps, or

75
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,676
first among equals. But of course,

76
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:04,425
he controlled everything.

77
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:06,842
- He also held the title of Pontificus Maximus,

78
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,659
that is the head priest of the state religion

79
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,759
and so he held tremendous power.

80
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,709
- Now don't forget too, that his uncle,

81
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,664
Julius Caesar, had been made a god,

82
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,978
and so he also represented himself

83
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,988
as the son of a god.

84
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,242
- And so the idea of establishing this altar

85
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:29,692
has a political as well as spiritual significance.

86
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,959
- He's looking back to the golden age

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,813
of Greece, of the 5th century B.C.,

88
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:38,258
but he's also looking back to the Roman Republic.

89
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:41,193
He's reestablishing some of the ancient rituals

90
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:43,609
of traditional roman religion.

91
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,810
He's embracing traditional Roman values.

92
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,775
- But even as he's doing that,

93
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,842
he's remaking Rome radically.

94
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:52,859
He's changing Rome from a city of brick

95
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,610
to a city of marble, and the Ara Pacis

96
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,109
is a spectacular example of that.

97
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,587
- And when we look closely at the Ara Pacis

98
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,623
what we're gonna see is that this

99
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:05,909
speaks to the sense of a "Golden Age" that

100
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:09,081
Augustus brought about in the Roman Empire.

101
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,692
- One of the most remarkable elements

102
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:14,876
of the Ara Pacis is all of the highly decorative

103
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:18,076
relief carving in the lower frieze.

104
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,259
- And that goes all the way around

105
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,176
it apparently shows more than 50 different

106
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,742
species of plants; they're very

107
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:29,042
natural in that we can identify these species

108
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,093
but they're also highly abstracted

109
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:33,685
and they form these beautiful, symmetrical,

110
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:35,624
and linear patterns.

111
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:37,851
- There is a real order that's given to the

112
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,752
complexity of nature here.

113
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:41,802
Let me just describe quickly what I'm seeing:

114
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,052
this massive, elegant acanthis leaf

115
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:45,484
which is a native plant,

116
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,218
which were made famous in Corinthian capitols.

117
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,985
And almost like a candelabra,

118
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,517
growing up from it,

119
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,685
we see these tendrils of all kinds of plants

120
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,000
that spiral.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,218
- And there're also animal forms

122
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,317
within these leaves and plants,

123
00:04:59,317 --> 00:05:02,517
we find frogs and lizards and birds.

124
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,084
- And the carving is quite deep,

125
00:05:04,084 --> 00:05:06,052
so that there's this sharp contrast between

126
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,934
the brilliance of the external marble and

127
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,635
then the shadows that are cast.

128
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:11,701
It seems to lift off the surface.

129
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,701
- And art historians interpret all this

130
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,517
as a symbol of fertility,

131
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:19,185
of the abundance of the Golden Age

132
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,067
that Augustus brought about.

133
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,984
- We also see that same pattern

134
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:24,636
repeated in the plasters

135
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,434
that frame these panels.

136
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,385
And then we also have meander,

137
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:30,184
that moves horizontally around

138
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,885
the entire exterior.

139
00:05:31,885 --> 00:05:33,934
And it's above that meander that we see

140
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,435
the narrative friezes.

141
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,584
- These panels relate, again, to this Golden Age

142
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:41,651
that Augustus establishes.

143
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,017
These refer back to Aeneas, Rome's founder,

144
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:48,451
and Augustus' ancestor.

145
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,601
We see other allegorical figures

146
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,500
representing Rome and peace.

147
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,368
- We have to be a little bit careful

148
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,684
when we try to characterize what

149
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:57,451
precisely is being represented.

150
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,469
There are lots of conflicting interpretations.

151
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,334
- And these allegorical or mythological scenes

152
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:04,734
appear on the front and back of the altar,

153
00:06:04,734 --> 00:06:07,001
and then on the sides of the altar

154
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,667
we see a procession.

155
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,468
- We've walked around the outer wall,

156
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:12,200
and we're now looking at

157
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,567
a panel that's actually

158
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,151
in quite good condition.

159
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,635
But that doesn't mean

160
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:18,035
we really know what's going on.

161
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,534
- No, there's a lot of argument

162
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,651
about what the figure in the center

163
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,017
represents.

164
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,534
Some art historians think this

165
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:26,234
figure represents Venus.

166
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,003
Some think it represents the figure of peace,

167
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:31,971
some the figure or Tellus, or Mother Earth.

168
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,168
In any case, she is clearly

169
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,884
a figure that suggests fertility

170
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:37,950
and abundance.

171
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,916
- She's beautifully rendered;

172
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,719
look at the way the drapery clings

173
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,567
to her torso so closely

174
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,034
as to really reveal the flesh underneath,

175
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:47,386
like the goddesses on the Parthenon

176
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:48,701
on the Acropolis in Greece.

177
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,834
- And on her lap sit two children,

178
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:52,434
one of whom offers her some fruit.

179
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,084
There's fruit on her lap.

180
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,886
On either side of her sit two

181
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,951
mythological figures who

182
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,901
art historians think represent the

183
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:02,866
winds of the Earth and the sea.

184
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:04,600
- Well, look at the way the drapes

185
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,867
that they're holding whip up,

186
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:06,984
creating these beautiful,

187
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:09,335
almost halos around their bodies.

188
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,568
- And at her feet,

189
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:12,267
we see an ox and sheep,

190
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,885
so there's a sense of harmony,

191
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:18,219
of peace and fertility.

192
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,985
- And that must have been such

193
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:22,018
a rare thing in the ancient world.

194
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:24,367
- Well, Augustus reigns after decades

195
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,218
of civil war, after the assassination

196
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,517
of Julius Caesar.

197
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:30,785
So I think there's a powerful sense

198
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,167
that this was the Golden Age.

199
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,885
- So let's walk to the sides now

200
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:38,201
and take a look at the procession.

201
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,501
The frieze moves from the

202
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,302
back wall of the precinct,

203
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:45,517
up towards the very front, on both sides.

204
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:47,802
And the figures are also facing

205
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,035
towards the main staircase.

206
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,101
- Art historians are not really clear what

207
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,555
event is being depicted here--

208
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,019
- Art historians aren't clear

209
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,324
about any of this, are we?

210
00:07:57,324 --> 00:07:58,464
- No. [laughter]

211
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:59,398
Uh, there are a couple of

212
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:00,809
posibilities that have been raised.

213
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,642
One is that what we're seeing is

214
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,539
the procession that would have taken place

215
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,802
at the time the altar was inaugurated.

216
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,718
The figures that we see here are priests,

217
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,553
and we can identify those figures

218
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:14,717
because of the veils on their heads.

219
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:16,885
And there also seem to be members

220
00:08:16,885 --> 00:08:18,734
of Augustus' family,

221
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,334
although their identities are not

222
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,334
quite firmly established.

223
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,517
- We think we know which figure

224
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,917
is Augustus, although the marble

225
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,435
itself is not in especially

226
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:29,834
good condition, and we've lost

227
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,552
the front of his body.

228
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,417
And we also think we can identify

229
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:36,303
one of his most important ministers.

230
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,718
- And that would be Agrippa.

231
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,451
If we think about this as looking back

232
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,484
to the frieze on the parthenon

233
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:43,636
from the Golden Age of Greece,

234
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:46,117
those figures are all ideally beautiful,

235
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,552
they don't represent anyone specific

236
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:51,567
so much as the Athenian people, generally.

237
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,117
- But these are portraits.

238
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,484
- That's right, and we can't

239
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,067
always identify them for certain,

240
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,368
but they really are specific individuals

241
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:00,834
on a specific date,

242
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,167
taking part in a specific event.

243
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,734
- It's interesting to think about it

244
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:05,985
because of course, throughout the

245
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:07,568
Republic, portraiture in stone

246
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,000
was something the Romans

247
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,451
were extremely good at.

248
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:11,617
And so it doesn't surprise

249
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,802
me that they would not

250
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,051
look to the idealized, so mush as

251
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,501
look to the specific.

252
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,317
- We also notice those differences

253
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:19,802
in the depth of the carving;

254
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,302
some figures are represented

255
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:23,352
in high relief, other figures that

256
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,202
are supposed to be in the background

257
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,734
are represented in low relief.

258
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,102
So there's a real illusion of

259
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,352
space and of a crowd here

260
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,485
at the procession.

261
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,168
- Another way that the specificity

262
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,700
of the Romans is expressed, is

263
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,617
through the inclusion of children.

264
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,584
This is a sacred event,

265
00:09:37,584 --> 00:09:39,218
and a formal event,

266
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,567
and yet there are children

267
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,219
doing what children do;

268
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,401
that is to say they're not

269
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:44,684
always paying attention.

270
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,303
- There are a couple of interpretations

271
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,302
that have been offered about

272
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,584
the presence of children here.

273
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,251
Augustus was actually worried about

274
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,783
the birth rate and passed laws

275
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,585
that encouraged marriage and

276
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,784
the birth of children.

277
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:57,617
It originally was painted –

278
00:09:57,617 --> 00:09:59,067
we would have seen pinks and

279
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,584
blues and greens – and

280
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,367
it's very difficult to imagine that when

281
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,918
we look at the marble today.

282
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:05,202
- Well, it's true. Especially in

283
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,469
Meier's building which is

284
00:10:06,469 --> 00:10:07,817
so stark and modern,

285
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,117
it's almost a little garish

286
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:11,017
to imagine how brightly

287
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,733
painted this would have been –

288
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,001
they were pretty bright!

289
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,417
- They were. So one of the

290
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:16,585
things that Augustus said of

291
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:18,053
himself was that he found

292
00:10:18,053 --> 00:10:20,802
Rome a city of brick, and he left it

293
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,334
a city of marble.

294
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,117
Augustus created an imperial city,

295
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:28,034
and here we are 2000 years later

296
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,737
in the Rome that Augustus created.
