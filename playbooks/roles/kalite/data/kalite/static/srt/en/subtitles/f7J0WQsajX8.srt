1
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:06,932
We are in the British Museum

2
00:00:06,963 --> 00:00:10,465
looking at a large ivory panel

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,303
usually ivories are very

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,222
small.

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,524
This is huge and apparently it's actually

6
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:17,767
one-half of a diptych, whats interesteing is that

7
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,091
even though it is in the British Museum it is

8
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:24,453
originally comes from Constantinople so this is a Byzantine object

9
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:26,742
It looks like the other half of the diptych

10
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:29,180
would have been on the left side

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,585
the angel who is in this ivory, let me just say this

12
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:34,172
the ivory is probably about 18 inches?

13
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:37,322
Yeah, I would say so. Probably about 5 and a half or six.

14
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:39,802
Right, the other panel would have been on the left

15
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:42,233
and the Archangel would have been looking

16
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,071
in the direction of what would have been the other

17
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,604
figure in the other panel.

18
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,503
And you can further tell that the panel would have been on the left because you can actually see

19
00:00:49,503 --> 00:00:52,501
through the holes that would have been functioning as part of the hinge.

20
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,464
Right, and the deptic of course

21
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:58,227
means the work of art made out of two panels as opposed to a triptych

22
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,773
which is three panels.

23
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,339
We can assume that there would have been another saint on the other side

24
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,331
another Angel perhaps.

25
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,409
Another angel or, perhaps the Angel giving this

26
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,279
orb to a king or an emperor.

27
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:13,932
So we see Greek text up at the top and below that we see this incredibly ornate arch

28
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,234
with a cross above that and the cross is surmounting an orb

29
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,558
there seems to be almost kind of a sunburst

30
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:23,460
behind it, very decorative beautiful carving of a kind of

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,582
ribbon or banner just below the reef and then some

32
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:31,667
broad open areas under some dentals these are just Architectural elements

33
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,450
we see Corinthian pilasters framing the figure.

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,947
It actually reminded me of an apse in a church with a archway behind

35
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:43,153
those columns and may be perhaps the kind of recessed space.

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,386
Even though this is carved in such a shallow relief carving

37
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,641
it's so flat

38
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,062
You do get the sense of real architectural space there

39
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,227
and then the figure himself is so interesting

40
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,665
because it's so classicizing in some ways

41
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:59,909
This is though very much a byzantine rendering, look at the

42
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,335
size of the archangel in relationship, for instance, to the staircase.

43
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:08,228
He is very large so to me, yes he very much takes up

44
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,654
that also faces of kind of hierarchy of scale

45
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,170
so that his size matters his divine nature.

46
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,896
So this is interesting because this is

47
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,352
very classicizing, look at the drapery

48
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:20,426
Yeah, it's very classical

49
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:24,091
he wears even up against the wings of, you know he is an Angel

50
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:25,138
he is an Archangel and...

51
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:27,217
but he has this classical toga on.

52
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:30,379
Yes, and it's actually getting fairly late

53
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,849
to see that kind of synthesis, right?

54
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,761
Even his hair, the curls in his hair look like a Roman sculture

55
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:40,021
It's true, if you stripped away the wings

56
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,775
if you stripped away the cross and the orb

57
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,730
you could be looking at a kind of a roman potrait.

58
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:47,689
The detail here in the carving is remarkable

59
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:51,063
the lines that make up each of the feathers

60
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:54,185
in the angel's wings or the little

61
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:57,543
circular swirling decorations in his cuff,

62
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,938
the delicacy of his hand as he holds the staff

63
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,733
the other hand holding the orb with the cross on it

64
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:06,937
the symbol of power but we know that

65
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,654
we are not in the classical world anymore

66
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:11,253
the way that I know that is by

67
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,702
not only his size in relationship to the Architecture

68
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:16,515
but when I look down at his feet.

69
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:17,132
Aah, how so?

70
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:19,231
You know, he doesnt

71
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:22,567
really stand on the ground, his feet sort of flatted out

72
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:24,707
and hang over the stairs

73
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,170
he doesn't really make contact with the ground in a meaningful way

74
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,351
and that suggests to me a kind of weightlessness

75
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:34,495
a kind of spirituality that reminds me of byzantine and

76
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,063
medieval art.

77
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,765
The handling of the body, which by the way really

78
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,762
is transparent behind the cloth

79
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:44,981
you know the body really does swell that cloth

80
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,030
it's not that later medieval rejection of the body below

81
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,915
but this is still coming out of the classical

82
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,074
Look at his toes.

83
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,493
They are great toes!

84
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:53,230
Aren't they?

85
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,198
They are great.

86
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:57,475
I mean this is such a strange combination

87
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,532
of the spiritual and the human that is

88
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:05,089
a very funny moment in early christian and byzantine art

89
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,308
There is a kind of awkwardness

90
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:09,820
with the synthesis it hasn't been worked out yet

91
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,245
It really is a clash of traditions

92
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:12,657
of Pagan and Christian

93
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:13,610
Absolutely.
