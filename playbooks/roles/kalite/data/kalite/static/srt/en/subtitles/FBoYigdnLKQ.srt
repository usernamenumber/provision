1
00:00:01,658 --> 00:00:05,935
Let's talk about hypertension, I'll write that here: hypertension

2
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:11,505
And hypertension basically means high blood pressure

3
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:19,541
and we actually categorize it in different groups. So let's use my blood pressureof 115/75 as an example

4
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,597
And I had drawn thisfigure for where where I had blood pressure on this side

5
00:00:20,597 --> 00:00:28,710
and I had time on this side.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,401
And I said my blood pressure does something like that

7
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,424
where the peak is 115

8
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:36,082
this is the systolic blood pressure

9
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:41,337
and I said that the lowest point is 75.

10
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:43,437
And that was my diastolic blood pressure.

11
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:50,352
We know that everyone has a different blood pressure, so let's organize blood pressure

12
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:54,069
into groups. let's say what group goes where

13
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:56,742
so to do that I'm gonna draw a couple number lines.

14
00:00:56,742 --> 00:01:00,477
So I have here in brown, I'll do my systolic blood pressure

15
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:05,890
on this side and I'll do the diastolic on the other side.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,778
And we're going to actually put them next to eachother

17
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:15,782
and I'll try to make them about the same size

18
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,855
like that. So let's say this is really high pressure

19
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:24,643
This would be like 200, and this is all in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

20
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:30,847
200 mmHg. and at the very bottom would be zero.

21
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:31,473
So let's make them kind of the same.

22
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:37,028
And that means that up here would be about 100

23
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:39,834
and this would be about 120, this about 140,

24
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:51,702
let's say this is maybe 160, and this is 180.

25
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:55,463
And I'm gonna do the same thing here, this is about 100.

26
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:59,444
Except I'm gonna go on the other side.

27
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:04,423
Let's say this is about 80, and this is 60, 40, 20

28
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:10,552
Maybe I didn't draw it as well, but I think you get the idea.

29
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:15,593
So this is my number line, and the reason I drew the systolic numbers higher

30
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:22,196
than the diastolic is that we know the systolic pressure is always going to be higher than the diastolic pressure.

31
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:25,844
So that is why I separated it out. But you can imagine that

32
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:28,499
these numbers go up and these go down

33
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,186
I'm just being lazy and not drawing it all out.

34
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:35,120
So let's say that my pressure is 115, this is my systolic pressure.

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,112
let's do that one first. Where does that fit?

36
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:41,811
Well on this number line, 115 would be about right here.

37
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:48,060
And actually anything below 120 is kind of in the green zone

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,596
and this goes all the way down to zero

39
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:57,412
So let's say my systolic was 97 or 103, that would all be in the green zone.

40
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:03,576
And what I mean by that is I would say that I do not have hypertension.

41
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:08,068
So that's kind of a nice, safe area to have your blood pressure in terms of hypertension.

42
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:12,413
Now for diastolic pressures, we know that diastolic pressures are

43
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,263
the low range of a blood pressure.

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,141
And so those numbers are going to be lower.

45
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:23,277
Here, anything below 80 is considered in that green zone

46
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:27,343
Below 80 is where you want to be.

47
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:30,518
And I want to be very specific, I don't mean to say that

48
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:33,383
a blood pressure of 5 would be good.

49
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,642
What I mean is that you don't have hypertension, so you don't have HIGH blood pressure.

50
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:41,013
And that's very different from having low blood pressure.

51
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:44,943
So just for right now the green zone in terms of high blood pressure.

52
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:48,351
Now let's say my systolic blood pressure was a little bit higher

53
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:52,276
say it's between 120 and 140, somewhere in here

54
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:56,898
then I'm in the yellow zone, and that yellow zone means that

55
00:03:56,898 --> 00:04:00,399
I don't have hypertension, but I'm getting there, so I'm getting closer

56
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:03,206
and this would be "Pre-hypertension"

57
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:07,926
On the other side, on the diastolic side, we use 90 as a cut-off

58
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:12,148
I'll write in 90, and anything between 80 and 90 would be

59
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:17,179
kind of in that yellow zone, and that's your pre-hypertension zone

60
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:21,063
That's pre-hypertension, so you're still not there yet.

61
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:24,832
Now in terms of high blood pressures, again you don't want high blood pressures

62
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:28,185
but in terms of getting there, if you're above 140

63
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,792
you're in hypertension, this zone right here

64
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:35,977
140-160 in particular is considered stage 1 hypertension

65
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:46,211
and between 90-100 for diastolic is stage 1.

66
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:53,282
And now if you have something above 160 for systolic blood pressure

67
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:58,750
Above 160, even higher than 200, so let's say you have 201,

68
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,936
that'd be stage 2.

69
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:06,980
So you can see that the higher you go, the higher your stage number

70
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,304
and the same is true on this side(diastolic).

71
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:13,570
So let's say you have a really high diastolic, well above 100,

72
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,729
you'd have stage 2 hypertension

73
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,899
all the way down there, so this is stage 2.

74
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:26,416
So i'm just gonig to do a couple quick examples for you.

75
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:30,215
So let's say, I'll do them in yellow (different color).

76
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:41,939
So let's say that you have 145 as a systolic and your diastolic is, let's say, 87.

77
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:49,351
Well 145 is right here, and 87 (I'm gonna do it in the same color to be consistent)

78
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:57,286
145 is right here, and 87 is in here.

79
00:05:57,286 --> 00:06:05,089
So you're systolic is stage 1 hypertension, and your diastolic is in pre-hypertension.

80
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:10,052
So when you're in different stages for the diastolic and the systolic, what you do,

81
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:14,265
the rule is that you go with the higher stage.

82
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:21,047
So in this case, stage 1 is higher, so this person would be considered stage 1 hypertension.

83
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,332
Now we can do one more example, just to make sure you get it.

84
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:27,618
So let's do a different color, I'll do the next one in red.

85
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:36,099
So let's say you have 126 over 101.

86
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:45,241
So this person, 126 is actually right here, and 101 is right above the 100 mark right there.

87
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:51,184
So this person is actually pre-hypertensive if you're looking at just your systolic value,

88
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:56,765
but they're actually in stage 2 hypertension if you're looking at their diastolic value.

89
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:00,777
So overall, they're going to be in stage 2.

90
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:04,794
Becaseu the rule, again, is that you go with the higher stage.

91
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:08,794
So that's how you figure out what stage of hypertension someone is in.
