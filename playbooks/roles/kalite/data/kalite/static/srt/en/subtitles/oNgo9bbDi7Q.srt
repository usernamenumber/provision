1
00:00:00,577 --> 00:00:05,165
You'll hear the terms , Balanced Forces and Unbalanced Forces a lot when you're dealing with Physics

2
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:10,870
and what I wanna do in this video is give you a bunch of scenarios and have you think about whether the forces in these scenarios

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,955
are balanced or unbalanced.

4
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,343
So let's start with the scenario where we have the ground.

5
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:20,803
And then sitting on the ground we have a rock.

6
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:26,614
Now the force of gravity is going to be pulling the rock downwards towards the center of the earth

7
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:30,053
and it's going to be pulling it, as essentially the weight of the rock,

8
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:36,519
it's going to be pulling it downwards , let's say with a force of 5 N downwards.

9
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,883
But then the rock is being supported by the ground,

10
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:42,219
the ground is keeping it from being plummeted downward.

11
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:48,336
So the ground is providing an upwards force or normal force in this situation.

12
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:51,285
The ground is providing a normal force, I'll do it in green.

13
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:55,657
The ground is providing a normal force in this situation .

14
00:00:56,543 --> 00:01:00,818
So these forces have the same magnitudes but they're going in opposite directions.

15
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:03,040
So that is the first scenario.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,841
Now let's think about another scenario.

17
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,690
So I'll draw the rock again.

18
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:16,952
We'll assume it's the same rock.
The force of gravity is still downwards.

19
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,259
5 N downwards.

20
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,563
And there's still a normal force , the ground supporting the rock of 5 N upwards.

21
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:31,047
5 N upwards.

22
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,822
And now there's some character who's trying to push the rock.

23
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:50,258
So we have some character here and he's trying to push the rock and he's applying a force of 2 N to the right.

24
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:55,838
But then there's a force of friction between the rock and the ground that is going 2...

25
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:58,475
I'll do friction in orange

26
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,623
2 N to the left

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:10,353
So that right over there is the force of friction. It's going against that guy's pushing.

28
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:14,246
Now let's do another scenario. Once again a very similar scenario.

29
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:21,856
Let's draw another scenario where I have a rock now. Maybe the same rock.

30
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:26,255
And here I have a 5 N force downwards.

31
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:29,459
Force of gravity, like the rest of the scenarios.

32
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:37,339
And I have the normal force. The rock is being supported by the ground 5 N upwards.

33
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:42,124
And this guy over here has been able to push a little bit harder.

34
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:47,362
He's pushing a little bit harder. He really put his back into it.

35
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:52,479
And now he's pushing with a force of 3 N to the right

36
00:02:52,479 --> 00:03:03,909
and the force of friction is still 2 N to the left. So that right over there is the force of friction.

37
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,689
Now let's do a couple of more scenarios.

38
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:15,048
Now let's imagine that this is the ground . And I have the rock. The rock is not resting on the ground.

39
00:03:15,048 --> 00:03:18,475
So the only force I have acting on the rock right now

40
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:21,612
is the force of gravity, acting downward.

41
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:24,197
We're assuming we're not going to think too much about--

42
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:25,928
Actually let's think about it a little bit, let's also

43
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:29,809
put, so let's put it...so I have the force of gravity.

44
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,710
That's 5 N down. But I have some air resistance here. You can view it as the

45
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:40,582
force of friction of the air, and let's say that is 1 N up.

46
00:03:42,197 --> 00:03:48,299
This is the force of friction or you can call it air resistance.

47
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,144
As if this thing bumps into all of the air particles as it

48
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,974
is falling to the ground.

49
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:58,891
The last scenario I'll draw with the rock again as that seems to be the

50
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:01,028
theme of the video.

51
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:03,074
The last scenario, that's the ground.

52
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:09,228
The rock is resting on the ground.

53
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,796
The rock is resting on the ground.

54
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:19,569
So I have the force of gravity, 5 N downwards.

55
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:26,271
The rock is being supported by the ground, 5 N upwards.

56
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:34,000
And now this guy is pushing really hard.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,087
So now he's applying 4 N

58
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:41,739
in that direction.

59
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:47,398
You have 2 N from the force of friction, I won't that draw just yet; and you also have

60
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:51,093
another character right over here, who is trying to keep this guy from pushing the

61
00:04:51,093 --> 00:04:57,000
rock. So he's pushing in the other direction at 1 N.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,803
So you have 2 N of the force of friction. You have this guy pushing 1 N against

63
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:12,688
this guy's motion to the left, so between this guy and the force of friction, you have 3 N going left.

64
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:19,773
So now I'll let you think about which of these have an unbalanced force in them, or another way to think about it,

65
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:24,304
which of these have a Net Force going on?

66
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:30,176
So let's look at the first scenario, we have a 5 N force of gravity acting towards the centre of the earth.

67
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:33,802
5 N normal force of the ground supporting the rock.

68
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:37,185
These have the same magnitude in the exact opposite directions

69
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:41,603
so they cancel out. These forces completely balance each other out.

70
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:48,274
There is zero net force going on, there are no forces the way I've drawn it, going on in the horizontal direction.

71
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,453
So you have zero net force, these right here are balanced.

72
00:05:51,453 --> 00:05:54,589
We would not consider this one of the scenarios we see an

73
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,210
unbalanced force.

74
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,367
Let's go to scenario 2.

75
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,192
Once again, 5 N up and 5 N down, they are balancing each other.

76
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:06,244
Then in the horizontal direction, this guy is pushing of 2 N to the right

77
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:10,994
is being completely balanced by the force of friction of 2 N to the left.

78
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:15,808
Because they're balanced there is no net force and this rock isn't going to accelerate.

79
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:22,744
So once again these are all balanced forces or there's no net force going on right over here.

80
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:25,888
In scenario 3. Once again, in the vertical direction.

81
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:30,940
The force of gravity is being balanced by the normal force of the ground.

82
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,408
Keeping the rock from plummeting or accelerating towards the centre of the earth.

83
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:37,857
And you do have two forces that are counteracting on the horizontal direction.

84
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:43,188
This guy's pushing harder with 3 N, but the force of friction is now 2 N to the left.

85
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:47,872
So you do have a net force to the right. 3 N to the right, 2 N to the left.

86
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:56,898
You have a net force of 1 N to the right.

87
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:59,140
Or you see it's right based on how I drew the vector.

88
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,911
So you do have a net force or in another way of thinking about it, that this is

89
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:10,372
a scenario where you have unbalanced forces, in particular, in the right left direction.

90
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:13,119
Now let's look at scenario 4.

91
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:17,401
We only have forces acting in this vertical direction.

92
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:20,463
You have the force of gravity 5 N downwards.

93
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:25,277
You have a counteracting force, the force of air resistance, I N upward.

94
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,332
But they don't completely balance out.

95
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:33,729
There is still a net force of 4 N downwards.

96
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,583
Therefore this is an unbalanced situation.

97
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,969
And finally in the last scenario.

98
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:43,936
We're sitting on the ground in the vertical direction, normal force counteracting the force of gravity.

99
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,111
Those are balanced.

100
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,534
But in the horizontal direction.

101
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:50,870
To the right we have more force, 4 N, than what we have going to the left.

102
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,244
3 N is the guy on the right plus the force of friction.

103
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:57,719
So in this situation there is a net force in the rightward direction.

104
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:02,722
A 1 N force to the right or 1 N net force.

105
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:09,995
This is a scenario where we have unbalanced forces.
