1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:04,559
Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers,

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,649
Let's think about how how we can divide them.

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:08,562
Now what you'll see is that it's actually

4
00:00:08,562 --> 00:00:10,632
a very similar methodology.

5
00:00:10,632 --> 00:00:12,164
That if both are positive,

6
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:15,455
you'll get a positive answer. If one is negative,

7
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,890
or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer.

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,542
And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer.

9
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:26,359
But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,473
and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get.

11
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:32,840
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2).

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,957
So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be

13
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:40,326
a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers

14
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:45,425
are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative.

15
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:49,556
So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4).

16
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:53,425
Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)--

17
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,423
now be very careful here.

18
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:59,727
If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4).

19
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:02,675
But because one of these two numbers is negative,

20
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:05,121
and exactly one of these two numbers is negative,

21
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:09,104
then I'm going to get a negative answer.

22
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:12,174
Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5).

23
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:17,285
If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6).

24
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:20,573
And because I have a negative divided by a negative,

25
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:25,631
the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)!

26
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,332
And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to,

27
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:30,448
but this is a positive six (6).

28
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:34,065
A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative,

29
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:37,063
you're gonna get a positive answer.

30
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,035
Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)!

31
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:40,612
And this is a little bit of a trick question.

32
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,934
This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers:

33
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:47,067
This is a positive divided by a positive.

34
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,035
Which is going to be a positive.

35
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:52,918
So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9).

36
00:01:52,918 --> 00:01:55,769
Now we start doing some interesting things,

37
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,967
here's kind of a compound problem.

38
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:01,464
We have some multiplication and some division going on.

39
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:03,698
And so first right over here, the way this is written,

40
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,030
we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out,

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,794
and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol,

42
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,164
it's just another way of writing multiplication.

43
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,381
I could've written this little "x" thing over here

44
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,628
but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common.

45
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,358
Because the X becomes used for other--

46
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:23,383
People don't want to confuse it with the letter X

47
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,584
which gets used a lot in Algebra.

48
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,927
That's why they used the dot very often.

49
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:31,093
So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3)

50
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,447
in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product

51
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,597
and divide it by negative one (-1).

52
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,640
So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3),

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,437
positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21),

54
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:45,303
but since exactly one of these two are negative,

55
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:47,078
this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21),

56
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,732
that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1).

57
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:51,894
And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1),

58
00:02:51,894 --> 00:02:54,944
negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive.

59
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:57,920
So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21).

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,510
Let me write all these things down.

61
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,266
So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative,

62
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:07,425
that's going to be a negative.

63
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:11,407
If I had a negative divided by a positive,

64
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:15,121
that's also going to be a negative.

65
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:18,020
If I have a negative divided by a negative,

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,454
that's going to give me a positive,

67
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:24,954
and if obviously a positive divided by a positive,

68
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,770
that's also going to give me a positive.

69
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,359
Now let's do this last one over here.

70
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,589
This is actually all multiplication,

71
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:31,989
but it's interesting, because we're multiplying

72
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,539
three (3) things, which we haven't done yet.

73
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:37,116
And we could just go from left to right over here,

74
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,405
and we could first think about negative two (-2) times

75
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,089
negative seven (-7).

76
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,627
Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7).

77
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,043
They are both negatives, and

78
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,094
negatives cancel out, so this would give us,

79
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,844
this part right over here,

80
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,539
will give us positive fourteen (14).

81
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,408
And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14)

82
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:55,207
times this negative one (-1), times -1.

83
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,908
Now we have a positive times a negative.

84
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:59,590
Exactly one of them is negative,

85
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,470
so this is going to be negative answer,

86
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,020
it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14).

87
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,087
Now let me give you a couple of more,

88
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,655
I guess we could call these trick problems.

89
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:12,070
What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by

90
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,252
negative five (-5).

91
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,503
Well this is zero negative fifths

92
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,219
So zero divided by anything that's non-zero

93
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,355
is just going to equal to zero.

94
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,035
But what if it were the other way around?

95
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:27,371
What happens if we said negative five divided by zero?

96
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,837
Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero.

97
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,522
We haven't defined that.

98
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,254
There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this,

99
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:38,301
so we traditionally do say that this is undefined.

100
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:43,213
We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero.

101
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:46,347
And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero,

102
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:50,431
this is still, this is still, undefined.
