1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,304
Maybe you like to draw squiggles when you're bored in class.

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,835
Somehow, the wandering path of the line that goes

3
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:07,186
in monotone droning of the teacher, perfectly capturing

4
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,051
the way it goes on and on about the same things over and over

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:14,103
but without really going anywhere in a deep display of artistic metaphor.

6
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,422
But once you're a veteran of bored doodling

7
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:18,369
you learn that some squiggles are better than others.

8
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,285
Good squiggles really fill up the page, squiggling around themselves

9
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:24,718
as densely as possible in a single line that doesn't cross itself.

10
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:27,635
It's like the ideal would be to sit down at the beginning

11
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:31,119
of your least favorite class, put your pencil on the page, and keep drawing a single line

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,369
filling up more and more space until the bell rings.

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:36,171
Which is basically what your teacher is doing, except with words.

14
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,218
You might find yourself developing some strategies.

15
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,902
For example, you're careful not to cut off a chunk of space

16
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:43,084
because you might want to get back in there later.

17
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,669
And if you leave only a little room to get to a certain section,

18
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,936
then when you go there, you fill up a lot of it

19
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:49,269
before you leave that section again.

20
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:53,085
Or else, instead of a "DO"-odle you'll have an unhappy "DON'T"-dle.

21
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:55,151
Or maybe you decide to make a meta-squiggle:

22
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:57,584
A squiggle made out of squiggles.

23
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:01,071
This can be done kind of abstractly, or extremely precisely.

24
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,769
For example, let's say you're drawing this simple squiggle.

25
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:06,751
Then, you draw that squiggle using that squiggle.

26
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,485
But to make it fill up space nicely,

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,953
you make the outside parts bigger.

28
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,369
Then to make it precise, you make the number of squiggles

29
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,777
always the same.

30
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:15,911
It's easy to keep squiggling this squiggle all the way

31
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,186
across the page if you keep the rhythm of it in your head.

32
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:18,995
This one's like:

33
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,495
[speaking rhythmically]

34
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:22,038
Down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle...

35
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:25,831
...down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle.

36
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:28,939
But after you've done that awhile, you decide to go a level deeper:

37
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,290
A squiggle within a squiggle within a squiggle!

38
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,290
That's right, we're going three levels down.

39
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,722
This serious business can go something like this:

40
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,889
Right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left...whoop!

41
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,889
.....right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left...whoop!...

42
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:45,072
...right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left...whoop!

43
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,333
And the next one's even crazier!

44
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:51,615
Like: And...Up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down...woop!...

45
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:54,370
.....up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down...woop!...

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,239
...up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down...woop!

47
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,402
Wop...all the way over here! And...

48
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:01,021
[speaking faster] Down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up...woop!

49
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,722
...Down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up...woop!...

50
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,670
...down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up...woop!...

51
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,021
Wop...all the way over here!

52
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:08,037
Okay, but say you're me and you're in math class.

53
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:09,954
This means that you have graph paper,

54
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:11,591
opportunity for precision.

55
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,491
You can draw that first curve like this:

56
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:15,601
[rhythmic speaking] squig-uh, squig-uh, squig-uh, squig-uh,

57
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,307
squig-uh, squig-uh, squig-uh, squig-uh...

58
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,975
The second iteration to fit squiggles going up and down

59
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:23,890
will have a line three boxes across on top and bottom.

60
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,836
If you want the squiggles close on the grid as possible without touching.

61
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,989
You might remind yourself by saying: Three uh-squig, uh-squig, a squiggle.

62
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,133
...Three uh-squig, uh-squig, a squiggle.

63
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,563
The next iteration has a "whoop".

64
00:02:35,563 --> 00:02:38,013
And you have to figure out how long that's going to be.

65
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:41,047
Meanwhile, other lengths change to keep everything close.

66
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,105
And...two a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

67
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:48,907
...three a squig, a squig, a squiggle; three a squig, a squig, a squiggle, two...nine.

68
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,310
Two a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,363
...three a squig, a squig, a squiggle; three a squig, a squig, a squiggle, two...nine.

70
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:56,329
We could write the pattern down like this.

71
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,379
So what would the next pattern be? Five.

72
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,052
Two a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

73
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,579
...three a squig, a squig, a squiggle

74
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,112
three a squig, a squig, a squigle...two

75
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,829
Nine.

76
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,280
Two a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,795
...three a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

78
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:12,212
three a squig, a squig, a squiggle...two

79
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:13,729
Nine.

80
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,013
Two a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

81
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,362
...three a squig, a squig, a squiggle...

82
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,397
three a squig, a squig, a squiggle...two

83
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:22,912
Nine...and 15 all the way over to here

84
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:26,848
And now...oh yeah, I can talk that fast! Totally!

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,017
Okay, but let's not get too far from the original purpose

86
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:31,429
which was to nicely fill a page with a squiggle.

87
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:35,113
The nicest page filling squiggles have kind of the same density

88
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:36,481
of squiggle everywhere.

89
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,063
You don't want to be clumped up here

90
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,712
but have left over space there,

91
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:41,082
because monsters might start growing

92
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,266
in the leftover space.

93
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,600
On graph paper you can be kind of precise about it.

94
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,182
Say you want a squiggle that goes through

95
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:49,230
every box exactly once and can be extended infinitely.

96
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,419
So you try some of those and decide that since the point

97
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,721
of them is to fill up all the space, you call them

98
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,421
space filling curves.

99
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,406
Yes, that's actually a technical term, but be careful

100
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,055
because your curve might actually be a...

101
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:05,622
[rhymic speaking] ...snake, x23

102
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,237
Also to make it nearter, you draw the lines on the lines

103
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:10,424
and shift the rules so you go through each intersection

104
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,175
on the graph paper exactly once

105
00:04:12,175 --> 00:04:15,293
which is the same thing as far as space is concerned.

106
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:18,191
Okay, heres the space filling curve that a guy named Hilbert made up.

107
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,589
Because Hilbert was awesome, but he's dead now.

108
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,895
Here's the first iteration.

109
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,329
For the second one, we're going to build it

110
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,863
piece by piece by connecting four copies of the first.

111
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:28,079
So here's one. Put the second a space away

112
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,963
next to it and connect those,

113
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:30,946
then turn the page

114
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,913
to put the third sideways under the first

115
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:33,747
and connect those.

116
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,780
And then the fourth will be the mirror image of that

117
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,807
on the other side.

118
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:38,206
Now you've got one nice curve.

119
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:41,513
The third iteration will be made out of four copies of the second iteration.

120
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:45,580
So first build another second iteration curve out of four copies of the first iteration...

121
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,579
...one, two, three, four...

122
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:49,545
Then put another next to it, then two sideways on the bottom.

123
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,446
Connect them all up; there you go!

124
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:54,796
The fourth iteration is made of four copies of the third iteration

125
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:55,563
the same way.

126
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,879
If you learn to do the second iteration in one piece,

127
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,097
it will make this go faster.

128
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:02,180
Then build 2 third iterations facing up next to each other

129
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,146
and two underneath sideways.

130
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:06,196
You can keep going until you run out of room.

131
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:08,479
Or you can make each new version the same size

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,028
by making each line half the length.

133
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,097
Or you can make it out of snakes.

134
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,129
Or if you have friends, you can each make an iteration

135
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,161
of the same size and put them together

136
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:19,313
or invent your own fractal curve so that you can be cool like Hilbert,

137
00:05:19,313 --> 00:05:23,313
who was like: "Mathematics? [scoff sound] Pff...I'm going to invent meta-mathematics! Like a boss."
