00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:05,290
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,565
So 0.8... the 8 right over here

3
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:12,421
is in the tenths place. It is the tenths place. So you can read this

4
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:15,959
as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,104
being equal to 8 tenths

6
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:22,664
or 8 over 10. And now, we've already written it as

7
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:25,299
a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down.

8
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:29,687
Both 8 and 10 share common factors, they are both divisible by 2.

9
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:38,751
So lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2. We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing

10
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,264
8 divided by 2 is 4,

11
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:45,934
10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done.

12
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:50,513
0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing

13
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:53,000
as 4 fifths.
