00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
What I wanna do in this video is talk a little bit about maybe why the plates are actually moving in the first place.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,628
And nothing I'm talking about in this video has been definitively proved,

3
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:16,676
this is just kind of the current thinking, the leading thinking on why plates are actually moving.

4
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:18,810
Although we haven't seen the definitive evidence yet

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,010
and there's probably a combination of a bunch of things.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,373
Now before we even talk about plates, let's just talk about convection.

7
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:27,803
And you might already be familiar with the term,

8
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:31,201
but just in case you're not, let's do a little bit of review of convection.

9
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,803
So let's say I have a pot over here,

10
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:39,602
so that is my pot and it contains some water.

11
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,536
So I have water in my pot.

12
00:00:42,536 --> 00:00:45,733
And let's say I only heat one end of the pot.

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,203
So I put a flame right over at that end of the pot.

14
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:49,403
So what's going to happen?

15
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:52,942
Well the water that's right overthe flame

16
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:55,795
is going to be warmed up more then any of the other water.

17
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:59,323
so this water is going to get warmed.

18
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:03,124
But when it gets warmed, it also becomes less dense.

19
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:04,923
when you have a fluid, if you warm it up,

20
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:09,124
the molecules are vibrating more, they have more kinetic energy,

21
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:12,106
they're going to bounce further distances away from each other,

22
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,066
they will become less dense.

23
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,792
and if you have something that's less dense

24
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,609
and it's surrounded by things that are more dense,

25
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,281
and we're dealing with a kind of fluid state right here,

26
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:27,258
that warm less dense water is going to move upwards.

27
00:01:27,258 --> 00:01:32,326
When it moves upwards, something has to replace it,

28
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:36,457
so you're going to have cooler water from this side of the container

29
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:39,199
kind of replacing with that water.

30
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:44,204
Now, this water as it rises, what's going to happen to it?

31
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,660
Well, it's going to cool down,

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,593
it's going to get further from the flame, it's going to mix with maybe some of the other water,

33
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:53,988
where the other water transfers some of its kinetic energy to the neighboring water,

34
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,542
so it will cool down.

35
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,462
But once it cools down, what is going the water do?

36
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:01,372
Remember, in general, the closer you are to the flame,

37
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:05,321
so the water closer to the flame in general is going to be warmer,

38
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,060
so all of this stuff is going to be warmer

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,727
and all of this stuff up here, like the coldest water is always going to be furthest from the flame.

40
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,998
And so the coldest water is going to be over here,

41
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:17,330
but remember, the coldest water is also the densest water.

42
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,931
So this water over here is dense.

43
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:24,664
And so it will sink, it's denser than the water around it,

44
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:27,538
and it also helps to replace the water that's going here to get warmed up again.

45
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:29,925
And so you the cycle here:

46
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:33,283
warm water rises, moves over to the right right here

47
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:37,391
and then goes back down as it cools down and is denser, then it gets warmed up again.

48
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:43,035
So this process is essentially transferring the heat.

49
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:47,791
It's allowing the heat to be transformed from this warm spot throughout the fluid.

50
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:54,249
So we call this process as this is convection.

51
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:57,321
Now, the reason why we think the plates are moving

52
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:01,658
is because we think that there are similar types of convection currents

53
00:03:01,658 --> 00:03:07,856
in the asthenosphere, in the mantle, in the more fluid part of the mantle.

54
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:12,946
Remember, most of the mantle you can view as the mushy, spongy,

55
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:18,250
not quite liquid but not quite solid state, kind of plastic,

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:28,495
kind of mush paste, it can kind of flow like a super super thick, you know...

57
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:34,198
like super-viscous fliud, so not quite solid, not quite liquid. But the same thing could be happening.

58
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:39,790
You have certain areas in the mantle that are hotter than others, in particular in the asthenosphere,

59
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:47,060
and those areas, that's where you're going to have the material of the mantle moving up

60
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,591
bacause it's hotter, it's less dense and it will move up

61
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:59,057
and maybe it will cause one of these divergent rifts where plate material and crustal material is forming.

62
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:06,676
And then as it moves up it cools down,

63
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:10,885
and eventually sinks.

64
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:13,132
Although here it get heated up again.

65
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:16,875
So it has these kind of circular motion just like we saw with the boiling water.

66
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:21,216
And so that process, remember this isn't completely liquid, it is rocky,

67
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:25,131
so it's going to potentially be able to take other things with it,

68
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:29,533
it could maybe drag the crust along with it and that would cause,

69
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:33,656
actually it could drag the lithosphere along with it, not just the crust,

70
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,781
it could drag all this rigid rock appear along with it

71
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:41,393
causing it to move in that general direction.

72
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:45,195
So you have the drag there, you can also imagine that this kind of suction effect,

73
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:48,869
where if you view it as a fluid you have a bunch of fluid coming down here,

74
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:52,465
so it kind of pull the lithosphere down at those points

75
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:58,198
and if will kind of push the lithosphere up at those points.

76
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:04,611
So you have these convection currents that are essentially dragging...

77
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:08,590
you know, these aren't going to be super-fast-moving fluid convection currents

78
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,868
like you would expect with boiling water or with heated water,

79
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:15,262
these would be slow-moving convection currents, but they're moving enough

80
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:20,794
and they're able to kind of put enough drag on the lithosphere to take the lithosphere along with it.

81
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:26,113
And so that's kind of the high level, the dominant theory as to why the're moving.

82
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,531
There's other one to talk about,

83
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:36,619
maybe these lithospheric plates they kind of thicken as they move further away from this area

84
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:40,656
where the ridge is forming if we look at this oceanic crust right over here,

85
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:44,796
and so over time they're denser over here

86
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:48,327
because there's more cooled down material at these points

87
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:53,927
and that's already a little bit lower because this is where a lot of the land has been created

88
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:55,795
and so there's some gravitational effect,

89
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:59,795
but the dominant effect we think is due to this convection in the upper mantle.
