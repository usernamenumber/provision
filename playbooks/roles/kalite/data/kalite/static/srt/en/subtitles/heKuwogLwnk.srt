1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,881
We're now ready to talk about

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:04,367
one of the most famous events

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:05,668
in all of world history

4
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:08,593
that really was the trigger for World War 1

5
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:10,817
or the Great War as it was called back then.

6
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:12,749
So this is a little bit of backdrop.

7
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:16,574
In 1908, the austro-hungarian empire

8
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,470
formally annexes

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,894
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

10
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,422
It had already been occupying it

11
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,867
since the late 1800s,

12
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:30,619
since the Ottomans were being pushed out,

13
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:33,960
but in1908 it formally annexes it.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,027
As a little bit more backdrop:

15
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:40,978
as the Ottomans were being pushed out of the Balkans,

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,709
it helped to bring about more hope

17
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:48,522
of unifying the Yugoslavic people;

18
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:50,309
the "Southern Slavic" people.

19
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,640
When people talk about Yugoslav,

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,610
They are literally talking about the Southern Slavs.

21
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,249
That literally means 'Southern'.

22
00:00:58,249 --> 00:00:59,889
So you had these nationalistic hopes.

23
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:03,179
But now in 1908 it was already being occupied;

24
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,233
a significant state

25
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:07,634
that would be part of a potential future Yugoslav,

26
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:11,350
was now formally annexed by the Austro-Hungarians.

27
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,432
Now you also had an independent Kingdom of Serbia

28
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:16,561
-right here- and you can imagine

29
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,405
that this was the home base of the nationalistic movement:

30
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:23,107
if only they could add the other Southern Slavic States to this,

31
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:26,470
it could one day turn into a Greater Yugoslavia.

32
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,003
So in that context we get to 1914.

33
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,728
So let me draw a line here.

34
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,493
We are getting to 1914, June 28,

35
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,623
which is one of the most famous dates

36
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:40,310
in all of history.

37
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,610
Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie

38
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,754
are visiting Sarajevo, which is now

39
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:50,860
in annexed Bosnia.

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,450
And when they're there,

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,919
there is a scheme to assassinate them

42
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,488
from a group called 'the young Bosnians'

43
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,355
who have ties to 'the black hand',

44
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:06,423
which is a kind of nationalistic group

45
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:09,016
that has ties to

46
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:12,710
- these things are all very shady -

47
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,080
but it has has ties to

48
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,449
elements in the Kingdom of Serbia.

49
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:19,676
They attempt to assassinate

50
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,670
archduke Franz Ferdinand.

51
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,790
It is actually a fascinating story, because

52
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,751
the initial assassination attempt

53
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,073
is completely botched.

54
00:02:29,073 --> 00:02:30,459
There is one case of a guy

55
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,200
who tried to be an assassin;

56
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,321
when it gets botched, he tries

57
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,900
to bite on a cyanide capsule

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,664
and then jump into a river,

59
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:39,336
but the cyanide capsule had gone bad

60
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,966
the river was only 10 inches deep,

61
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:43,099
so they were able to get their hands on him.

62
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,079
One of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip,

63
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,392
once the whole thing was botched

64
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:50,839
he gives up on the whole assassination attempt

65
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:55,499
and he is literally having a sandwich at
a cafe in sarajevo

66
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,519
thinking about how botched their whole attempt was,

67
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,652
and while that was happening,

68
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:03,099
a mistake on the part of those planning

69
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,969
archduke Franz Ferdinand's route

70
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,760
as he was traveling within Sarajevo

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,076
has them driving right near Gavrilo Princip.

72
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,440
So he sees suddenly that they've taken the wrong route

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,290
and they are driving right by him again.

74
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,974
Remember: these people already knew

75
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,766
that there was an assassination attempt on him

76
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,993
earlier in the day

77
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,315
so they should have been more careful.

78
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:25,879
Gavrilo Princip gets up, puts his sandwich down,

79
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,330
and starts walking over to where he sees

80
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,669
archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie's car going.

81
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,079
The drivers once they realized that they had made a mistake,

82
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,899
that they had taken a less safe route,

83
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:38,408
they try to back up

84
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:39,432
which makes things even worse

85
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,032
because then the car starts stalling.

86
00:03:41,032 --> 00:03:43,841
Gavrilo Princip just walks up to the car

87
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,432
and is able to shoot

88
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,299
archduke Franz Ferdinand and Sophie.

89
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,350
Just to give you a sense of how important this is:

90
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,939
archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria is the heir,

91
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,156
he is the nephew of Franz Joseph,

92
00:03:56,156 --> 00:04:00,610
who was the ruler of Austria-Hungary,

93
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,810
and so he is the heir to the empire.

94
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,759
And he gets assassinated by Gavrilo Princip.

95
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:18,241
so... Franz Ferdinand Assassinated

96
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:20,332
by Gavrilo Princip.

97
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,780
And we have right over here

98
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,659
a picture of right after Gavrilo Princip...

99
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:27,047
- I believe this is him over here -

100
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,969
right after he was arrested.

101
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,690
Just to get a little sense of how this was tied

102
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,966
to this whole Yugoslavian

103
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,479
nationalistic movement,

104
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,949
this is what he said once he was arrested:

105
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,232
"I am a Yugoslav nationalist..."

106
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:46,566
"...aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, ..."

107
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,729
"...and I do not care what form of state..."

108
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,159
"...but it must be free of Austria."

109
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,520
So this act, this assassination,

110
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,966
motivated by a nationalistic movement,

111
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,299
motivated by a desire to maybe merge

112
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,566
Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia

113
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:06,234
maybe eventually Croatia with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia,

114
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:08,039
this assassination as we will see in the next video

115
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,123
is the trigger for all of World War 1.

116
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:14,299
And the reason why it triggers it is because...

117
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:16,232
-- well there's many things you can cite;

118
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,560
you could argue that many of the empires in Europe

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,930
are already militarizing, already had a desire for conflict.

120
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,150
But then you also had all of these alliances

121
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,894
that essentially allowed the dominoes to fall

122
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,766
in all of Europe

123
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:29,639
and because they had these empires

124
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,100
essentially much of the world

125
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,320
to be at war with each other
