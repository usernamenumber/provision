1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
   

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,320
This video here is a
groundbreaking video

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,340
for multiple reasons.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,910
One, I'm going to introduce you
to the variance of a sample,

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,750
which is interesting
it in its own right.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,520
And I'm attempting to
record this video in HD.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,370
And hopefully you can see
it bigger and clearer

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,030
than ever before.

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,150
But we'll see how
all of that goes.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,060
So this is a bit of an
experiment, so bear with me.

11
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,180
But so, just before we go into
the variance of a sample, I

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,090
think it's instructive to
review the variance

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,870
of a population.

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,180
And we can compare
their formulas.

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,790
The variance of a population--
And it's this greek

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,100
letter sigma.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,420
Lowercase sigma squared.

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,500
That means variance.

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,010
I know it's weird that
a variable already

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,710
has a square in it.

21
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,840
You're not squaring
the variable.

22
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,240
This is the variable.

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,780
Sigma squared mean variance.

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,840
Actually, let me
write that down.

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,005
That equals variance.

26
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:51,550
   

27
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,430
And that is equal to-- You
take each data point-- And

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,800
we'll call them x sub i.

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,700
You take each data of point,
find out how far it is from the

30
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:08,750
mean of the population, you
square it, and then you take

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,160
the average of all of those.

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,900
So you take the average,
you sum them all up.

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,200
You go from i is equal to 1.

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,700
So from the first point, all
the way to the nth point.

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,940
And then, to average,
you sum them all up and

36
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,970
then you divide by n.

37
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,970
So the variance is the average
of these squared distances

38
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,390
of each point from the mean.

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,700
And just to give you the
intuition again, it essentially

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,920
says, on average, roughly how
far away are each of the

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,420
points from the middle.

42
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,250
That's the best way to
think about the variance.

43
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,640
Now what if we're
dealing-- This was for

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,140
a population, right?

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,050
And we said if we wanted to
figure out the variance of

46
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,580
men's heights in the country,
it'd be very hard to

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,480
figure out the variance
for the population.

48
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,910
You would have to go and,
essentially, measure

49
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,790
everyone's height.

50
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,360
250 million people.

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,080
Or what if it's for some
population where it's just

52
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,860
completely impossible to
have the data or some

53
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,640
random variable.

54
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,100
And we'll go more
into that later.

55
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,660
So a lot of times you actually
want to estimate this variance

56
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,690
by taking the variance
of a sample.

57
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,420
Same way that you could never
get the mean of a population,

58
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,570
but maybe you want to estimate
it by getting the

59
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,064
mean of a sample.

60
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,890
And we learned that
in that first video.

61
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,520
If this is-- If that's
the whole population.

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,280
That's millions of data points,
or even data points in the

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,870
future that you'll never be
able to get because it's

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,290
a random variable.

65
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,243
So this is the population.

66
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,920
   

67
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,390
You might just want to estimate
things by looking at a sample.

68
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,020
And this is actually what
most of inferential

69
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,360
statistics is all about.

70
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,720
Figuring out descriptive
statistics about the sample

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,890
and make inferences
about the population.

72
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,610
Let me try this drug on 100
people and if it seems to have

73
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,880
statistically significant
results, this drug will

74
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,850
probably work on the
population as a whole.

75
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,800
So that's what it's all about.

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
So it's really important to
understand this notion of a

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,580
sample versus a population.

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,510
And being able to find
statistics on a sample that,

79
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,160
for the most part, can describe
the population or help us

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,720
estimate, they call it,
parameters for the population.

81
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,330
So what's the mean of a-- Let
me rewrite these definitions.

82
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,830
What's the mean
of a population?

83
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,940
I'll do that purple.

84
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,630
Purple for population.

85
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,680
The mean of a population.

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,700
You just take each of the data
points in the population, x i.

87
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,850
You sum them up.

88
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,830
You start with the first data
point and you go all the

89
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,620
way to the nth data point.

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,740
And you divide by n.

91
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,800
You sum them all up
and divide by n.

92
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
That's the mean.

93
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,500
So then you plug it
into this formula.

94
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,060
And you can see how far each
point is from that central

95
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,270
point, from that mean.

96
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,260
And you get the variance.

97
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,670
Now what happens if we
do it for a sample?

98
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,350
Well, if we want to estimate
the mean of a population by

99
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,600
somehow calculating a mean for
a sample, the best thing I can

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,170
think of-- And really these are
kind of engineered formulas.

101
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,140
These are human beings saying,
well what is the best

102
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,710
way to sample it?

103
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,550
Well all we can do is really
take an average of our sample.

104
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,820
And that's the sample mean.

105
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,920
And we learned in the first
video that that notation--

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,450
The formula is almost
identical of this.

107
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,540
It's just the
notation's different.

108
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,990
Instead of writing mu, you
write x with a line over it.

109
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,620
Sample mean is equal to-- Once
again, you take each of the

110
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,100
data points now in the sample,
not in the whole population.

111
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,370
You sum them up from the
first one and then to

112
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,380
the nth one, right?

113
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,640
They're saying that there are
n data points in this sample.

114
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,390
And then you divide it by the
number of data points you have.

115
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,320
Fair enough.

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,660
It's really the same formula.

117
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,500
The way I took the mean of a
population, I said, well, if I

118
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,590
just have a sample, let me just
take the mean the same way.

119
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,560
And it's probably a good
estimate of the mean

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,930
of the population.

121
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,340
Now it gets interesting when
we talk about variance.

122
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,250
So your natural reaction is
OK, I have this sample.

123
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,260
If I want to estimate the
variance of the population, why

124
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,230
don't I just apply this same
formula essentially

125
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,150
to the sample?

126
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,330
So I could say-- And this is
actually a sample variance.

127
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,570
They use the formula s squared.

128
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,220
So sigma is kind of the greek
letter equivalent of s.

129
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,980
So now when we're dealing
with the sample, we

130
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,000
just write the s there.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
So this is sample variance.

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,070
Let me write that down.

133
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,950
Sample variance.

134
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:11,860
   

135
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,870
This is-- So we might just say,
well maybe a good way to take

136
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,340
the sample variance is
do it the same way.

137
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,670
Let's take the distance of each
of the points in the sample.

138
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,600
Find out how far it is
from our sample mean.

139
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,230
Here we used the population
mean, but now we'll just use

140
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,450
the sample mean because
that's all we can have.

141
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,160
We don't know what the
population mean is

142
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,510
without looking at the
whole population.

143
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,400
Take the square of that.

144
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
That makes it positive and
it has other properties,

145
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
which we'll go over later.

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,730
And then take the average of
all of these squared distances.

147
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,970
So you take it from--
You sum them all up.

148
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,430
And there's n of them
to some up, right?

149
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,400
Lowercase n.

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,820
And you divide by lowercase n.

151
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,230
And you say, well this
is a good estimate.

152
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,580
Well whatever this variance is,
that might be a good estimate

153
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,720
for the population whole.

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,620
Actually this is what some
people often refer to when they

155
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,980
talk about sample variance.

156
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,260
And sometimes it'll actually
be referred to as this.

157
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,520
They'll put a little
lowercase n there.

158
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,840
And the reason why they do that
is because we divided by n.

159
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,840
And you say, Sal what's
the problem here?

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
And the problem-- And I'll give
you the intuition because this

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,180
is actually something that
used to boggle my mind.

162
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,340
And I'm still frankly
struggling with the

163
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,530
intuition behind it.

164
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,510
Well I have the intuition, but
more of kind of rigorously

165
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,950
proving it to myself that
this is definitely the case.

166
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,280
But think about this.

167
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,905
If I have a bunch of
numbers, and I'll draw

168
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,740
a number line here.

169
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
If I draw a number line here--
So let's say you know that--

170
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,430
And let's say I have a bunch
of numbers in my population.

171
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,660
So let's say-- I'm just going
to randomly put a bunch

172
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,280
numbers in my population.

173
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,928
And the ones to the right
are bigger than the

174
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:46,355
ones to the left.

175
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,900
   

176
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,990
And if I were to take a sample
of them, maybe I take--

177
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,820
The sample, it's random.

178
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,210
You actually want to
take a random sample.

179
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,320
You don't want to be
skewed in any way.

180
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,900
So maybe I take this one,
this one, this one,

181
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,420
and that one, right?

182
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,480
And then if I were to take the
mean of that number, that

183
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,460
number, that number,
that number.

184
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,320
It will be someplace
in the middle.

185
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,010
It might be someplace
over there.

186
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,240
And then if I wanted to figure
out the sample variance using

187
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,780
this formula, I'd say OK this
distance squared plus this

188
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,060
distance squared plus this
distance squared plus that

189
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,520
distance squared and
average them all out.

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,700
And then I would
get this number.

191
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,820
And that probably would be a
pretty good approximation for

192
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,260
the variance of this
entire population.

193
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,070
The population of the mean
is probably going to

194
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,030
be-- I don't know.

195
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,020
It might be pretty
close to this.

196
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,150
If we actually took all of the
data points and averaged them,

197
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,060
maybe they're like
here someplace.

198
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,660
And then if you figure out the
variance, it probably would be

199
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,590
pretty close to the average of
all of these lines, right?

200
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,810
All of the sample variance
distances, right?

201
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,250
Fair enough.

202
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,900
So you say, hey Sal.

203
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,710
This looks pretty good now.

204
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,940
But there's one little catch.

205
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,560
What if-- There's always a
probability that instead of

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,990
picking these kind of fairly
well-distributed numbers in my

207
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,800
sample, what if I happen to
pick this number, this number,

208
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,920
and that number as my-- and
let's say that number

209
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,400
as my sample?

210
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,370
Well whatever your sample
is, your sample mean is

211
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,210
always going to be in
the middle of it, right?

212
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,960
So in this case, your sample
mean might be right here.

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,010
So all of these numbers, you
might say OK this number is not

214
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,810
too far from that number, that
number's not too far, and then

215
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,100
that number's not too far.

216
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,790
So your sample variance, when
you do it this way, might

217
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,610
turn out a little bit low.

218
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,920
Because all of these numbers,
they're pretty-- they're,

219
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
almost by definition, going to
be pretty close to the

220
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,350
mean of each other.

221
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,600
But in this case, your sample
is kind of skewed and the

222
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,980
actual mean of the population
is out here someplace.

223
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,800
So the actual variance of the
sample, if you had actually

224
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,670
known the mean-- I know this
is all a little confusing.

225
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,980
If you had actually known
the mean, you would

226
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,830
have said oh wow.

227
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,386
You would have found these
distances, which would

228
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:51,320
have been a lot more.

229
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,640
The whole point of what I'm
saying is, when you take a

230
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,280
sample, there's some chance
that your sample mean is pretty

231
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,380
close to the population
mean, right?

232
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,610
Maybe your sample mean is
here and your population

233
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,360
mean is here.

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,770
And then this formula will
probably work out pretty well,

235
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,770
at least given your sample data
points and figuring out

236
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,280
what the variance is.

237
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,240
But there's a reasonable chance
that your sample mean-- Your

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,730
sample is always going to be
within your data sample, right?

239
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,740
It's always going to be the
center of your data sample.

240
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,470
But it's completely possible
that the population mean is

241
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,590
outside of your data sample.

242
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
It might have just been you
just happen to pick ones

243
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,110
that don't contain the
actual population mean.

244
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,670
And then this sample variance
calculated this way will

245
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,990
actually underestimate the
actual population

246
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,240
variance, right?

247
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,230
Because they're always going to
be closer to their own mean

248
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,960
than they are to the
population mean.

249
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,460
And if you're understanding,
frankly, even like 10%

250
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,770
of this, you are a very
advanced statistics student.

251
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,120
But I'm saying all of this to
just give you, hopefully, some

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,500
intuition to realize that this
will often underestimate.

253
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,240
This formula will often
underestimate the actual

254
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,110
population variance.

255
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,420
And there's a formula, and
this is actually proven more

256
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,740
rigorously than I will do it,
that is considered to be a

257
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,000
better, or they'll call it an
unbiased, estimate of the

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,030
population variance.

259
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,390
Or the unbiased
sample variance.

260
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,160
And sometimes it's just denoted
by the s squared again.

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,930
Sometimes it's denoted by
this s n minus 1 squared.

262
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,720
And I'll show you why.

263
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,340
It's almost the same thing.

264
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,730
You take each of the data
points, figure out how far they

265
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,170
are from the sample mean.

266
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,900
You square them.

267
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,830
And then you take the average
of those squared, except

268
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,430
for one slight difference.

269
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,720
i equals 1 to i equals n.

270
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,370
Instead of dividing by n,
you divide by a slightly

271
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,920
smaller number.

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,350
You divide by n minus 1.

273
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,880
So when you divide my n minus
1 instead of dividing by

274
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,590
n, you're going to get a
slightly larger number here.

275
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,060
And it turns out that
this is actually a

276
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,260
much better estimate.

277
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,810
And one day I'm going to write
a computer program to at least

278
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,430
prove it to myself
experimentally that this is a

279
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,750
better estimate of the
population variance.

280
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,430
And you would calculate
it the same way.

281
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,270
You just divide by n minus 1.

282
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,450
The other way to think about
it-- And actually, no.

283
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,340
I'm all out of time.

284
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,500
I'll leave you there now.

285
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,710
And then in the next video,
we'll do a couple of

286
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,590
calculations just so you
don't get too overwhelmed

287
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,270
with these ideas.

288
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,810
Because we're getting a
little bit abstract.

289
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,660
See you in the next video.

290
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,000
