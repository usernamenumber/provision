1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,940
Add and simplify the answer and
write as a mixed number.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,490
So we have two mixed
numbers here.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,700
We have a whole number part
and a fraction part.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,430
We need to add them.

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,660
Now, there's two ways
to do this.

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,680
You could convert both of these
into improper fractions,

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,800
then add them, and then
convert that back

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,290
into a mixed number.

10
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,720
Or you could just look at this
and say, well, you know what?

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:28,630
17 and 2/9 is the exact same
thing as 17 plus 2/9, and then

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:38,640
5 and 1/9 is the exact same
thing as 5 plus 1/9, so 17 and 2/9

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,550
plus 5 and 1/9 is the same
thing as 17 plus

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,260
2/9 plus 5 plus 1/9.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,800
These two statements are
completely equivalent.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,510
And we know that when you're
just adding a bunch of

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,970
numbers, it doesn't matter what
order you do it in, so

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,040
you can swap the order.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,540
So you could say that this is
the same thing as 17 plus 5

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,740
plus 2/9 plus 1/9.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,840
   

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,780
And we could do this
in any order.

23
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,030
And we know what 17 plus 5 is.

24
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,760
We've done that before.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,010
17 plus 5 is 22, so that
part right there is 22.

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:27,470
So we have 22 plus-- now
what is 2/9 plus 1/9?

27
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,720
Well, they have the same
denominator, so it's going to

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,290
be over 9, and then you
add the numerators.

29
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,040
2 plus 1 is 3.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,540
So it's 22 plus 3/9, but
this can be simplified.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,130
Both the numerator and
the denominator are

32
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,120
divisible by 3.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,080
Divide the numerator
by 3, you get 1.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,570
Divide the denominator
by 3, you get 3.

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:55,800
So this is 22 plus 1/3, which is
the exact same thing as 22

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,920
and-- let me write it in that
other blue color-- which is

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,805
the exact same thing
as 22 and 1/3.

38
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:05,599
