1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,000
We are starting off with triangle ABC

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,600
When we see the triangle we know that length

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:21,067
of AB = AC. This is a triangle with 2 sides of equal length

4
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:32,933
We call this an isosceles triangle

5
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,067
This means two sides are equal to each other.

6
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:45,400
What i want to prove here is that these angles

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,400
the angles opposite to the sides that are equal

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,733
are the same. For side AC the opposite angle is angle ABC

9
00:00:53,733 --> 00:00:56,467
and for side AB the opposite angle is angle ACB

10
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:11,600
I want to prove angle ABC = angle ACB

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:36,733
So we have a lot of information here

12
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:45,133
and the first step is to construct two triangles

13
00:01:45,133 --> 00:02:04,133
to construct two triangles, set up another point D here.

14
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:13,333
Let us say D is the mid point of line BC

15
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:24,933
this means BD = DC.

16
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:31,333
Let me draw segment AD. Now we have constructed

17
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:43,000
two triangles, triangle ABD & triangle ADC

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,733
In these two triangles, AB = AC, BD = DC and they share

19
00:02:46,733 --> 00:03:04,600
the side AD.We know that triangle ABD = traingle ACD

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:16,067
we know this because all sides of these triangles are equal

21
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:19,067
What is useful about this information is if the sides are equal

22
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:28,667
then their angles are equal.We have proved our result.

23
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:47,133
angle ABC = angle ACB

24
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:54,133
If we have an isosceles triangle with two sides equal

25
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,733
then their base angles or angle opposite to these sides

26
00:03:57,733 --> 00:03:59,467
are equal.

27
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,533
Now can we make the other statement, if the

28
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:06,733
base angles are equal then the opposite sides are

29
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:14,533
of teh same length. Let us construct another triangle

30
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:32,733
this triangle is called ABC, and am going to start

31
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:43,067
with the idea that angle ABC = angle ACB

32
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:51,867
what we want to do is to prove

33
00:04:51,867 --> 00:05:11,267
that sides AB = side AC

34
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:27,600
or length of AB = length of AC

35
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
We need to have two triangles to prove this.

36
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,467
Like we did earlier let us construct two triangles

37
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,800
This time instead of defining the other point as mid point

38
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:52,000
I am going to define D as the point that goes

39
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,667
straight down from A

40
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:12,933
This point intersects BC at a right angle

41
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:18,067
Then in the two triangles these angles will be 90 degrees

42
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,400
What is interesting about this is

43
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,667
i have constructed AD such that

44
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:47,333
AD is perpendicular to BC

45
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:55,600
So over here we an angle and side in common

46
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:05,600
We know these triangles are same by AAS method

47
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:12,733
that is Angle Angle Side ( AAS)

48
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:27,733
triangle ABD = triangle ACD

49
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:37,267
If we know two triangles are equal, then

50
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:43,467
every corresponding angle or side of the two triangles are same

51
00:07:43,467 --> 00:08:03,333
So we know sides AB = AC

52
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,267
Now we have proved that if two angles are equal,

53
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:09,333
then their opposite sides are of same length

54
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:29,667
So side BD = side DC , side AB = side AC

55
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:44,800
So point D is not only the mid point ,

56
00:08:44,800 --> 99:59:59,999
it is the place where AD bisects BC at 90 degrees

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're starting off with the triangle ABC here.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we see from the drawing that the length of AB is equal to the length BC.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or line segment AB is congruent to line segment AC.

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And since this is a triangle and two sides of this triangle are congruent

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or they have the same length. We can say that this is an isosceles triangle.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Isosceles triangle a hard way for me to spell

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that just means that two of the sides are equal to each other.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're starting off with triangle ABC here

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we see from the drawing that the length of AB is equal to the length of AC
