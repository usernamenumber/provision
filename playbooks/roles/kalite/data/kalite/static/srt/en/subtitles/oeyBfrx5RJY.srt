1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,820
We've done several videos now
on amines, which I forgot to

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,840
mention, and this is probably
the most fun notion about

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,932
amines, is that they
tend to be smelly.

5
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,380
Let me write this down.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,440
Amines tend to be smelly.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,570
And I can make the smelly
smell a little bit.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,470
And in general, in their gaseous
state, they'll often

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,470
smell like ammonia, so it's a
very strong smell, or in their

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,840
liquid state, they usually
smell like fish,

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,610
or even dead fish.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,910
They smell like fish.

13
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:37,190
And, in particular, if you look
at trimethylamine, so

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,270
this is-- let me draw
it like this.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,325
H3C, you have your nitrogen.

16
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:47,260
You have CH3 and then
you have your CH3.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,850
And you can even draw
the lone pair.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,980
This is trimethylamine.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,110
This is the fish smell.

20
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,970
This right here is
the fish smell.

21
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,950
Now, the whole reason why I
brought this up is because in

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,970
this video, we're going to
introduce a new type of

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,030
molecule, and that's
an aldehyde.

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,520
And I want to contrast
their smells.

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,190
Now, some of the smaller
aldehydes still have a pretty

26
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,900
strong smell, in particular,
formaldehyde.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,140
And we'll talk a little
bit more about

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,030
why this is an aldehyde.

29
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,750
So this right here is
formaldehyde, and that's the

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,830
common name.

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,610
And you've probably seen
it used as a kind of

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,250
preservative.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,410
Maybe even in your biology
class, if there's like a dead

34
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,800
frog in a solution, it's
probably inside of

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,590
formaldehyde.

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,350
Let me write this down.

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,190
Formaldehyde.

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,700
Once again, this is
the common name.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,680
I'm going to teach you in a
second how to systematically

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,860
name these things.

41
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,630
But when you have larger
aldehydes, they actually can

42
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,500
have a pretty sweet or
even a rosy smell.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,480
So you have something like
benzaldehyde, which you

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,340
actually saw when we started
the benzene derivatives.

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,040
So this is benzaldehyde
right over here.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,730
   

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,410
Let me write this down.

48
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,660
This is benzaldehyde.

49
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,120
   

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,700
And then this molecule here,
just when I tell you what it's

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,270
called, you'll probably guess
what it smells like.

52
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,670
So this has a benzene
ring like this.

53
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,470
And then you have one,
two, three carbons.

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,030
The last one's double bonded
to an oxygen and then a

55
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,300
hydrogen like there, and
they have a double

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,670
bond right over here.

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,410
And this is called
cinnamaldehyde.

58
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:43,120
   

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,720
And as you could guess, this
smells like cinnamon.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,070
And, in fact, this is the
molecule in cinnamon that

61
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,400
gives it its smell, although you
don't want to have large

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,170
quantities of it or it
might be poisonous.

63
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,700
But in cinnamon, it's a
very pleasant thing.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,930
So larger aldehydes tend to
have kind of a nice, rosy,

65
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,245
sweet, flowery smell.

66
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,250
The smaller ones tend to
be kind of pungent.

67
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,950
If you open up that jar in your
biology class and smell

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,010
that frog, it will not
be a pleasant smell.

69
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,560
So now that I've talked about
smell enough, I think, let's

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,030
talk about what makes an
aldehyde an aldehyde.

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,480
And you might even see
a pattern here.

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,510
In all of these aldehydes that
I've drawn, we have a carbon

73
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,760
double bonded to an oxygen.

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,800
   

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,990
And actually, this part of it
right here, and we'll see this

76
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,320
over and over again, this is
called a carbonyl group.

77
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,420
So that is a carbonyl group.

78
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,040
   

79
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,110
This right here is
a carbonyl group.

80
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,990
And you even see it over here.

81
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,140
But that by itself is
not the distinctive

82
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,060
feature of an aldehyde.

83
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,510
You'll see that in other
types of molecules.

84
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,180
Let me write it here.

85
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,710
Carbonyl.

86
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,120
What's distinctive about an
aldehyde is, attached to the

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
carbon in the carbonyl,
you have a hydrogen.

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,330
   

89
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,890
And sorry, I forgot to draw
this hydrogen here on

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,670
benzaldehyde.

91
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,260
You have a hydrogen here.

92
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,040
   

93
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,330
So, in general, an aldehyde
is something

94
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,230
that looks like this.

95
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,130
You have a carbonyl group.

96
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,870
You a carbonyl group.

97
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,520
You have a hydrogen, and then
you just have some other type

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,680
of carbon chain.

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,660
This right here is the simplest
possible aldehyde,

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,840
and actually, this chain
ends up being

101
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
just another hydrogen.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Now, these three that I've shown
right here, these are

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,740
their common names, and these
are the way that most people

104
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,460
will talk about formaldehyde,
benzaldehyde, or

105
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,830
cinnamaldehyde, so they're just
kind of good to know.

106
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,130
And I'll show you one more.

107
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,060
And this is a pretty
important one.

108
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,730
Let me do it down here so
we have some space.

109
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,430
So another one looks like this,
so bonded to a CH3 over

110
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,300
here and then a hydrogen.

111
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,550
This right here is called
acetaldehyde.

112
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,830
   

113
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,400
And I just wanted to expose
you to these common names

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,150
because this is what
people normally

115
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,120
use for these molecules.

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,440
Now, there is an IAPUC-- I
always forget the acronym.

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,470
There is a systematic
way to name them.

118
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,970
It's actually pretty
straightforward.

119
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,340
You just look at the longest
carbon chain, and you always

120
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,060
start numbering at the carbon
that's in the carbonyl group.

121
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,020
And it's always going to be at
the end of the chain because

122
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,080
that's always going to be
bonded to a hydrogen.

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,250
Actually, let me just
make clear that

124
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,550
this is also an aldehyde.

125
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,040
You have your carbonyl group,
and on one end, you have a

126
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,940
hydrogen, just like that.

127
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,610
Now, the systematic way of it,
you just look at the longest

128
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,270
carbon chain.

129
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,440
Over here, there's
just one carbon.

130
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,150
So here, you would call this,
the systematic name, you would

131
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,280
call this methanal,
not methanol.

132
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,940
Methanol would mean you would
have an OH group.

133
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,120
But since you have this double
bond and you have a hydrogen,

134
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,500
or you could say this double
bond is at the end of the

135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,520
carbon chain, this
is an aldehyde.

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,590
So the systematic name is
methanal, not methanol.

137
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,900
Let me make that clear.

138
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,120
This is methanal right there.

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,210
This one, I won't do
cinnamaldehyde or

140
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,330
benzaldehyde, because this is
really the only way that

141
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,690
people name them.

142
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,380
Actually, frankly, formaldehyde,
people never

143
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,640
call it methanal.

144
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,860
And acetaldehyde, they'll never
call it what I'm about

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,300
to name it, but the systematic
name is, the longest carbon

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,470
chain, you have one, two
carbons, so it is ethanol.

147
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,940
Ethanal, I don't want to
pronounce it incorrectly.

148
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,400
So let's do a couple more of
these, just to make sure we

149
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,840
have a decent understanding of
the systematic names here.

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,470
And in general, if you have
a really long chain, the

151
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,290
systematic names are
what is used.

152
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,000
So this thing right here,
what would you call it?

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,230
It's clearly an aldehyde.

154
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,060
You have a carbonyl group, a
hydrogen, and you have one,

155
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,440
two, three carbons.

156
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,930
So three carbons, the prefix
is prop-, so it's propanal.

157
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,270
It's an aldehyde.

158
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,542
If we want to do something
slightly more complicated,

159
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,080
let's do something like this.

160
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,570
What would this be called?

161
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,590
Let's see, we have one, two,
three, four, five.

162
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,960
We have five carbons.

163
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,470
So it will be pent-.

164
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,630
Penta-, and then it's
obviously an

165
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,180
aldehyde, so it's pentanal.

166
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,980
And you always assume that you
start numbering at the carbon

167
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,920
in the carbonyl group, so one,
two, three, four, five.

168
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,880
And on the two carbon, you
have a methyl group.

169
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,440
So this is 2-methyl.

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,100
So you have a methyl
group right here.

171
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,020
So this is going to be
2-methylpentanal.

172
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,999
