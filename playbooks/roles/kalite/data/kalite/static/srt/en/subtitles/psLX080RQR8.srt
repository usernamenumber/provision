1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
   

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,170
I've already made one video on
it, and at least it attempts

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,000
to give you the intuition behind
how the equilibrium

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,960
constant formula is derived
or where it comes from.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,610
From maybe the probabilities
of different molecules

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,220
interacting, if they're
in some small volume.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,700
But I think I was a little
hand wavy with it, and it

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,410
might not have been clear
how probabilities and

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,510
concentrations relate.

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,070
So what I thought I would do
in this video is kind of do

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,790
the same exercise, but do it
with real numbers and a real

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,760
reaction, so just a's,
b's and c's.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
So what I wrote here is
the Haber process.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,070
This is how we get ammonia in
the world and feed everyone.

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,830
Ammonia is a very important
fertilizer, but

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,670
that's beside the point.

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,480
The Haber process, which you
see right here, is in

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,740
equilibrium, which doesn't mean
that the concentrations

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,100
are the same.

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,780
In fact, this is an equilibrium
concentration that

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,380
I worked out before starting
this video.

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,540
Notice, the concentrations of
nitrogen and hydrogen are very

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,080
different than the concentration
of ammonia,

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
which is much less.

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,190
What equilibrium tells us is
that once we get to this

26
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,950
concentration of nitrogen and
hydrogen, the rate of reaction

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,720
of going in the rightward
direction is the same as the

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,180
rate of reaction of going in the
leftward direction, when

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,920
we have this much ammonia.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,510
So let's just think about what
that rate of reaction means.

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,360
And then I'll tell you
how I think about it.

32
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,770
At least how I think about it is
that if you have some small

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:29,560
volume-- Let's call that dV.

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,300
You could kind of arbitrarily
pick how small.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,570
So dV.

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,720
And the way it works in my head
is that if you pick some

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,890
small volume in this solution--
we don't know how

38
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,050
large of a solution we actually
have. We just have

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,230
the concentrations-- that in
this volume, you're just as

40
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,720
likely to have a reaction going
into that direction as

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,090
you are to have a reaction
going in

42
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,065
the backwards direction.

43
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:53,570
So let's think about what the
probability is of having a

44
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,660
reaction in this volume.

45
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,180
So the probability, let's say
of the forward reaction.

46
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:07,370
Probability of N2 plus
3H2, going in

47
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,820
this forward direction.

48
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,759
And whatever I do for this
direction, then you just have

49
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,590
to use the same logic for
the backward direction.

50
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,980
I just want to give you the
intuition that it's equal to

51
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,190
some constant related to
their concentration.

52
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:27,190
So the probability of going in
that direction to 2NH3 in our

53
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:34,300
little box, I claim-- and I
think this will hopefully make

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,320
some sense-- it's equal to
first, the probability that

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,700
they react given in the box.

56
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,650
So if you know that if you
have the constituent

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,000
particles, you have one nitrogen
molecule-- which has

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
two nitrogen atoms in it-- and
three hydrogen molecules.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,530
If you know you have those,
there's some probability that

60
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,010
they're going to react based
on their configurations and

61
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,940
their kinetic energy and how
they're approaching each other

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,740
and all of these different
types of things.

63
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,900
So this is the probability they
react given that they're

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,040
in this little box of dV.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,900
And then, of course, you're
going to have to multiply that

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,000
times the probability in the
box, that you have the

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,980
constituent particles
in the box.

68
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,520
Now, my claim is that
this piece right

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,770
here, this is a constant.

70
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,180
If you know at a certain
temperature, the Haber

71
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,600
process, these concentrations,
this would happen at 300

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,230
degrees Celsius-- I just
looked that up.

73
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,950
No need to memorize something
like this.

74
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,510
But equilibrium constants hold
at a certain temperature.

75
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,160
So I'm claiming that if I give
you a temperature-- say, 300

76
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,390
degrees Celsius-- and if I
tell you that I have one

77
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,040
nitrogen and three molecules of
hydrogen in your box, that

78
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,500
there's some constant
probability that they react.

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,770
I mean, it depends on their
configuration and all of that.

80
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,870
So I'll just call this the
constant-- I'll just make up a

81
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,200
constant probability, whatever
it is, or in the box.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,520
I could write anything there.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
So what we should be concerned
with is what is the

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,360
probability that we have those
four molecules-- three

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,190
molecules of hydrogen
and two molecules of

86
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,089
nitrogen-- in the box.

87
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,829
So this is equal to
some constant.

88
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,140
I'll call it the constant of
probability of react-- or let

89
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,420
me say react.

90
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,150
That's a good one: react.

91
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,710
The constant of reaction-- if
you have it in the box-- times

92
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,765
the probability that
they're in the box.

93
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,320
Let me draw the box.

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,390
So we want to know the
probability, where this box is

95
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,905
just some volume, that I have
three hydrogen molecules.

96
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:50,450
So one, two, three.

97
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,030
And one nitrogen molecule.

98
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,990
And we should pick a box that's
small enough so that

99
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,590
that would be indicative of how
close the molecules need

100
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,190
to get to actually react.

101
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,720
So I'm just going to pick my
dV to be-- I don't know.

102
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,680
Let's pick my dV to be-- I
looked up the diameter of an

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,240
ammonia molecule.

104
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,600
It was about 1/10
of a nanometer.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,190
   

106
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,950
If this was a nanometer box,
you could put 10 in each

107
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,500
direction, so you can almost fit
1,000 if you packed them

108
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,570
really tightly.

109
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,280
So let's make this half a
nanometer in each direction.

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,610
So if I pick my dV-- and
remember, I don't know if this

111
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,180
is the right distance.

112
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,630
I'm just trying to give you
the intuition behind the

113
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,180
equilibrium formula.

114
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,700
But if I pick this as being
0.5 nanometers by 0.5

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,770
nanometers by 0.5 nanometers,
what is my volume?

116
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,980
So my little volume is going
to be 0.5 times 10 to the

117
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,030
minus 1/9 meters-- that's a
nanometer-- to the third

118
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,550
power, because we're dealing
with cubic meters.

119
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,320
So this is equal to 0.5
to the 1/3 power.

120
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:09,750
That's what?

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:17,500
0.5 times 0.5 is 0.25
times 0.5 is 0.125.

122
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,490
I want to do the math right, so
let me just make sure I got

123
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,810
that right.

124
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,890
0.5 to the 1/3 power.

125
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:29,630
Right, 0.125 times-- negative
9 to the 1/3 power is minus

126
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,650
27-- 10 to the minus
27 meters cubed.

127
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,450
So that's my volume.

128
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,870
Now, we know the
concentration.

129
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,920
Let's figure out what's
the probability.

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,350
So this is the probability
in the box, right?

131
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,712
That's what we're concerned
with, the

132
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:45,190
probability in the box.

133
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,200
Well, the probability in the
box, that's the probability

134
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,980
that I have one hydrogen in the
box, times the probability

135
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,940
that I have another hydrogen
in the box, times the

136
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,490
probability that I have another
hydrogen in the box--

137
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,050
these are all in-the-box
probabilities-- times the

138
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,710
probability that I have
a nitrogen in the box.

139
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,430
I'll do the nitrogen in a
different color just to ease--

140
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,060
oh, I should've done these in
the orange because those are

141
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,750
the color of the molecules
up there.

142
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,640
And I'll do this
one in purple.

143
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,900
What's the probability of having
hydrogen in the box?

144
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,100
Well, we know hydrogen's
concentration at equilibrium

145
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,810
is 2 Molar.

146
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,740
So concentration of hydrogen,
we know hydrogen's

147
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:37,030
concentration is equal to 2
Molar, which is 2 Moles per

148
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,540
liter, which is equal to-- 2
Moles is just 2 times 6 times

149
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,820
10 to the twenty-third power--
Moles is just a number--

150
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,530
divided by liters.

151
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:56,760
So 1 liter is-- we could write
it in meters cubed, or we

152
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
could just make the
conversion.

153
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,730
Actually, let me just
do this for you.

154
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:06,200
1 liter is equal to 1 times 10
to the minus 3 meters cubed.

155
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,890
If you actually take a meter
cubed, you can actually put

156
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,480
1,000 liters in there.

157
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,720
So the other way you could say
this is 1 times 10 to the

158
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,560
minus 3 meters cubed, and then
if we want to figure out our

159
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,440
dV times-- how many dV's do
we have per meter cubed?

160
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,190
Or how many meter cubes
are their per dV?

161
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,760
So we know that already, so
it's 0.125 times 10 to the

162
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,620
minus 27 meters cubed per
our volume, right?

163
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,220
I just got that from up here,
that I have a small fraction

164
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,710
of a meter cubed
per my volume.

165
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,880
And now, I just have
to do some math.

166
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,940
So let's see, I can cancel out
some things first, because

167
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,116
there's a lot of
exponents here.

168
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:09,880
So let's see, if I take the
twenty-third-- so let me write

169
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,900
it out here.

170
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,540
So my hydrogen per box-- So my
concentration of hydrogen per

171
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:26,100
dV, is equal to 12 times
10-- whoops!

172
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,943
That's not helping when
my pen malfunctions.

173
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,260
Let me get that right.

174
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:39,220
12 times 10 to the twenty-third
power times 0.125

175
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,110
times 10 to the minus
twenty-seventh power.

176
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:47,060
All of that divided by 10
to the minus 3, right?

177
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,330
That's 1 times 10
to the minus 3.

178
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,690
So let's cancel out
some exponents.

179
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:55,840
If we get rid of the minus 3
here, you divide by minus 3,

180
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,180
then this becomes minus 24.

181
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,610
And then the minus 24 and the
minus-- so this is equal to--

182
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,720
what's 12 times 1.25?

183
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,150
So times 12 is equal to 1.5.

184
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,170
So the 12 times the 1.25 is
equal to 1.5 times-- and then

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,020
10 to the twenty-third times 10
to the minus twenty-fourth

186
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,790
is equal to 10 to the
minus 1, right?

187
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,740
So it's just divided by 10.

188
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,310
So on average, your
concentration of hydrogen in a

189
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,510
little cube that's half a
nanometer in each direction is

190
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:50,650
equal to 0.15 molecules-- not
Moles anymore-- of hydrogen

191
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,860
molecule per my little
dV, my little box.

192
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,590
And so this is a probability,
right?

193
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,160
This is a probability, because
obviously I can't have 0.15

194
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,480
molecules in every box.

195
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,270
This is just saying, on average,
there's a 0.15 chance

196
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,430
that I have a hydrogen
molecule in my box.

197
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,010
So if I want to go back here to
this, this is 0.15, this is

198
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,360
0.15, this is 0.15.

199
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,060
But how did we get this 0.15?

200
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:28,350
We multiplied the concentration
of hydrogen,

201
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,290
which was this right here.

202
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,910
That's the concentration of
the hydrogen-- I should've

203
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,140
written it in a more vibrant
color-- times just a bunch of

204
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,840
scaling factors, right?

205
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,170
We could just say that, well,
this was just equal to the

206
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,120
concentration of hydrogen times,
based on how I picked

207
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,520
my dV, I had to do all
of this scaling.

208
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,700
But it was times some constant
of scaling, scaling to my

209
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,250
appropriate factor.

210
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:00,000
So if we want to figure out each
of these, this is just

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,910
the concentration of hydrogen
times some scaling factor.

212
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,680
And this is going to
be the same thing.

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,300
We could do the same exercise
right here.

214
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,000
We figured out the exact value
with the hydrogen, but you

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,430
could do the same thing
with the nitrogen.

216
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,310
In fact, nitrogen's
concentration is just half of

217
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,630
the hydrogen, so we know it.

218
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,760
It's going to be half of that
0.15, so it's going to be

219
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,600
0.075, which is just equal to
the concentration of nitrogen

220
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,780
times some scaling factor.

221
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,600
It's actually going to be
the same scaling factor.

222
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,810
So let's go back to our
original problem.

223
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,590
So our probability that the
forward reaction is going to

224
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,520
occur in the box is going to be
equal to some probability

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,140
that is going to react-- given
that you're on the box, that's

226
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,870
some constant value-- times the
probability that they're

227
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,920
in the box.

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,030
And I'm making the claim that
that's equal to all of these

229
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,400
things multiplied
by each other.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,010
So that's the concentration of
hydrogen times some scaling

231
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,510
factor, some other scaling
factor-- I'll call it K sub

232
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,990
s-- times the concentration of
hydrogen times some scaling

233
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,440
factor, times the concentration
of hydrogen

234
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,230
times some scaling factor, times
the concentration of

235
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,390
nitrogen times some
scaling factor.

236
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,190
And what is that equal to?

237
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,890
Well, if you combine all the
constants, a bunch of scaling

238
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,590
constants times the constant
out here, that all just

239
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,310
becomes a constant.

240
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:31,640
So you get the probability of
the forward reaction in the

241
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,450
box is going to be equal to
just some constant-- let's

242
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,500
just call it constant
forward-- times the

243
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,780
concentration of the hydrogen
to the third power-- I

244
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,130
multiplied it three
times-- times the

245
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,820
concentration of nitrogen.

246
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,160
Now, if you wanted to go in
the reverse direction,

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,060
probability of reverse, you
could use the exact same

248
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,680
argument that I just used, and
I'm not going to do it just

249
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,760
for the sake of time, but
it'll be some constant.

250
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,790
This is the constant that the
ammonia will react in the

251
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,350
reverse direction on its own,
times the scaling factor, and

252
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,800
all of that.

253
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,690
But it's the same exact idea.

254
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,000
So, times the reverse, which is
just going to be-- How many

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Moles of ammonia do we have?

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,000
Or how many molecules?

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,090
What's its stoichiometric
coefficient?

258
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,100
It's 2.

259
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,860
So the reverse direction is
going to be concentration of

260
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,580
ammonia to the second power.

261
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,860
And when we're in equilibrium,
these two things, the

262
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,050
probability of having a forward
reaction in the box,

263
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,030
is going to be equal to the
probability of a reverse

264
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,490
reaction the box.

265
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,220
So these two things are going
to equal each other.

266
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,320
So this is going to equal-- if
I could just copy and paste

267
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,640
it-- that up there.

268
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,690
   

269
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,990
There you go.

270
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,740
Then if you set the constants
equal to each other, and then

271
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,700
you could pick what the-- you
normally put the products on

272
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,130
the right-hand side
of the equation.

273
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,620
So I'll take these and divide
them into this, and I'll

274
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:14,970
divide that into that, and
you're left with KF/KR is

275
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:23,540
equal to the concentration of
ammonia to the second power,

276
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,080
divided by the concentration
of hydrogen to the third

277
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,730
power, times the concentration
of nitrogen.

278
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,310
And you could call that the
equilibrium constant.

279
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,100
And there you have it.

280
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,130
A pseudo-derived formula for
the equilibrium constant.

281
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,790
It's all, at least in my mind,
coming from common sense, from

282
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,490
the probability that if you have
a small volume, things

283
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,690
are actually going to react.

284
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,267
