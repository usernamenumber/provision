00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:01,239
What I want to do in this video

2
00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:02,336
is to try to get a good understand

3
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,667
of how the U.S. Federal Income Tax Rate Schedule works

4
00:00:05,667 --> 00:00:06,624
and also what people mean

5
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:08,569
when they say, "tax brackets",

6
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:11,086
or what does it mean to be in a "tax bracket"?

7
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:14,346
So let's say that I make $100,000,

8
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,563
and I'm single and I'm not going to go

9
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:17,882
into the deductions or anything fancy like that.

10
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:23,145
So let's say I make $100,000 in a given year,

11
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:25,557
and these numbers will change as the tax code changes,

12
00:00:25,557 --> 00:00:28,026
but the general idea is the same thing,

13
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,097
although the details might change.

14
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,272
So the way the rate schedule works

15
00:00:32,272 --> 00:00:37,604
is that the first $8,350 of my $100,000

16
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,926
will be taxed at 10%.

17
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:43,740
So the first $8,350 will be taxed at 10%,

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,540
so I'll be paying, well that's pretty easy to calculate,

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,650
$835 [in taxes] on that first $8,350.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,227
Now the next $25,600,

21
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:02,611
or from $8,350 to $33,950,

22
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,710
that will be taxed at 15%.

23
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,213
So this amount right over here,

24
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:12,732
I will have to pay 15% on that.

25
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:17,871
So the difference between $33,950 and $8,350

26
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,321
is $25,600.

27
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:27,545
$25,600 x 15%. I'll calculate it all at the end

28
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,440
using a calculator.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,534
Now, the next $48,300

30
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,964
is going to be taxed at 25%.

31
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:38,745
So let me draw that over here.

32
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:44,926
This next piece is going to be taxed at 25%.

33
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:46,329
So this is the difference between

34
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:51,973
$82,250 and $33,950, that's $48,300,

35
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:57,512
so it's going to be $48,300 x 25%.

36
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:59,243
And then finally, the remainder,

37
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,953
the amount above $82,250,

38
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:03,663
since I don't get into the next bracket above that,

39
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:04,776
this part right here

40
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,773
is going to be taxed at 28%.

41
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:09,717
So this part right over here

42
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:11,831
is going to be taxed at 28%.

43
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,912
Let me get my trusty calculator out

44
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:16,438
to figure out what that is.

45
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,295
So if that's going to be taxed at --

46
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:22,459
so the difference between $100,000 and $82,250.

47
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:35,408
So $100,000 - $82,250 = $17,750

48
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:43,179
So it is $17,750 x 28%,

49
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:44,533
and now I can use the calculator

50
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,877
to calculate all of these.

51
00:02:46,877 --> 00:02:47,779
So it's going to be,

52
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:48,883
let's do it all at once,

53
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:58,100
$17,750 x 28%

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,429
plus

55
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:08,493
$48,300 x 25%

56
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:09,369
plus

57
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:17,104
$25,600 x 15%

58
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:22,428
finally, plus $835.

59
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:26,907
I'm going to pay $21,720.

60
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,996
So the sum of all of these --

61
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:37,604
in total, I'm going to pay $21,720.

62
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:38,017
And I want to make sure that

63
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:38,630
you don't have the misconception -

64
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,493
notice, you only pay the 28%

65
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:42,894
on the incremental amount,

66
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,202
when you enter that bracket,

67
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:45,856
you don't pay this 28%

68
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:48,232
on the entire $100,000,

69
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:51,100
just on the increment above $82,250,

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,687
you don't pay the 25% on the entire amount,

71
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:56,295
just on the increment between $32,950 and $82,250.

72
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:01,434
