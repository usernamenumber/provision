1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,030
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,460
We are now on section four of our third test,

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,040
and so we're on page 530.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,060
And let's start with problem number one.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,450
If s plus t is equal to 3,

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:23,030
what is the value of s plus t minus 6?

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,260
Well,we know that s plus t is equal to 3,

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,020
so they're just asking us what is 3 minus 6.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,060
Well 3 minus 6 is minus 3.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,030
And that is choice A.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,040
Number two.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,010
They have a box on the cube.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,570
Let me see if I can draw this box.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:52,400
So it looks like,and then the back side's like this,

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,460
and then let me draw a little dotted--

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,880
And then the sides are A--

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:17,020
let me do that in a different color--A,B,C,D,E,P,and Q.

18
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,490
And they say,on the cube in the figure above,

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,300
each of the following points is the same distance from

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,000
P as it is from Q except?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,050
And these are all the choices.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,050
A, B, C, D, and E.

23
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,090
So we want to look for a point that isn't the same distance

24
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,730
from P as it is from Q.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,060
A is one edge from P and one edge from Q,so it's not A.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,000
B is two edges from P no matter how you go.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,500
And it is also two edges from Q no matter how you go,

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,040
so it's not B.

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,410
C is one edge from Q,

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,390
but to get to P you gotta go at least three edges.

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,360
1, 2, 3, to go to C. So it's going to be C.

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,480
C is much closer to Q than it is to P,

33
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,000
so it is not the same distance.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,010
So our choice is C.C is C.All right.

35
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,040
Problem number three.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,010
And I'll switch to a less tacky color.

37
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,090
Problem number three.

38
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,080
Oh boy,there's all sorts of stuff to draw.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,390
Maybe I won't draw it.

40
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's see if I can get by without drawing.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,020
The bar graph above shows

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,040
where fraud is committed on the internet.

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,130
Which of the following circle graphs

44
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,030
most accurately displays the same graph?

45
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,020
Well I'll try it.So they say websites.

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,000
Websites is this huge number.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Websites,that's 78%.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,040
Let me say that that is this purple color.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,060
Actually I should do this with the rectangle too.

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,820
The websites is a purple color,

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:05,530
and then let's say that email is,

52
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,050
well I'll do it this color,at 18%.

53
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:18,430
And then they tell us that news groups is 2%,

54
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,010
so it's a really small percentage,2%.

55
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:35,000
And then finally,they tell us that other is also 2%.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,080
And then you want to see a pie graph that's the same thing.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,000
So if this is the pie graph.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,030
So 78% is going to be this purple,

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,010
it's going to be websites.

60
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,560
So that's a little bit more than 3/4,right?

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,040
78% is 3% more than 3/4.3/4 would look like this.

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,920
A little bit more than 3/4

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,010
is going to look something like this.

64
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,380
But a little bit more than 3/4

65
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,010
is going to look something like this.

66
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,030
And then I can actually even fill it.

67
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,040
That's going to be a little bit more than 3/4.

68
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,060
And then the blue stuff,18%,

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:29,020
that's going to look something like 18%.

70
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,000
That's a little less than 25%,so it's going to be like that.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,050
So we could fill that too.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,180
The other pieces are going to be

73
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:54,030
these thin slivers like this,2% and 2%.

74
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,020
This is really just translating that into this.

75
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,000
And they're actually going to be even thinner

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,090
than the way I drew it.

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,460
And out of all the choices,

78
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,520
the one that has this purple region,

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,050
websites,the dark region on the graph.

80
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,730
The only one that has that,where it's more than 3/4,

81
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,010
are choices C and D,right?

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,190
That's the only one where it has more than 75%

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,690
is shaded the websites' color.

84
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,060
It's either going to be C or D.

85
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,060
And then when you look at the difference between C and D,

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,080
choice C has nothing for other in there.

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Choice C just has news groups, no other.

88
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,530
So it has to be D,

89
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,010
because news groups and other are actually same size.

90
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,060
So they should be the same proportions.

91
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,060
So the choice is D.

92
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,080
Next problem.

93
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,090
Problem number four.

94
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,940
The numerator of a certain fraction is

95
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,040
5 less than the denominator.

96
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,080
So let's say that the denominator is x.

97
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,430
The numerator is 5 less than the denominator,

98
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,590
so the numerator is x minus 5.

99
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,020
The numerator is 5 less than the denominator.

100
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,080
And they say the fraction is equal to 3/4.

101
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,010
What is the denominator of this fraction?

102
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,000
So we just solve for x.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,050
So let's cross multiply.

104
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:22,050
x times 3,so 3x,is equal 4 times x minus 5.

105
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:29,020
So 3x is equal to 4x minus 20.

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,090
And you can subtract.

107
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,520
So you get 20 is equal to,subtract 3x from both sides,

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,020
is equal to x,and that's the denominator.

109
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,080
So that is choice D.

110
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,010
The next problem has a bunch of drawing for me to do.

111
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's see if I can finish it in time.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,680
So we have the two axes.

113
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,020
Let me draw the two axes.

114
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,000
This is a big problem, so I'll draw it big.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,060
I've got the two axes, and then it goes from k to 6k.

116
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:15,050
k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 5k, 6k.

117
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,040
6k, 5k, 4k, 3k,you get the point.

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,020
And then it goes from 1 to 6.

119
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:28,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

120
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,430
And then the triangle looks like it goes from--

121
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,630
if I were to draw a line--

122
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,060
it goes from 2k to 6k,and then from 2 to 6.

123
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,020
They actually draw the line like this,2k it is.

124
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,380
This is a triangle.

125
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,850
I don't know if I'll have time to do it in this video,

126
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,020
but everything should work out.

127
00:07:50,020 --> 00:08:02,000
The triangle goes from 2k to 5k,good thing I caught that,

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,040
and it's at point 2.

129
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,020
That's its base.

130
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,040
And then it goes up to 6,where it kind of is in the middle.

131
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,010
It goes up to here.

132
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,590
This is what the triangle looks like.

133
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,090
I have redrawn the problem.

134
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,010
And this is B, A, C.

135
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,030
And they say,in the figure above,the scale on the x-axis

136
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,020
is different from the scale on the y-axis.

137
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:41,050
If the area of triangle ABC is 18,what is the value of k?

138
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,020
The area is 18.

139
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,090
So area is equal to 1/2 base times height for a triangle.

140
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,590
We know that the area is 18.

141
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,080
So 18 is equal to 1/2.

142
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,020
What's the base?

143
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,070
Well we went from 2k to 5k.

144
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,000
So we went 3k.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,070
We went 1, 2, 3. We went 3k.

146
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,040
So the base is 3k.

147
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,020
And what's the height?Well from 2 to 6.

148
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,050
So the height is 4, and we just saw solve for k.

149
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:20,030
So 18 is equal to 1/2 times 4 is 2 times 3k is equal to 6k.

150
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,080
k is equal to 3.

151
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,020
And that is choice E. And we are done.

152
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,920
You just have to know area is equal to 1/2 base times height

153
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,710
and then just put in the base, which is 3k,

154
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,480
and the height, and solve for k.

155
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,020
I'll see you in the next video.
