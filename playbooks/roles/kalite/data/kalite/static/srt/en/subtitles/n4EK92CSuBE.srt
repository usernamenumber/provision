1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,120
Let's

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,600
say I have the indefinite
integral 1 over the square

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,840
root of 3 minus 2x squared.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,730
Of course I have a dx there.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,600
So right when I look at
that, there's no obvious

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,240
traditional method of
taking this antiderivative.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,510
I don't have the derivative of
this sitting someplace else in

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,830
the integral, so I can't do
traditional u-substitution.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,560
But what I can do is I could
say, well, this almost looks

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,680
like some trig identities that
I'm familiar with, so maybe I

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,610
can substitute with
trig functions.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,740
So let's see if I can find
a trig identity that

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,280
looks similar to this.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,830
Well, our most basic
trigonometric identity-- this

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,100
comes from the unit circle
definition-- is that the sine

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,080
squared of theta plus
the cosine squared of

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,040
theta is equal to 1.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,380
And then if we subtract cosine
squared of theta from both

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,510
sides, we get-- or if we
subtract sine squared of theta

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,220
from both sides, we could do
either-- we could get cosine

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,310
squared of theta is equal to 1
minus sine squared of theta.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,460
We could do either way.

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,790
But this, all of a sudden, this
thing right here, starts to

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,230
look a little bit like this.

25
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,790
Maybe I can do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation to make

26
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,580
this look a lot like that.

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,540
So the first thing, I would
like to have a 1 here-- at

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,090
least, that's how my brain
works-- so let's factor out a

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,420
3 out of this denominator.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,630
So this is the same thing as
the integral of 1 over the

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,920
square root of-- let me factor
out a 3 out of this expression.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,690
3 times 1 minus 2/3x squared.

33
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,900
I did nothing fancy here.

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,890
I just factored the 3
out of this expression,

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,250
that's all I did.

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,130
But the neat thing now is,
this expression looks a

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,650
lot like that expression.

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,310
In fact, if I substitute, if I
say that this thing right here,

39
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,490
this 2/3x squared, if I set it
equal to sine squared theta, I

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,250
will be able to use
this identity.

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,450
So let's do that.

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,130
Let's set 2/3x squared, let's
set that equal to sine

43
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,590
squared of theta.

44
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,210
So if we take the square root
of both sides of this equation,

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,730
I get the square root of 2 over
the square root of 3 times x is

46
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,910
equal to the sine of theta.

47
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,600
If I want to solve for
x, what do I get?

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,870
And, well, we're going to
have to solve for both

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,600
x and for theta, so
let's do it both ways.

50
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,390
First, let's solve for theta.

51
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,430
If we solve for theta, you get
that theta is equal to the

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,500
arcsine, or the inverse sine,
of square root of 2 over

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,820
square root of 3x.

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,300
That's if you solve for theta.

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,380
Now, if you solve for x, you
just multiply both sides of

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,940
this equation times the inverse
of this and you get x is equal

57
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,650
to-- divide both sides of the
equation by this or multiply it

58
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,180
by the inverse-- is equal to
the square root of 3 over the

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,230
square root of 2 times
the sine of theta.

60
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,060
And we were going to substitute
this with sine squared of

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,410
theta, but we can't leave
this dx out there.

62
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,560
So the derivative of x with
respect to theta is equal to

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,690
square root of 3 over
square root of 2.

64
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,170
Derivative of this with respect
to theta is just cosine of

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,340
theta, and if we want to write
this in terms of dx, we could

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,490
just write that dx is equal to
square root of 3 over the

67
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:46,370
square root of 2 cosine
of theta d theta.

68
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,870
Now we're ready to substitute.

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,660
So we can rewrite this
expression up here-- I'll do it

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,360
in this reddish color-- I was
using that, let me do

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,770
it in the blue color.

72
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,650
We can rewrite this
expression up here now.

73
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,610
It's an indefinite integral
of-- dx is on the

74
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,600
numerator, right?

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,330
Instead of writing this 1
times dx, I could have

76
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,050
just written a dx up here.

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,750
That could be a dx
just like that.

78
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,800
You're just multiplying
it times dx.

79
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,990
So what's dx?

80
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,880
dx is this business.

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,070
I'll do it in yellow.

82
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,950
dx is this right here.

83
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,560
So it's the square root of
3 over the square root of

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,250
2 cosine theta d theta.

85
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,160
That's what dx was.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,250
Now, the denominator in my
equation, I have the square

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,580
root of 3 times--
now it's 1 minus.

88
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,053
Now I said 2/3x squared is
equal to sine squared of theta.

89
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:47,640
93
00:04:47,64 --> 00:04:49,75
Now how can I simplify this?

90
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,960
Well, what's 1 minus
sine squared of theta?

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,480
That's cosine squared of theta.

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,670
So this thing right here is
cosine squared of theta.

93
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,010
So my indefinite integral
becomes the square root of 3

94
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,030
over the square root of 2
cosine theta d theta, all of

95
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:18,340
that over the square root of
3 times the cosine

96
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,570
squared of theta.

97
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,900
That just became cosine
squared of theta.

98
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,890
So let's just take the square
root of this bottom part.

99
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,380
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll do an arbitrary

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,670
change of colors-- square root
of 3 over the square root of 2

101
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,890
cosine of theta d theta, all of
that over-- what's the

102
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,420
square root of this?

103
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,230
It's equal to the square root
of 3 times the square root

104
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,730
of cosine squared, so
times cosine of theta.

105
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,200
Now, this simplifies
things a good bit.

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,110
I have a cosine of theta
divided by a cosine of theta,

107
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,150
those cancel out, so we'll just
get 1, and then I have a square

108
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,150
root of 3 up here divided by a
square root of 3, so those two

109
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,860
guys are going to cancel out,
so my integral simplifies

110
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,730
nicely to 1 over square
root of 2 d theta.

111
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,530
Or even better, I could write
this-- this is just a constant

112
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,460
term, I could take it out of my
integral-- it equals 1 over the

113
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,140
square root of 2 times my
integral of just d theta.

114
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,800
And this is super easy.

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,570
This is equal to 1 over
the square root of 2

116
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,590
times theta plus c.

117
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,900
Plus some constant.

118
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,760
I mean, you could say that the
integral of this is theta plus

119
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,830
c and then you'd multiply the
constant times this, but it's

120
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,950
still going to be some
arbitrary constant.

121
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,320
I think you know how to take
the antiderivative of this.

122
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,630
But are we done?

123
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,210
Well, no.

124
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,420
We want to know our indefinite
integral in terms of x.

125
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,280
So now we have to
reverse substitute.

126
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,960
So what is theta?

127
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,900
We figured that out here. theta
is equal to arcsine the square

128
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,810
root of 2 over the
square root of 3x.

129
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,840
So our original indefinite
integral, which was all of this

130
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,180
silliness up here, now that I
reverse substitute for theta or

131
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,140
put x back in there, it's 1
over the square root

132
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,890
of 2 times theta.

133
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:12,980
theta is just this, is just
arcsine of square root of 2

134
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,530
over square root of 3 x, and
then I have this constant

135
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,600
out here, plus c.

136
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,230
So this right here is
the antiderivative of

137
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,800
1 over the square root
of 3 minus 2x squared.

138
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,840
So hopefully you
found that helpful.

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,690
I'm going to do a couple of
more videos where we go through

140
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,350
a bunch of these examples,
just so that you get

141
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,220
familiar with them.

142
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,533
