1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,280
Let's now do another triple
integral, and in this one I

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,300
won't actually evaluate
the triple integral.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,860
But what we'll do is we'll
define the triple integral.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,310
We're going to something
similar that we did in the

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,500
second video where we
figured out the mass

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,670
using a density function.

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,380
But what I want to do in this
video is show you how to set

9
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,010
the boundaries when the
figure is a little

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,010
bit more complicated.

11
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,350
And if we have time we'll try
to do it where we change

12
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,470
the order of integration.

13
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,090
So let's say I have the surface
-- let me just make something

14
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:39,340
up -- 2x plus 3z plus
y is equal to 6.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,516
Let's draw that surface.

16
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:43,070
It looks something like this.

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,720
This will be my x-axis.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,580
This is going to be my z-axis.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,860
This is going to be my y-axis.

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,910
   

21
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,694
Draw them out.

22
00:00:56,694 --> 00:00:59,990
x, y and z.

23
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,600
And I care about the surface in
the kind of positive octant,

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,970
right, because when you're
dealing with three-dimensionals

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,840
we have, instead of four
quadrants we have

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,380
eight octants.

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,280
But we want the octant where
all x, y and z is positive,

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,780
which is the one I drew here.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,740
So let's see, let me draw some
-- what is the x-intercept?

30
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,440
When y and z are 0,
so we'll write here,

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,860
that's the x-intercept.

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,880
2x is equal to 6, so
x is equal to 3.

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,070
So 1, 2, 3.

34
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,910
So that's the x-intercept.

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,880
The y-intercept when x and
z are 0 are on the y-axis,

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,470
so y will be equal to 6.

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:41,000
so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 is the y-intercept.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,160
Then finally the z-intercept
when x and y are 0

39
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,140
we're on the z-axis.

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,620
3z will be equal to 6.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,240
So z is equal to 1, 2.

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,880
So the figure that I care about
will look something like

43
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,730
this -- it's be this
inclined surface.

44
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,150
It will look
something like that.

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,740
In this positive octant.

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,070
So this is the surface
defined by this function.

47
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,545
Let's say that I care about
the volume, and I'm going

48
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,540
to make it a little
bit more complicated.

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,320
We could say oh, well this
was a volume between the

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,170
surface and the xy plane.

51
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,710
But I'm going to make it a
little bit more complicated.

52
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:24,440
Let's say the volume above
this surface, and the

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,530
surface z is equal to 2.

54
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,830
So the volume we care
about is going to look

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,690
something like this.

56
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,345
Let me see if I can
pull off drawing this.

57
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:46,130
If we go up 2 here -- let me
draw the top in a different

58
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,430
color, let me draw
the top in green.

59
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,530
So this is along the zy plane.

60
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,270
And then the other
edge is going to look

61
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,636
something like this.

62
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:02,110
Let me make sure I can draw it
-- this is the hardest part.

63
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,350
We'll go up 2 here, and this
is along the zx plane.

64
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,970
   

65
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,930
And we'd have another line
connecting these two.

66
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,740
   

67
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,150
So this green triangle,
this is part of the

68
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,180
plane z is equal to 2.

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,700
   

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,450
The volume we care about is the
volume between this top green

71
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,540
plane and this tilted plane
defined by 2x plus 3z

72
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,100
plus y is equal to 6.

73
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,530
So this area in between.

74
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,780
Let me see if I can make
it a little bit clearer.

75
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,750
Because the visualization, as I
say, is often the hardest part.

76
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,590
So we'd have kind of a front
wall here, and then the back

77
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,660
wall would be this wall back
here, and then there'd

78
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,020
be another wall here.

79
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,250
And then the base of it, the
base I'll do in magenta

80
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,330
will be this plane.

81
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,140
So the base is that plane
-- that's the bottom part.

82
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,190
Anyway, I don't know if I
should have made it that messy

83
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,120
because we're going to have to
draw dv's and d volumes on it.

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,830
But anyway, let's try our best.

85
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,130
So, if we're going to figure
out the volume -- and actually,

86
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,230
since we're doing a triple
integral and we want to show

87
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,630
that we have to do the triple
integral, instead of doing a

88
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,730
volume, let's do the mass of
something of variable density.

89
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,700
So let's say the density in
this volume that we care about,

90
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,240
the density function is a
function of x, y and z.

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,220
It can be anything.

92
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,770
That's not the point of what
I'm trying to teach here.

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,860
But I'll just define something.

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,820
Let's say it's x squared yz.

95
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,080
Our focus is really just
to set up the integrals.

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,130
So the first thing I like to do
is I visualize -- what we're

97
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,080
going to do is we're going to
set up a little cube in the

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,410
volume under consideration.

99
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,750
So if I had a -- let me do it
in a bold color so that you can

100
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,565
see it -- so if I have a cube
-- maybe I'll do it in brown,

101
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:53,400
it's not as bold but it's
different enough from

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,590
the other colors.

103
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,810
So if I had a little cube
here in the volume under

104
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,480
consideration, that's a little
cube -- you consider that dv.

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,840
The volume of that cube is kind
of a volume differential.

106
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,470
And that is equal to dx --
no, sorry, this is dy.

107
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,760
Let me do this in yellow,
or green even better.

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,820
So dy, which is this.

109
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,370
dy times dx, dx times dz.

110
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,420
That's the volume of
that little cube.

111
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,520
And if we wanted to know the
mass of that cube, we would

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,650
multiply the density function
at that point times this dv.

113
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,810
So the mass, you could call
it d -- I don't know, dm.

114
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,270
The mass differential is going
to be equal to that times that.

115
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,230
So x squared y z times this.

116
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,610
dy, dx, and dz.

117
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,850
And we normally switch this
order around, depending on what

118
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,650
we're going to integrate with
respect to first so we

119
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,910
don't get confused.

120
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,210
So let's try to do this.

121
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,430
Let's try to set
up this integral.

122
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,900
So let's do it traditionally.

123
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,250
The last couple of triple
integrals we did we integrated

124
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,770
with respect to z first.

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,580
So let's do that.

126
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,155
So we're going to integrate
with respect to z first. so

127
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:11,750
we're going to take this cube
and we're going to sum up all

128
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,280
of the cubes in the z-axis.

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,130
So going up and
down first, right?

130
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,500
So if we do that, what
is the bottom boundary?

131
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,430
   

132
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,890
So when you sum up up and down,
these cubes are going to

133
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,460
turn to columns, right?

134
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,620
So what is the bottom of the
column, the bottom bound?

135
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,700
What's the surface?

136
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,970
It's the surface
defined right here.

137
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,740
So, if we want that bottom
bound defined in terms of

138
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,800
z, we just have to solve
this in terms of z.

139
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,880
So let's subtract.

140
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,950
So what do we get.

141
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,210
If we want this defined in
terms of z, we get 3z is

142
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,160
equal to 6 minus 2x minus y.

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,900
Or z is equal 2 minus
2/3x minus y over 3.

144
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,380
This is the same thing as that.

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,385
But when we're talking about
z, explicitly defining a

146
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:05,070
z, this is how we get it,
algebraically manipulated.

147
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,740
So the bottom boundary -- and
you can visualize it, right?

148
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,670
The bottom of these columns
are going to go up and down.

149
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,490
We're going to add up all
the columns in up and

150
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,200
down direction, right?

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,680
You can imagine summing them.

152
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,020
The bottom boundary is
going to be this surface.

153
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,860
z is equal to 2 minus
2/3x minus y over 3.

154
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,840
And then what's
the upper bound?

155
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,440
Well, the top of the column
is going to be this green

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,610
plane, and what did we
say the green plane was?

157
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,110
It was z is equal to 2.

158
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,130
   

159
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,890
That's this plane, this
surface right here.

160
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,970
Z is equal to 2.

161
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,690
And, of course, what is the
volume of that column?

162
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:49,500
Well, it's going to be the
density function, x squared yz

163
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,820
times the volume differential,
but we're integrating

164
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,005
with respect to z first.

165
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:57,020
Let me write dz there.

166
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,950
I don't know, let's say we want
to integrate with respect to --

167
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,450
I don't know, we want to
integrate with respect

168
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,540
to x for next.

169
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,030
In the last couple of
videos, I integrated

170
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,930
with respect to y next.

171
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,880
So let's do x just to show you
it really doesn't matter.

172
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,650
So we're going to integrate
with respect to x.

173
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,760
So, now we have these
columns, right?

174
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,920
When we integrate with respect
to z, we get the volume of each

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,060
of these columns wher the
top boundary is that plane.

176
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,220
Let's see if I can
draw it decently.

177
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,570
The top boundary is that plane.

178
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,810
The bottom boundary
is this surface.

179
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,560
Now we want to integrate
with respect to x.

180
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,720
So we're going to add
up all of the dx's.

181
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,620
So what is the bottom
boundary for the x's?

182
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Well, this surface is defined
all the way to -- the volume

183
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,590
under question is defined all
the way until x is equal to 0.

184
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,110
And if you get confused, and
it's not that difficult to get

185
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,260
confused when you're imagining
these three-dimensional things,

186
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,910
say you know what, we already
integrated with respect to z.

187
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,530
The two variables I
have left are x and y.

188
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,530
Let me draw the projection of
our volume onto the xy plane,

189
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,300
and what does that look like?

190
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,350
So I will do that.

191
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,900
Because that actually does
help simplify things.

192
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,550
So if we twist it, if we take
this y and flip it out like

193
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,570
that, and x like that we'll get
in kind of the traditional way

194
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,664
that we learned when we
first learned algebra.

195
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:15,600
The xy-axis.

196
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,745
   

197
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:21,900
So this is x, this is y.

198
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,510
And this point is what?

199
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,300
Or this point?

200
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,660
What is that?

201
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,060
That's x is equal to 3.

202
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,710
So it's 1, 2, 3.

203
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,600
That's x is equal to 3.

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,930
And this point right here
is y is equal to 6.

205
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,200
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

206
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,900
So on the xy-axis, kind of the
domain -- you can view it that

207
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,360
-- looks something like that.

208
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,540
So one way to think about it is
we've figured out if these

209
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,000
columns -- we've integrated
up/down or along the z-axis.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,790
But when you view it looking
straight down onto it, you're

211
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,350
looking on the xy plane, each
of our columns are going to

212
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,100
look like this where the
column's going to pop out out

213
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,320
of your screen in
the z direction.

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,760
But the base of each column is
going to dx like that, and

215
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,040
then dy up and down, right?

216
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,800
So we decided to integrate
with respect to x next.

217
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,520
So we're going to add up each
of those columns in the

218
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,860
x direction, in the
horizontal direction.

219
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,140
So the question was what
is the bottom boundary?

220
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,880
What is the lower bound
in the x direction?

221
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,680
Well, it's x is equal to 0.

222
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,400
If there was a line here, then
it would be that line probably

223
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,740
as a function of y, or
definitely as a function of y.

224
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,800
So our bottom bound here
is x is equal to 0.

225
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,620
What's our top bound?

226
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,340
I realize I'm already pushing.

227
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,490
Well, our top bound is this
relation, but it has to

228
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,100
be in terms of x, right?

229
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,980
So what is this relation.

230
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,230
So, you could view it as kind
of saying well, if z is equal

231
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,840
to 0, what is this line?

232
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,770
What is this line right here?

233
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,910
So z is equal to 0.

234
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,390
We have 2x plus y
is equal to 6.

235
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,590
We want the relationship
in terms of x.

236
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,130
So we get 2x is equal to 6
minus y where x is equal

237
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,220
to 3 minus y over 2.

238
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,130
   

239
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,500
And then finally we're going to
integrate with respect to y.

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,130
And this is the easy part.

241
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,530
So we've integrated up and
down to get a column.

242
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,150
These are the bases of the
column, so we've integrated

243
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,000
in the x direction.

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
Now we just have to go up and
down with respect to y, or in

245
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,350
the xy plane with respect to y.

246
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,970
So what is the y
bottom boundary?

247
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,060
Well, it's 0.

248
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,650
y is equal to 0.

249
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,660
And the top boundary
is y is equal to 6.

250
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,540
And there you have it.

251
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,730
We have set up the integral
and now it's just a matter

252
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,590
of chugging through
it mechanically.

253
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,120
But I've run out of time
and I don't want this

254
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,660
video to get rejected.

255
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,870
So I'll leave you there.

256
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,760
See you in the next video.
