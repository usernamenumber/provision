1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,642
Right now, the best estimate of when the Big Bang occurred -

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:08,661
and once again, I don't like the term that much, 'cause it kind of implies

3
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:12,562
some type of explosion, but what it really is is kind of an expansion of space

4
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:16,067
- when space really started to expand from a singularity

5
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:18,924
but our best estimate of when this occurred is

6
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:25,267
13.7 billion years ago, and even though we're used to

7
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:28,584
dealing with numbers in the billions, especially when we talk about

8
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:31,867
large amounts of money and whatnot, this is an unbelievable amount

9
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,575
of time. It seems like something that is tractable, but

10
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,841
it really isn't. And in future videos, I'm actually going

11
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,933
to talk about the time scales, so you can really appreciate

12
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,934
how long, or even start to appreciate, or appreciate

13
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:47,267
that we CAN'T appreciate how long 13.7 billion years is.

14
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:50,600
And I also want to emphasize that this is

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,522
the current best estimate. Even in my life time, even in

16
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:56,402
my life time that I actually new about the big bang and

17
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:58,600
that I would pay attention to what the best estimate was,

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,442
this number's been moving around, so I suspect

19
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:03,181
that in the future, this number might become more accurate

20
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:05,271
or might move arround some.

21
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,779
But this is our best guess. Now, with that said, I want

22
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,267
to think about what this tells us about the size

23
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:13,373
of the observable universe.

24
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:23,548
So, if all of the expansion started 13.7 billion years ago...

25
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:28,333
[and] all of everything we know in our 3 dimensional universe

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,933
was in a single point,

27
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,925
the longest that any photon of light could be traveling

28
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,271
that's reaching us right now...

29
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,593
(so, our eye is right...)

30
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,915
(so, let's say that's my eye right over there)

31
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,516
(that's my eyelashes, just like that)

32
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,281
the longest - so, some photon of light,

33
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,950
is just getting to my eye, or maybe

34
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,400
it's just getting to the lense of a telescope -

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,718
the longest that that could have been traveling

36
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:55,902
is 13.7 billion years.

37
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,498
So when we looked at that depiction

38
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:11,267
(this, I think, was 2 or 3 videos ago)

39
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:12,841
of the observable universe,

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,117
I drew - it was a circle.

41
00:02:15,117 --> 00:02:17,764
It was this circle.

42
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:21,108
And, when we see light coming from these

43
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,771
remote objects, that light is getting to us right here

44
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:26,200
this is where we are. This is where, I guess,

45
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,863
in the depiction, the remote object was,

46
00:02:28,863 --> 00:02:32,532
but the light from that remote object is just now getting to us.

47
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:38,656
And that light took 13.7 billion years to get to us.

48
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:45,489
Now, what I'm going to hesitate to do,

49
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,533
because we're talking over such large distances

50
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,533
and such large time scales ...over which

51
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:55,380
space itself is expanding, we're going to see

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,691
that you cannot say that this object over here -

53
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:02,744
this is not necessarily...

54
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,906
this is NOT

55
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:04,744
(I'll put it in caps.)

56
00:03:04,744 --> 00:03:13,538
This is NOT 13.7 billion light years away!

57
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:16,125
If we're talking about smaller time scales,

58
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,043
or, I guess, smaller distances,

59
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,892
you could say aproximately that.

60
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:21,868
The expansion of the universe itself

61
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,285
would not make as much of a difference.

62
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,854
And let me make it even more clear.

63
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,709
I'm talking about an object over there,

64
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,867
but we can even talk about that coordinate in space.

65
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:34,127
And that coordinate in (and actually I should say,

66
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,722
"That coordinate in space-time."

67
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:37,533
'Cause we're viewing it at a certain instant as well.)

68
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:43,121
But that coordinate is not 13.7 billion light-years

69
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,700
away from our current coordinate.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,464
And there are a couple of reasons to think about it.

71
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:47,533
First of all, think about it.

72
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,533
That light was emmitted 13.7 billion years ago.

73
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:55,845
When that light was emmitted, we were much closer to that coordinate.

74
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:57,842
This coordinate was much closer to that.

75
00:03:57,842 --> 00:03:59,189
Where we are in the universe now

76
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,371
was much closer to that point in the universe.

77
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,933
The other thing to think about is, as this - let me actually draw it.

78
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:12,017
So let's say that - let's go three hundred thousand years

79
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:16,867
after that initial expansion of that singularity.

80
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:19,867
So, we're just 300,000 years into

81
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,177
the universe's history, right now.

82
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:28,214
So this is roughly 300,000 years into

83
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:32,267
the universe's... life, I guess we could view it that way.

84
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,315
And let's say at that point - well, first of all

85
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,455
at that point, things haven't differentiated

86
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,034
in meaningful ways yet, right now.

87
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:41,249
We'll talk more about this when we talk about

88
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,678
the cosmic microwave background radiation,

89
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,015
but at this point in the universe

90
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:48,067
it was kind of this almost uniform

91
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:51,109
whitehot plasma of hydrogen.

92
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,966
And we're going to talk about - it was emmiting

93
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:54,777
microwave radiation, and we'll talk more about that

94
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:56,082
in a future video.

95
00:04:56,082 --> 00:05:00,397
But let's just think about two points in this early universe.

96
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:03,467
So, in this early universe, let's say you have that point,

97
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:04,808
and let's say you have

98
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,495
the coordinate where we are right now.

99
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,767
I won't make it the center.

100
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,746
'Cause I think it makes it easier to visualize

101
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:15,938
if it's not the center.

102
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,462
And let's say that very early stage in the universe

103
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:21,310
if you were able to just take some rullers

104
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,800
instantaneously and measure that,

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,180
you would measure this distance

106
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:29,449
to be 30 million light-years.

107
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:37,800
And let's just say right at that point,

108
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,799
this [magenta] object over here

109
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,000
emits a photon. Maybe in the microwave

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,880
frequency range, and we'll see

111
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,462
that that was the range it was emmitting in.

112
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:50,134
But, it emits a photon.

113
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:51,996
And that photon is traveling at the speed of light!

114
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,062
It IS light!

115
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,536
And so, that photon says, "Oh, you know..."

116
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:56,902
"I only got 30 million light-years to travel."

117
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,354
"That's not too bad. I'm gonna get there"

118
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:00,252
"in thirty-million years."

119
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:02,585
And so - and I'm going to do it descrete.

120
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,656
The math is really more complicated than what I'm doing here,

121
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,435
But I really just want to give you the idea

122
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,010
of what's going on, here.

123
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,056
So, let's just say, that photon says,

124
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:13,069
you know, "In about ten million years, I should be"

125
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:17,274
"right about at that coordinate."

126
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,645
"I should be about one third of the distance."

127
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:25,800
But what happens over the course of those ten million years?

128
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,938
Well, over those 10 million years,

129
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,118
the universe has expanded some.

130
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:32,538
The universe has expanded, maybe, a good deal.

131
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,498
So let me draw the expanded universe

132
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:37,967
So after ten million years, the universe...

133
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,654
...might look like this.

134
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:43,071
(Actually, it might even be bigger than that.)

135
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,000
(Let me draw it like this.)

136
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,132
After ten million years,

137
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:49,470
the universe might have expanded a good bit.

138
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,419
So, this is ten million years into the future.

139
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:56,839
Still, on a cosmological time scale,

140
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,104
still almost at the infancy of the universe,

141
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,550
'cause we're talking about 13.7 billion years.

142
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,875
So let's say 10 million years go by.

143
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,363
The universe has expanded.

144
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,062
This coordinate where we're sitting at present

145
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,460
is now all the way over here.

146
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,774
That coordinate where the photon was

147
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:21,425
originally emitted is now

148
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:23,839
going to be sitting right over here.

149
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,604
And that photon has said, "Ok,"

150
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:27,479
"After ten million light-years [sic] I'm going to get"

151
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,887
"over there,"

152
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,454
And, you know, I'm aproximating and I'm doing it

153
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:32,604
in a very descrete way - I really just want to give you the idea.

154
00:07:32,604 --> 00:07:35,600
So that coordinate, roughly where the photon

155
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,210
gets in ten million light years

156
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,915
Is about right over here.

157
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:39,877
The whole universe has expanded.

158
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,704
All the coordinates have gotten further apart.

159
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,129
Now what just happened here?

160
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,462
The universe has expanded.

161
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:47,720
This distance that was 30 million light-years

162
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,853
now - and I'm just making rough numbers -

163
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:56,467
now it is actually - this is really just for the sake of

164
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:01,946
giving you the idea of why... giving you the intuition

165
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:03,773
of what's going on -

166
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,333
This distance now is no longer 30 million light-years

167
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,215
Maybe it's a hundred million.

168
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,476
So this is now a hundred million light-years.

169
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,878
The universe is expanding.

170
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:21,080
The space is actually spreading out.

171
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,952
You can imagine it's kind of a trampoline,

172
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,197
or the surface of a baloon - getting stretched thin.

173
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:28,169
And so this coordinate where the light happens to be

174
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,237
after ten million years,

175
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:31,420
it has been traveling for ten million years,

176
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,867
but it's gone a much larger distance!

177
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:39,000
It has now gone - that distance might be

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,707
on the order of maybe 30 million light years.

179
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,098
And the math isn't exact, here.

180
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:46,652
I haven't done the math to figure it out.

181
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,903
But the point here - so, it's done 30 million light-years.

182
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,503
And actually, I shouldn't even make it

183
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:55,243
the same proportion, because the distance it's gone

184
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,636
and the distance it has to go,

185
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,333
because of the stretching, it's not going to be

186
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,652
completely linear. At least, when I'm thinking about it

187
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,999
in my head, it shouldn't be, I think.

188
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,000
But I'm not going to make a hard statement

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
about that.

190
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,067
But the distance that it traversed - maybe

191
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:13,308
this distance right here is now 20 million light-years

192
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:18,000
...because every time it moved some distance,

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,800
the space that it had traversed is now stretched.

194
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,194
So even though it's travelled for 10 million years,

195
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:30,000
the space that it traversed is no longer just

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,652
10 million light-years.

197
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,933
It's now stretched to 20 million light years.

198
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:36,067
And the space that it has left to traverse

199
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,339
is no longer only 20 million light-years.

200
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,986
It might now be 80 million light-years.

201
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,931
And so, this photon might be getting frustrated.

202
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,021
There's an optimistic way of viewing it, is like,

203
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,179
"Wow! I was able to cover 20 million light-years"

204
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,898
"in only ten million years."

205
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:56,003
"It looks like I'm moving faster than the speed of light."

206
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,867
The reality is, it's not, because the space coordinates themselves

207
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,677
are spreading out.

208
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,231
Those are getting thin. So, the photon is just moving

209
00:10:03,231 --> 00:10:05,925
at the speed of light. But the distance that it actually

210
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:08,267
traversed in ten million years is more than

211
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,847
ten million light-years.

212
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,519
It's 20 million light-years.

213
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,677
So, you can't just multiply rate by time

214
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:17,163
on these cosmological scales, here.

215
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,671
Especially when the coordinates themselves

216
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:23,525
are actually moving away from each other.

217
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:28,333
But I think you might see where this is going.

218
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,863
Now this photon says, "Oh,"

219
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:35,321
"In another 40 million light years [sic],"

220
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:40,012
"maybe I'm going to get over here."

221
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,984
But the reality is over that next 40 million years,

222
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:48,092
it might get right over here,

223
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:50,507
'cause this is 80 million light years.

224
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:54,269
The reality is, after 40 million years,

225
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:55,989
so, another 40 million years go by...

226
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,049
Now, all of a sudden, the universe has expanded

227
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,000
even more!

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,840
I won't even draw the whole bubble,

229
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,285
but the place where the photon was emitted from

230
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,575
might be over here,

231
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:12,292
and now our current position is over here,

232
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:16,678
where the light got after ten million years

233
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,456
is now over here,

234
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:23,431
and now where the light is after 40 million years,

235
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:26,131
is maybe over here.

236
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:31,456
So, now this distance between these two points:

237
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,852
when we started, it was 10 million light years,

238
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,003
then it became 20 million light-years

239
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,944
maybe now it's on the order of - I dont' know

240
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:41,777
maybe it's a billion light years!

241
00:11:41,777 --> 00:11:45,395
And maybe this distance over here,

242
00:11:45,395 --> 00:11:47,348
and I'm just making up these numbers,

243
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:49,716
in fact, that's probably too big for that point...

244
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:52,869
Maybe this is now a hundred million light-years.

245
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,322
And now, this distance maybe is, I dunno

246
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,858
500 million light-years.

247
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:05,925
And maybe now the total distance between the two points is a billion light years.

248
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,729
So, as you can see, the photon might be getting frustrated.

249
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,896
As it covers more and more distance, it looks back,

250
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:15,933
and says, "Wow, in only 50 million years, I've been able to cover 600 million light-years,"

251
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,071
"That's pretty good."

252
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,604
But it's frustrated, because what it thought

253
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,922
it had to cover - 30 million light-years -

254
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,890
that keeps stretching out.

255
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,591
'cause space itself is stretching.

256
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,167
So the reality, just going to the original idea,

257
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:36,251
this photon that is just reaching us

258
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:41,916
that has been traveling for, let's say, 13.4 billion years

259
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:46,839
so, it's reaching us just now, so let me just fast-forward 13.4 billion years

260
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,858
from this point now to get to the present day.

261
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:55,467
So if I draw the whole visible universe right over here

262
00:12:55,467 --> 00:13:00,267
this point right over here is going to be where it was emitted from.

263
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:05,618
We are sitting right... over there. And actually...

264
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,600
Let me make something clear. If I'm drawing the whole observable universe,

265
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,731
the center actually should be where we are, 'cause we can observe an equal distance

266
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:16,733
- if things aren't really strange - we can observe an equal distance in any direction.

267
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,766
So, actually, maybe we should put us at the center.

268
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,748
So, this is the entire observable universe. And the photon was emitted from here

269
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:29,703
13.4 billion years ago. So 300,000 years [sic] after that initial big bang.

270
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,579
And it's just getting to us.

271
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:45,067
It is true that the photon has been traveling for 13.7 billion years [sic].

272
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:52,538
But, what's kind of nutty about it is, this object, since we've been expanding away from eachother

273
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:55,647
this object is now, in our best estimates

274
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:03,031
46 billion light-years away from us.

275
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:10,093
And I want to make it very clear:

276
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:13,217
This object is NOW 46 billion light-years away.

277
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:16,133
So when we just use light to observe it, it looks like

278
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:20,880
just based on light years, hey, this light's been traveling 13.7 billion years to reach us,

279
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,595
that's our only way, kind of, with light, to think about the distance, so maybe it's 13.4

280
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:29,286
<i>chuckle</i> (I keep changing the decimal)

281
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,013
but, [maybe it's] 13.4 billion light-years away.

282
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,231
But the reality is, if you had a ruler today

283
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:35,934
and, you know, light-year rulers

284
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:39,025
this thing, the space has stretched so much

285
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,446
that this is now 46 billion light-years.

286
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:43,824
And just to give you a hint of when we talk about

287
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:45,600
the cosmic microwave background radiation,

288
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,477
what will this point in space look like?

289
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:50,990
This thing that's actually 46 billion light-years away

290
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,225
but the photon only took 13.7 [sic] billion years to reach us.

291
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,710
What will this look like?

292
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,867
Well, when we say, "look like," it's based on

293
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,304
the photons that are reaching us right now.

294
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:05,067
Those photons left 13.4 billion years ago.

295
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,016
So, those photons are the photons being emitted

296
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:11,128
from this primitive structure, from this white-hot

297
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:14,913
haze of hydrogen plasma.

298
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:18,651
So what we're going to see is this white-hot haze

299
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:23,836
- so we're going to see this kind of

300
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,125
white hot plasma.

301
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:32,384
Undifferentiated, not differentiated into proper stable atoms, much less stars and galaxies.

302
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:36,269
But white-hot - we're going to see this white hot plasma.

303
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,133
The reality today is that that point in space that's 46 billion years from now [sic]

304
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:46,800
it's probably differentiated into stable atoms and stars and planets and galaxies.

305
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,134
And frankly, if that person - if there is a civilization there right now, and they're sitting right there

306
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:53,933
and they're observing photons being emitted

307
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,400
from our coordinate, from our point in space right now [sic]

308
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,729
They're not going to see us. They're going to see

309
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:02,305
us 13.4 billion years ago. They're going to see

310
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:06,809
the super primitive state of our region of space

311
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:09,642
when it really was just a white-hot plasma.

312
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:12,475
And we're going to talk more about this in the next video, but think about it.

313
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:15,447
ANY photon that's coming from that period in time,

314
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,769
so, from any direction, that's been traveling for

315
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,973
13.4 billion years, from any direction,

316
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:23,800
is going to come from that primitive state, or,

317
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,986
it would have been emitted when the universe was in

318
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,401
that primitive state, when it was just that white-hot

319
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:32,800
plasma, this undifferentiated mass.

320
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,488
And hopefully, that'll give you a sense of where

321
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:38,919
the cosmic microwave background radiation comes from.
