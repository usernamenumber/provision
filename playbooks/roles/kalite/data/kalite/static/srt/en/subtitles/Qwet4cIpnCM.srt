1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,430
Sorry for starting the
presentation with a cough.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,220
I think I still have a little
bit of a bug going around.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,980
But now I want to continue
with the 45-45-90 triangles.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,190
So in the last presentation we
learned that either side of a

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,830
45-45-90 triangle that isn't
the hypotenuse is equal to the

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,600
square route of 2 over 2
times the hypotenuse.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,850
Let's do a couple
of more problems.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,680
So if I were to tell you that
the hypotenuse of this

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,010
triangle-- once again,
this only works for

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,760
45-45-90 triangles.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,870
And if I just draw one 45
you know the other angle's

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,780
got to be 45 as well.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,960
If I told you that the
hypotenuse here is,

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,690
let me say, 10.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,510
We know this is a hypotenuse
because it's opposite

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,340
the right angle.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,680
And then I would ask you
what this side is, x.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,300
Well we know that x is equal
to the square root of 2 over

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,490
2 times the hypotenuse.

20
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,440
So that's square root
of 2 over 2 times 10.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,700
Or, x is equal to 5
square roots of 2.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:07,990
Right?

23
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,910
10 divided by 2.

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,160
So x is equal to 5
square roots of 2.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,630
And we know that this side
and this side are equal.

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:15,900
Right?

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,490
I guess we know this is an
isosceles triangle because

28
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,280
these two angles are the same.

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,770
So we also that this
side is 5 over 2.

30
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,830
And if you're not
sure, try it out.

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,460
Let's try the
Pythagorean theorem.

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,050
We know from the Pythagorean
theorem that 5 root 2 squared,

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,420
plus 5 root 2 squared is equal
to the hypotenuse squared,

34
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,090
where the hypotenuse is 10.

35
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,130
Is equal to 100.

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,170
Or this is just 25 times 2.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,855
So that's 50.

38
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,590
But this is 100 up here.

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,380
Is equal to 100.

40
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,780
And we know, of course,
that this is true.

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,620
So it worked.

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,290
We proved it using the
Pythagorean theorem, and

43
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,740
that's actually how we
came up with this formula

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,260
in the first place.

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,820
Maybe you want to go back to
one of those presentations

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,590
if you forget how we
came up with this.

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,890
I'm actually now going
to introduce another

48
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,620
type of triangle.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,160
And I'm going to do it the same
way, by just posing a problem

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,490
to you and then using the
Pythagorean theorem

51
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,980
to figure it out.

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,780
This is another type
of triangle called a

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,140
30-60-90 triangle.

54
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,220
And if I don't have time
for this I will do

55
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,120
another presentation.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,965
Let's say I have a
right triangle.

57
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,710
That's not a pretty one,
but we use what we have.

58
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,920
That's a right angle.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,260
And if I were to tell you that
this is a 30 degree angle.

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,940
Well we know that the
angles in a triangle

61
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,730
have to add up to 180.

62
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,570
So if this is 30, this is 90,
and let's say that this is x.

63
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:02,400
x plus 30 plus 90 is equal to
180, because the angles in

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,310
a triangle add up to 180.

65
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,770
We know that x is equal to 60.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,600
Right?

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,870
So this angle is 60.

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,370
And this is why it's called a
30-60-90 triangle-- because

69
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,320
that's the names of the three
angles in the triangle.

70
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,320
And if I were to tell you that
the hypotenuse is-- instead of

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,130
calling it c, like we always
do, let's call it h-- and I

72
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,020
want to figure out the other
sides, how do we do that?

73
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,700
Well we can do that
using pretty much the

74
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,210
Pythagorean theorem.

75
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,410
And here I'm going to
do a little trick.

76
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,780
Let's draw another copy of this
triangle, but flip it over

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,990
draw it the other side.

78
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,950
And this is the same triangle,
it's just facing the

79
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,690
other direction.

80
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:48,910
Right?

81
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,040
If this is 90 degrees
we know that these two

82
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,140
angles are supplementary.

83
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,890
You might want to review the
angles module if you forget

84
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,980
that two angles that share kind
of this common line would

85
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,000
add up to 180 degrees.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
So this is 90, this
will also be 90.

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,390
And you can eyeball it.

88
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,010
It makes sense.

89
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,040
And since we flip it, this
triangle is the exact

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,890
same triangle as this.

91
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,130
It's just flipped
over the other side.

92
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,400
We also know that this
angle is 30 degrees.

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,510
And we also know that this
angle is 60 degrees.

94
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,190
Right?

95
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,450
Well if this angle is 30
degrees and this angle is 30

96
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,490
degrees, we also know that this
larger angle-- goes all the way

97
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,230
from here to here--
is 60 degrees.

98
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,770
Right?

99
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,760
Well if this angle is 60
degrees, this top angle is 60

100
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,920
degrees, and this angle on the
right is 60 degrees, then we

101
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,910
know from the theorem that we
learned when we did 45-45-90

102
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,860
triangles that if these two
angles are the same then the

103
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,030
sides that they don't share
have to be the same as well.

104
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,440
So what are the sides
they don't share?

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,490
Well, it's this side
and this side.

106
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,720
So if this side is h
then this side is h.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,200
Right?

108
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,680
But this angle is
also 60 degrees.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,600
So if we look at this 60
degrees and this 60 degrees, we

110
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,760
know that the sides that they
don't share are also equal.

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,800
Well they share this side, so
the sides that they don't share

112
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,370
are this side and this side.

113
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,460
So this side is h, we also
know that this side is h.

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,270
Right?

115
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,470
So it turns out that if you
have 60 degrees, 60 degrees,

116
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,680
and 60 degrees that all the
sides have the same lengths, or

117
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,810
it's an equilateral triangle.

118
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,670
And that's something
to keep in mind.

119
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,080
And that makes sense too,
because an equilateral triangle

120
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,830
is symmetric no matter
how you look at it.

121
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,030
So it makes sense that all of
the angles would be the same

122
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,370
and all of the sides would
have the same length.

123
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,420
But, hm.

124
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,090
When we originally did this
problem we only used half of

125
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,050
this equilateral triangle.

126
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,970
So we know this whole side
right here is of length h.

127
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,670
But if that whole side is of
length h, well then this side

128
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,530
right here, just the base of
our original triangle-- and I'm

129
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,480
trying to be messy on purpose.

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,490
We tried another color.

131
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,180
This is going to be
half of that side.

132
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,460
Right?

133
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,890
Because that's h over 2,
and this is also h over 2.

134
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,770
Right over here.

135
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,990
So if we go back to our
original triangle, and we said

136
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,730
that this is 30 degrees and
that this is the hypotenuse,

137
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,540
because it's opposite the right
angle, we know that the side

138
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,350
opposite the 30 degree side
is 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

139
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,140
And just a reminder,
how did we do that?

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,840
Well we doubled the triangle.

141
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,570
Turned it into an
equilateral triangle.

142
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,490
Figured out this whole
side has to be the same

143
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,490
as the hypotenuse.

144
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,760
And this is 1/2 of
that whole side.

145
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,420
So it's 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

146
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,090
So let's remember that.

147
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,060
The side opposite the 30 degree
side is 1/2 of the hypotenuse.

148
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,530
Let me redraw that on another
page, because I think

149
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,120
this is getting messy.

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,880
So going back to what
I had originally.

151
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,570
This is a right angle.

152
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,700
This is the hypotenuse--
this side right here.

153
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,080
If this is 30 degrees, we just
derived that the side opposite

154
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,830
the 30 degrees-- it's like what
the angle is opening into--

155
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,180
that this is equal to
1/2 the hypotenuse.

156
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,300
If this is equal to 1/2
the hypotenuse then what

157
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,450
is this side equal to?

158
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,660
Well, here we can use the
Pythagorean theorem again.

159
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,685
We know that this side squared
plus this side squared-- let's

160
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:31,470
call this side A-- is
equal to h squared.

161
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:43,330
So we have 1/2 h squared plus A
squared is equal to h squared.

162
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,370
This is equal to h squared
over 4 plus A squared,

163
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,690
is equal to h squared.

164
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,630
Well, we subtract h
squared from both sides.

165
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:01,270
We get A squared is equal to h
squared minus h squared over 4.

166
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,930
So this equals h squared
times 1 minus 1/4.

167
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:14,150
This is equal to 3/4 h squared.

168
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,110
And once going that's
equal to A squared.

169
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,710
I'm running out of space,
so I'm going to go all

170
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,730
the way over here.

171
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,170
So take the square root of both
sides, and we get A is equal

172
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,920
to-- the square root of 3/4
is the same thing as the

173
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,270
square root of 3 over 2.

174
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,510
And then the square root
of h squared is just h.

175
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,350
And this A-- remember,
this isn't an area.

176
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,990
This is what decides the
length of the side.

177
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,630
I probably shouldn't
have used A.

178
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:53,070
But this is equal to the square
root of 3 over 2, times h.

179
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,670
So there.

180
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,320
We've derived what all the
sides relative to the

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,320
hypotenuse are of a
30-60-90 triangle.

182
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,360
So if this is a 60 degree side.

183
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,750
So if we know the hypotenuse
and we know this is a 30-60-90

184
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,080
triangle, we know the side
opposite the 30 degree side

185
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,500
is 1/2 the hypotenuse.

186
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,010
And we know the side opposite
the 60 degree side is the

187
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,410
square root of 3 over 2,
times the hypotenuse.

188
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,250
In the next module I'll show
you how using this information,

189
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,120
which you may or may not want
to memorize-- it's probably

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,950
good to memorize and practice
with, because it'll make you

191
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,850
very fast on standardized
tests-- how we can use this

192
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,740
information to solve the sides
of a 30-60-90 triangle

193
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,900
very quickly.

194
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,780
See you in the next
presentation.
