1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,500
Let's try to subtract 164 from 301. I encourage you to pause the video and try it on your own first.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,700
So let's go place by place. And we can realize where we have to do some borrowing or regrouping.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,300
So the ones place, we have an issue. 4 is larger than 1.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,100
How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number?

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,700
We also have an issue in the tens place. 6 is larger than 0. How do we subtract 6 from 0?

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,100
So the answer that might be jumping into your head is all we've got to do is some borrowing or some regrouping.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,433
But then you might be facing another problem.

8
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,633
You'd say: "Okay. Well, let's try to borrow from the tens place here."

9
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:39,685
So we have a 1, if we could borrow 10 from the tens place, it could be eleven.

10
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:44,967
But there's nothing here in the tens place! There's nothing to borrow so what do we do?

11
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:49,300
So the way I would tackle it is first borrow for the tens place.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,433
So we have nothing here so let's regroup a hundred from the hundreds place.

13
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:59,033
(So that's equivalent to borrowing a 1 from the hundreds place so that's now a 2.)

14
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:06,567
And now the tens place instead of a zero, we're going to have a 10.

15
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,700
Now let's make sure that this still make sense.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:20,100
This is 2 hundred plus 10 tens. 10 tens is a hundred. Plus one. 2 hundred plus a hundred plus 1 is still 301.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,900
So this still makes sense.

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,367
And the reason why this is valuable is now we have something to regroup from the tens place.

19
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:34,902
If we take 1 of these tens (so now we're left with 9 tens) and we give it to the ones place.

20
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:40,033
So you give 10 plus 1, you're going to be left with 11.

21
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:45,633
And we can verify that we still haven't changed the value of the actual number.

22
00:01:45,633 --> 00:01:51,233
200 plus 90 is 290, plus 11 is still 301.

23
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:58,367
Now what was neat about this is now appear all of these numbers are larger than the corresponding number in the same place.

24
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,769
So we're ready to subtract.

25
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:11,033
11 minus 4 is... (Let's see. 10 minus 3 is 7 so...) 11 minus 4 is 7.

26
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:17,905
9 minus 6 is 3. And 2 minus 1 is 1.

27
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,905
So we are left with 137.
