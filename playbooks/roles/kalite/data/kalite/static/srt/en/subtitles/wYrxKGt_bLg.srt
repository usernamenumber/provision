1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,530
Let's solve a few more systems
of equations using

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,520
elimination, but in these it
won't be kind of a one-step

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,070
elimination.

5
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,350
We're going to have to massage
the equations a little bit in

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,530
order to prepare them
for elimination.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,480
So let's say that we have an
equation, 5x minus 10y is

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,130
equal to 15.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:32,159
And we have another equation,
3x minus 2y is equal to 3.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,350
And I said we want to do
this using elimination.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,440
Once again, we could use
substitution, we could graph

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,430
both of these lines and figure
out where they intersect.

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,930
But we're going to
use elimination.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,740
But the first thing you might
say, hey, Sal, you know, with

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,450
elimination, you were
subtracting the left-hand side

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,160
of one equation from another,
or adding the two, and then

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,580
adding the two right-hand
sides.

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,610
And I could do that, because it
was essentially adding the

19
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,180
same thing to both sides
of the equation.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,010
But here, it's not
obvious that that

21
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,870
would be of any help.

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,970
If we added these two left-hand
sides, you would get

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,750
8x minus 12y.

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,580
That wouldn't eliminate
any variables.

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,930
And on the right-hand
side, you would just

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,030
be left with a number.

27
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,400
And if you subtracted,
that wouldn't

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,420
eliminate any variables.

29
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,710
So how is elimination
going to help here?

30
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,370
And the answer is, we can
multiply both of these

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,070
equations in such a way that
maybe we can get one of these

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,250
terms to cancel out with
one of the others.

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,210
And you could really
pick which term you

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,890
want to cancel out.

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,690
Let's say we want to cancel out
the y terms. So I'll just

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,510
rewrite this 5x minus
10y here.

37
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,860
5x minus 10y is equal to 15.

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,260
Now, is there anything that
I can multiply this green

39
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,420
equation by so that this
negative 2y term becomes a

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,200
term that will cancel out
with the negative 10y?

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,980
So I essentially want to make
this negative 2y into a

42
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,690
positive 10y.

43
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,950
Right?

44
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,660
Because if this is a positive
10y, it'll cancel out when I

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,400
add the left-hand sides
of this equation.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,280
So what can I multiply
this equation by?

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,210
Well, if I multiply it by
negative 5, negative 5 times

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,880
negative 2 right here would
be positive 10.

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,949
So let's do that.

50
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:15,870
Let's multiply this equation
times negative 5.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,820
So you multiply the left-hand
side by negative 5, and

52
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,280
multiply the right-hand
side by negative 5.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,310
And what do you get?

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,110
Remember, we're not
fundamentally

55
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,490
changing the equation.

56
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,700
We're not changing the
information in the equation.

57
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,750
We're doing the same thing
to both sides of it.

58
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,950
So the left-hand side of the
equation becomes negative 5

59
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,310
times 3x is negative 15x.

60
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,010
And then negative 5 times
negative 2y is plus 10y, is

61
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,210
equal to 3 times negative
5 is negative 15.

62
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,820
And now, we're ready to
do our elimination.

63
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,980
If we add this to the left-hand
side of the yellow

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,120
equation, and we add the
negative 15 to the right-hand

65
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,690
side of the yellow equation, we
are adding the same thing

66
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,460
to both sides of the equation.

67
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,230
Because this is equal to that.

68
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,480
So let's do that.

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,260
   

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,430
So 5x minus 15y-- we have this
little negative sign there, we

71
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,020
don't want to lose that--
that's negative 10x.

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,320
The y's cancel out.

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,430
Negative 10y plus
10y, that's 0y.

74
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,480
That was the whole point behind
multiplying this by

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,720
negative 5.

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,230
Is going to be equal to--
15 minus 15 is 0.

77
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,450
So negative 10x is equal to 0.

78
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,250
Divide both sides by negative
10, and you get

79
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,010
x is equal to 0.

80
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,880
And now we can substitute back
into either of these equations

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,920
to figure out what y
must be equal to.

82
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Let's substitute into
the top equation.

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:01,280
So we get 5 times 0, minus
10y, is equal to 15.

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,560
Or negative 10y is
equal to 15.

85
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,240
Let me write that.

86
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,290
Negative 10y is equal to 15.

87
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,660
Divide both sides
by negative 10.

88
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,670
And we are left with
y is equal to

89
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,620
15/10, is negative 3/2.

90
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,100
So if you were to graph it,
the point of intersection

91
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,430
would be the point
0, negative 3/2.

92
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,370
And you can verify that it also
satisfies this equation.

93
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,020
The original equation over
here was 3x minus

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,290
2y is equal to 3.

95
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:48,370
3 times 0, which is 0, minus 2
times negative 3/2 is, this is

96
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,810
0, this is positive 3.

97
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,080
Right?

98
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
These cancel out, these
become positive.

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,130
Plus positive 3 is equal to 3.

100
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,040
So this does indeed satisfy
both equations.

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's do another one of these
where we have to multiply, and

102
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,890
to massage the equations, and
then we can eliminate one of

103
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,000
the variables.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,550
Let's do another one.

105
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:21,330
Let's say we have 5x plus
7y is equal to 15.

106
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:29,150
And we have 7-- let me do
another color-- 7x minus 3y is

107
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,350
equal to 5.

108
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,810
Now once again, if you just
added or subtracted both the

109
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,020
left-hand sides, you're
not going to

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,170
eliminate any variables.

111
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,350
These aren't in any way kind of
have the same coefficient

112
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,180
or the negative of their
coefficient.

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,940
So let's pick a variable
to eliminate.

114
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,740
Let's say we want to eliminate
the x's this time.

115
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,180
And you could literally
pick on one of the

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,930
variables or another.

117
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,480
It doesn't matter.

118
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,415
You can say let's eliminate the
y's first. But I'm going

119
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:56,060
to choose to eliminate the x's
first. And so what I need to

120
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,840
do is massage one or both of
these equations in a way that

121
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,330
these guys have the same
coefficients, or their

122
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,510
coefficients are the negatives
of each other, so that when I

123
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,400
add the left-hand sides, they're
going to eliminate

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
each other.

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,960
Now, there's nothing obvious--
I can multiply this by a

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,630
fraction to make it equal
to negative 5.

127
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,950
Or I can multiply this by a
fraction to make it equal to

128
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,930
negative 7.

129
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,420
But even a more fun thing to do
is I can try to get both of

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,220
them to be their least
common multiple.

131
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,980
I could get both
of these to 35.

132
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,130
And the way I can do it is by
multiplying by each other.

133
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,775
So I can multiply this
top equation by 7.

134
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:38,170
   

135
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,560
And I'm picking 7 so that
this becomes a 35.

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,835
And I can multiply this bottom
equation by negative 5.

137
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:49,740
   

138
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,230
And the reason why I'm doing
that is so this becomes a

139
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,270
negative 35.

140
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,980
Remember, my point is I want
to eliminate the x's.

141
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,670
So if I make this a 35, and if
I make this a negative 35,

142
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,630
then I'm going to be all set.

143
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,480
I can add the left-hand
and the right-hand

144
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,070
sides of the equations.

145
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,996
So this top equation, when you
multiply it by 7, it becomes--

146
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,790
let me scroll up a little bit--
we multiply it by 7, it

147
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:22,960
becomes 35x plus 49y is equal
to-- let's see, this is 70

148
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,950
plus 35 is equal to 105.

149
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,250
Right?

150
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,930
15 and 70, plus 35,
is equal to 105.

151
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,960
That's what the top
equation becomes.

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,000
This bottom equation becomes
negative 5 times 7x, is

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,110
negative 35x, negative 5 times
negative 3y is plus 15y.

154
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,520
The negatives cancel out.

155
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,640
And then 5-- this isn't a
minus 5-- this is times

156
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,060
negative 5.

157
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,640
5 times negative 5 is equal
to negative 25.

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,760
Now, we can start with this top
equation and add the same

159
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,220
thing to both sides, where that
same thing is negative

160
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,130
25, which is also equal
to this expression.

161
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,960
So let's add the left-hand
sides and

162
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,710
the right-hand sides.

163
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,250
Because we're really adding the
same thing to both sides

164
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,200
of the equation.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,430
So the left-hand side,
the x's cancel out.

166
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,050
35x minus 35x.

167
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,020
That was the whole point.

168
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,760
They cancel out, and on the
y's, you get 49y plus 15y,

169
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,360
that is 64y.

170
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,470
64y is equal to 105 minus
25 is equal to 80.

171
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:49,060
Divide both sides by 64, and you
get y is equal to 80/64.

172
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,820
And let's see, if you divide
the numerator and the

173
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,570
denominator by 8-- actually
you could probably do 16.

174
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,780
16 would be better.

175
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,590
But let's do 8 first,
just because we

176
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,860
know our 8 times tables.

177
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,720
So that becomes 10/8, and then
you can divide this by 2, and

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,200
you get 5/4.

179
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,020
If you divided just straight
up by 16, you would've gone

180
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,600
straight to 5/4.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,340
So y is equal to 5/4.

182
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,390
Let's figure out what x is.

183
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,340
So we can substitute either into
one of these equations,

184
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,300
or into one of the original
equations.

185
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,140
Let's substitute into the
second of the original

186
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,250
equations, where we had 7x
minus 3y is equal to 5.

187
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,450
That was the original version of
the second equation that we

188
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,790
later transformed into this.

189
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:42,070
So we get 7x minus 3 times y,
times 5/4, is equal to 5.

190
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:49,180
Or 7x minus 15/4
is equal to 5.

191
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,600
Let's add 15/4-- Oh, sorry,
I didn't do that right.

192
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,780
This would be 7x minus 3 times
4-- Oh, sorry, that was right.

193
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,290
What am I doing?

194
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,520
3 times is 15/4.

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,290
Is equal to 5.

196
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:16,960
Let's add 15/4 to both sides.

197
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,290
And what do we get?

198
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,940
The left-hand side just
becomes a 7x.

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,630
These guys cancel out.

200
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,810
And that's going to be
equal to 5, is the

201
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,000
same thing as 20/4.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,740
20/4 plus 15/4.

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,610
Or we get that-- let me scroll
down a little bit-- 7x is

204
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,820
equal to 35/4.

205
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,750
We can multiply both sides by
1/7, or we could divide both

206
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,240
sides by 7, same thing.

207
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,530
Let's multiply both
sides by 1/7.

208
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,380
The same thing as
dividing by 7.

209
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,520
So these cancel out and you're
left with x is equal to--

210
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,190
Here, if you divide 35
by 7, you get 5.

211
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,340
You divide 7 by 7, you get 1.

212
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,100
So x is equal to 5/4 as well.

213
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,960
So the point of intersection of
this right here is both x

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,170
and y are going to
be equal to 5/4.

215
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,900
So if you looked at it as a
graph, it'd be 5/4 comma 5/4.

216
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,170
And let's verify that this
satisfies the top equation.

217
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:29,480
And if you take 5 times
5/4, plus 7 times

218
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,530
5/4, what do you get?

219
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,330
It should be equal to 15.

220
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:39,580
So this is equal to 25/4,
plus-- what is this?

221
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,560
This is plus 35/4.

222
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,020
Which is equal to 60/4, which
is indeed equal to 15.

223
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,220
So it does definitely satisfy
that top equation.

224
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,750
And you could check out this
bottom equation for yourself,

225
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,630
but it should, because we
actually used this bottom

226
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,750
equation to figure out that
x is equal to 5/4.

227
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,066
