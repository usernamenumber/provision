1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,880
In the last video

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,314
I gave the example of this bank that I keep using

3
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:05,896
And in this example

4
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:09,980
as opposed to giving the gold out to make loans

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,980
and be used for projects that gold gets redeposited

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,347
and then re-lent out

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,214
What we did in this examples is that the bank

8
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:17,530
every time it made a loan,

9
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,998
it just made a loan and that created an asset

10
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,764
and then it had a corresponding liability

11
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:23,748
where the liability was either a checking account

12
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:25,880
that the entrepreneur could use or bank notes

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,014
which are essentially cash

14
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:30,297
that the entrepreneur could use to pay their laborers

15
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,480
or to buy their land or whatever they needed to do.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,730
So an obvious question was,

17
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,797
how much could a bank do it?

18
00:00:36,797 --> 00:00:38,014
When does this stop?

19
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,046
Can a bank just keep increasing the left

20
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:41,896
and right hand sides of the balance sheet?

21
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,465
And to answer this question,

22
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:47,780
we'll introduce the idea of a reserve ratio.

23
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,297
So just, I guess, a bit of a review, just to make sure

24
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:52,180
we're clearly reading this balance sheet.

25
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,796
Let me label things a little bit more

26
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:55,297
because sometimes I assume too much.

27
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:57,231
Remember, these are the assets.

28
00:00:57,231 --> 00:01:00,081
The assets are all of these.

29
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:03,849
Let me make a bold line here.

30
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:08,081
All of these is the assets of this bank,

31
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,364
including its building,

32
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:10,915
so its vault down there.

33
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:12,396
And then the liabilities.

34
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:14,347
I'll do that in this red.

35
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,165
I like this red color,

36
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:20,763
But these are the liabilities

37
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:26,889
over here, in this red color, that I am coloring right now

38
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:29,789
And the equity - whoever owns the bank,

39
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,272
whether it's stockholders or maybe

40
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:32,389
it's owned by an individual.

41
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:34,389
Maybe it's owned by me - is what's left over.

42
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:36,965
I'll do it in a nice neutral color.

43
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:41,016
This is the equity.

44
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,149
So the question is, how much can the bank... [continued later]

45
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:52,348
- let me do this, all of these are liabilities -

46
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:53,032
So the question is,

47
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:57,232
how much can the bank continue to issue out more loans

48
00:01:57,232 --> 00:02:00,132
and increase its assets and its liabilities?

49
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:01,097
Remember, every time it'd issue a loan,

50
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,717
like for right here,

51
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:06,397
it issued a 100 gold piece equivalent loan to D -

52
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:11,731
and instead of giving D 100 gold pieces from, say, right here,

53
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,881
it just created a checking account for D,

54
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:15,931
which later D paid to A

55
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:17,748
and that's why it's labeled A right here.

56
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:19,531
Let me relabel another thing

57
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,564
because the gold is a different color

58
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:21,647
just so you see the gold.

59
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,314
This is the gold part of the assets.

60
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,415
Let me make that very clear,

61
00:02:26,415 --> 00:02:31,482
that all of these right here is gold.

62
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:36,512
Maybe I'll color it a little bit

63
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:42,429
That's all gold and there's 500 gold pieces

64
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:46,679
So let's introduce the concept of a reserve ratio

65
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:53,244
Let's think a little bit about what even a reserve is.

66
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:56,094
A reserve is something that you keep aside

67
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,977
because you might need it one day.

68
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:03,443
And in this situation, all of these liabilities -

69
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:07,359
-	whether they're these bank notes outstanding in this example

70
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,359
or whether they're these checking accounts,

71
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,276
these demand accounts - these are all liabilities that

72
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,477
someone can come back to the bank on any given day

73
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:18,910
and say, hey, I want my gold now, for whatever reason.

74
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,228
Maybe I'm leaving town.

75
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,510
Maybe I don't trust the bank anymore.

76
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,627
For whatever reason,

77
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,294
maybe they just want to make some jewelry.

78
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:28,959
For whatever reason, that person wants their gold back.

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,260
These are demand accounts.

80
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,694
These checking accounts are demand accounts

81
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,544
and these notes are things that

82
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:37,044
can be exchanged for gold at any point in time

83
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,710
And we talked a little bit about this earlier

84
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,627
when we started the whole banking discussion,

85
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:45,859
but you have to leave aside a little bit of gold

86
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,726
just in case someone wants their gold back.

87
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,743
So this amount of the gold that

88
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:56,344
you have to leave aside as a reserve,

89
00:03:56,344 --> 00:04:00,077
relative to the total amount of demands you have on that gold,

90
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:03,810
that's the reserve ratio.

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,994
And in this situation, this world that we've created,

92
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:12,860
The reserve store value is gold.

93
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,793
Later on we're going to get ourselves off of this gold system

94
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:20,210
and then that reserve store of value

95
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,811
is actually going to turn into cash,

96
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:22,926
but for right now and

97
00:04:22,926 --> 00:04:24,978
I think it's easier actually to conceptualize gold.

98
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:26,695
Let's stick with gold.

99
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:32,543
The reserve ratio for this bank is the amount of gold assets

100
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:35,194
you won't see this formal definition anywhere

101
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:39,127
because most people are off the gold standard right now

102
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:45,460
but it's the amount of gold assets divided by total

103
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,360
I don't want to say total liabilities

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,660
because the bank could take out loans

105
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,044
that aren't demand loans.

106
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:54,160
Everything on the liabilities right now is on demand loans,

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,509
which means whoever has that liability can come back

108
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,209
and exchange it for gold at any moment in time,

109
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:01,776
but the bank could've taken just a regular loan

110
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:03,827
And a regular loan might not be on demand.

111
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:06,577
A regular loan might be a loan that

112
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:08,027
the bank doesn't have to pay back for 10 years,

113
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:10,278
in which case there's no reason why the bank

114
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,243
would have to set aside some gold to pay that back.

115
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:16,460
So let's make our definition not total liabilities,

116
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:29,160
but total demand liabilities.

117
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,659
So what would be total demand liabilities?

118
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,394
That would be total bank notes in this case

119
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:41,427
and bank notes are also something we'll later leave

120
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,227
a world where every bank is issuing bank notes,

121
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,977
but I just wanted to give you that kind of historical
context,

122
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,978
how bank notes even started off.

123
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,576
Total bank notes and demand accounts,

124
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:58,510
demand or checking accounts.

125
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,909
So let's see what it is for this bank that we have here.

126
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,194
So our total gold assets are 500

127
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,593
and what's our total demand accounts?

128
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:10,210
100 plus 100 plus 100

129
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,694
-	100, 200, 300, 400 - 600 -

130
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:20,493
and I think this is another 100 here - 700.

131
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:26,311
The total demand liabilities, I just figured out, was 700

132
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:32,543
and the gold assets in this bank are 500.

133
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:34,394
So right now the reserve ratio of this bank

134
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:43,212
is pretty high - 5/7. So I don't know what 5/7 is.

135
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:47,529
If I'm doing my mental math right, it's about 62% -

136
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:54,275
7 goes into 50 - no, no, 7 goes into 50, 7 times

137
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:59,209
- it's like 71%. Right. 7 times 7 is 49-- 71%.

138
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,159
So that's its reserve ratio.

139
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,241
And what keeps banks from just keep issuing more assets

140
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,724
and debts to expand its balance sheet

141
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:09,888
is a reserve ratio requirement.

142
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,323
So right now in the United States –

143
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:12,490
although we're not on the gold standard,

144
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,490
but you could imagine it in this world

145
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,340
our bank regulators might say that your reserve ratio

146
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,505
on demand accounts, so the amount of gold

147
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:24,723
you have to set aside for checking accounts

148
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,023
- so reserve requirement, we'll call it.

149
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,639
Let me change colors just to ease the monotony.

150
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,889
The reserve requirement

151
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,123
They might say the reserve requirement is equal to -

152
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:36,440
let's say they want to be safe.

153
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,473
Let's say they want to make it 20%.

154
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,791
In the U.S. right now, it's 10%,

155
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:44,740
although the reserve commodity isn't gold anymore.

156
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,140
Let's say your reserve requirement is 20%.

157
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,740
That means as long as - at any given moment in time,

158
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,656
more than 20% of these people

159
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,173
don't demand their money back,

160
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:59,306
the bank's going to have liquidity.

161
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:03,340
The bank is going to be able to fulfill its promise.

162
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,305
Because all of these people think at any given moment

163
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:07,140
They can go to the bank and get their gold.

164
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,556
In order for this system to work,

165
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,856
there has to be confidence

166
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,589
and in order for there to be confidence,

167
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,156
the bank has to be good for it

168
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,124
every time someone asks for their money.

169
00:08:16,124 --> 00:08:19,439
So the bank has to stay liquidate

170
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,255
So essentially this reserve ratio is

171
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,889
what the regulators think that a bank needs to maintain,

172
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,874
in order to maintain, be liquid

173
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:30,640
Our bank as it is right now, it has a reserve ratio of 71%.

174
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,124
So as long as no more than 71% of these people

175
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:36,690
some of these loans, they might be out for a year or two.

176
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,206
So as long as -

177
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:39,840
- in that year or two that these loans are out -

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,105
as long as no more than 71% of these people don't come asking for their gold

179
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,540
we should be OK.

180
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,272
If all of a sudden for whatever weird reason, I don't know,

181
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:55,772
80% of these people who have demand deposits or

182
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:58,206
bank notes come and want to switch their money for gold,

183
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:01,105
this bank is going to run out of gold

184
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:02,324
and that's a bank run.

185
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:06,172
And there's a couple of reasons why that's really bad.

186
00:09:06,172 --> 00:09:09,789
One is, all of a sudden these demand deposit accounts

187
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:12,356
all of a sudden don't seem to be that great

188
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:14,588
because you're not really getting your gold on
demand

189
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,506
because more people are asking for gold than there is gold.

190
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,306
And the other problem is, all of a sudden,

191
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:21,090
everyone will lose confidence in the system

192
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,472
and everyone's going to think,

193
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:25,340
oh boy, these banks that have these nice vault-looking buidlings

194
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,673
maybe they're not as safe as I thought.

195
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:30,755
So everyone is going to start pulling their money out.

196
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:32,291
And that's called a bank run.

197
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,289
So in this example, if I assume,

198
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,105
that this loan is really worth 300 gold pieces

199
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,855
and it's really going to be paid back

200
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,555
and this loan right here is really worth 100 gold pieces

201
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,206
and it really will be paid back,

202
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,705
this bank is solvent.

203
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,656
It has more assets than it does liabilities.

204
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,723
So if it has enough time,

205
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:53,156
it will be able to pay back all of its liabilities.

206
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:55,672
But if all of these people, all of a sudden, come in and

207
00:09:55,672 --> 00:10:01,657
want not just 500 gold pieces, if they want 600 gold pieces,

208
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:03,356
right, they're owed actually 700 - so if they want 600 gold pieces

209
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:05,505
all of a sudden

210
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,657
everyone's going to lose confidence in the system

211
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:10,506
These people probably - if they're not able to get that,

212
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:11,589
they're probably going to want all their money back

213
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:14,689
so then all of these liabilities are going to come due.

214
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:17,991
And then maybe the bank is going to have to try to sell its assets

215
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:20,106
these loans to someone else

216
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,173
or maybe try to collect from someone,

217
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:25,112
but as you can imagine, it's a whole... big mess and

218
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,879
the whole system which is dependent on confidence

219
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,142
will just start to crumble.

220
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:32,809
But anyway, the initial question is, what is the limit to how much

221
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:36,041
you can expand the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet

222
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,559
just by creating these loans and these deposit accounts?

223
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,576
And that limit is driven by the reserve ratio,

224
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,109
whatever the regulators set.

225
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:48,900
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
