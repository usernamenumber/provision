1
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:12,727
Let's say Pete over here thinks that he's a pretty good investor,

2
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,067
so what he does is, or he has an idea, and says

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,645
"Well look, I'm gonna create a corporation,

4
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,898
and I'm gonna get a bunch of people to contribute money to that corporation

5
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:23,887
and then I'll manage that money, and maybe I'll take a little fee for myself

6
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,319
so that I can, um, maybe hire some analysts

7
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,178
or get some computers, or get some office space."

8
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,213
So what he does is he sets up a corporation

9
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:35,431
Let's say he sets up a corporation right over here

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,516
And let's say the way he first sets up the corporation

11
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:41,360
let's say it just has 4 shares. And I making the number really small

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,068
just to make the drawing and the map easy.

13
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:48,217
This wouldn't be realistic, normally it would be something in the 100s or 1,000s of shares

14
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:50,963
or maybe even more than that, but let's say it has 4 shares

15
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,055
and let's say all of the 4 shares are owned by Pete initially

16
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:58,242
just to simplify the explanation.

17
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:04,217
And he puts in $400 into this corporation,

18
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:08,310
so another way to think about it, in exchange putting $400 into this corporation

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,303
he gets 4 shares, or each share is worth $100

20
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:17,698
Each of these shares right over here.

21
00:01:17,698 --> 00:01:20,439
And so what he does, is he registers this corporation

22
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,475
I'm talking about a US specific case, but there's similar types of organizations

23
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:29,603
in other countries. He registers this organization right over here

24
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:33,931
with the US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)

25
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:37,955
And he also registers himself with the SEC, or even better

26
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:41,656
he registers a management company that he runs with the SEC

27
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:45,945
so let's call it "Pete, Inc." is a corporation he starts off

28
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:48,874
that he also registers with the SEC.

29
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,072
And when he registers with the SEC he tells them that look,

30
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:54,531
"This company right over here, we're going to issue more shares

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,188
for more people to contribute money, and I'm going to manage this money right over here

32
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,215
and I'm just going to take a percentage of the total

33
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:04,288
assets under management. Sometimes you'll see AUM used

34
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:08,913
that just means Assets Under Management. That will go to Pete, Inc. every year

35
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:12,704
for figuring out the best place to invest this money.

36
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:15,887
And it's usually on the order of about 1%, sometimes a little bit less

37
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,853
sometimes a little bit more, so 1% per year.

38
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:25,858
So right now with only $400 under management, it would only be about $4 per year

39
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,006
but since he registered with the SEC

40
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:31,388
he can call himself a mutual fund and he can

41
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:36,045
solicit funds from the public. So it is a mutual fund

42
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,015
he has met, he has jumped through all the hoops

43
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:40,806
that the SEC sets up for him, so he can market

44
00:02:40,806 --> 00:02:45,282
he can market himself as some type of great fund manager

45
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:46,780
we don't know if that true or not,

46
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,349
and he can also solicit funds from the public

47
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:53,099
So from the public.

48
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,609
And we're gonna see in future videos there are other funds,

49
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,142
especially hedge funds, that can't just, that one

50
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,461
they can't market, and they can't take funds from the public,

51
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,567
those can only take funds from certain types of sophisticated

52
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,248
investors. And what happens in Pete's fund

53
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:08,517
and this isn't going to be an open-ended mutual fund,

54
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,983
that we're showing here, and most mutual funds are like that

55
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,824
let's say that Sal comes along, he likes Pete's marketing materials,

56
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:18,147
and he says, "Hey, I want Pete to manage my money too!"

57
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:22,883
So Sal goes and he gives $100 and says "Pete, give me a share!"

58
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:25,915
So Pete creates another share right over here

59
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,712
he creates another share, he gives it to Sal

60
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:32,681
so he gets 1 share -- that's me, I get 1 share,

61
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,100
an in exchange I give $100 to the fund,

62
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,466
and now the fund has, the fund has $500

63
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,582
So this is another $100 right over here,

64
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:44,962
and now Pete's annual fee is going to be 1% of this whole thing

65
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:48,456
or $5 a year, and if this whole thing grows,

66
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,864
let's say this whole thing doubles from $500,

67
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,951
let's say it doubles to $1,000,

68
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,507
then that $1,000 is essentially split amongst these

69
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:00,623
5 shares now, so all of the people will essentially have

70
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,880
their money doubled, minus whatever Pete's expenses are.

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,189
So let's say that a year goes by,

72
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,839
and then even after paying Pete the 1%

73
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,524
So we had $500 of assets under management,

74
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:14,114
this whole assets under management a year later

75
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:18,247
goes to, let's say it goes to $1,000

76
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:21,064
So Pete is either really good or really lucky

77
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:26,152
or a little bit of both. So it goes to $1,000.

78
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,122
So let me draw it like this.

79
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:32,289
So now it is at $1,000 and it still has the same 5 investors here

80
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,171
and I'm lucky enough to be one of them.

81
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:38,624
So here, the 5 investors. Let me draw the shares,

82
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:45,597
so there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shares.

83
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:49,545
Now each of these shares, well the $1,000 is called the

84
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:52,992
NAV, the Net Asset Value, so let me give you that

85
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,802
piece of terminology, it just means

86
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:57,863
Net Asset Value, and so there's an NAV

87
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:02,064
per share, the NAV per share over here his $200

88
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:05,424
I just took the total NAV and I just divided it by the shares,

89
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:09,070
and what's special about an open-ended mutual fund

90
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,515
is that the close, or at the end of every day

91
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:15,017
either new shares can be removed from the fund

92
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,997
or can be created for the fund. So in the first video

93
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:20,328
I showed how I wanted to buy into the fund,

94
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:22,957
so I bought a share, and that increased the NAV

95
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,961
and also increased the number of shares,

96
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,849
he had to create a share for me to buy,

97
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,196
he didn't sell me a share that already existed.

98
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,460
So you can imagine after this type of performance

99
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,448
more people would want to buy shares,

100
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:36,406
so now they would have to buy in to make things fair

101
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:40,815
at $200 per share, because that's the current NAV per share

102
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:43,598
so let's say that 5 more people want to buy in

103
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:47,351
at $200 per share. So what Pete would do, or what

104
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:50,465
this mutual fund, it's not Pete really, it's the corporation

105
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:58,566
it would create 5 new shares, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

106
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,170
if there was only 1 person that day, it would create 1 share

107
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,248
that day, if there were 10 people that day,

108
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:04,712
it would create 10 shares that day

109
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,397
and it could keep doing this, and the NAV of each of these

110
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:11,335
are $200, so it gives these shares to each of these people

111
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:13,375
and they have to contribute $200, so essentially

112
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:18,689
it puts another $1,000 into the pool that Pete

113
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,647
can now manage, and so now he's met the total

114
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:25,382
NAV for the fund is $2,000 now, and Pete

115
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:29,191
will get his 1% management fee off of this entire

116
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:34,596
$2,000. Now let's say we fast forward a little bit,

117
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,063
we fast forward a little bit to-

118
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,485
let's say Pete start having a not-so-good year.

119
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,943
So let's say we fast forward a year past that,

120
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,552
and Pete's has a minus, a negative 10% return.

121
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:49,261
So if we started at $2,000, and that's when you include

122
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:52,951
taking his management fee out. You start at $2,000

123
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:57,931
you lose 10% in 1 year, so it goes down to $1,800

124
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,267
Let me put this in a new color.

125
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:04,949
So now he's at $1,800. That's not completely drawn to scale,

126
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,569
but hopefully you get the idea.

127
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:13,568
So now he's at $1,800.

128
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:18,468
But you still have a total of 10 shares,

129
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:22,076
So let me try to do my best to draw the 10 shares,

130
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:30,162
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

131
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:31,976
These should be of equal size.

132
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:35,923
And now the NAV per share, the NAV per share

133
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:40,480
is going to be $1,800 divided by 10, or $180

134
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,197
And let's say that I get a little bit freaked out

135
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,448
by this recent performance, and I have some

136
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,216
other commitments with my money,

137
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:50,169
so I say, "Pete, you need to buy my share back for me."

138
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,726
So what Pete does, is he would give me back $180,

139
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:58,881
so the total NAV would lose $180, so it would go down $180

140
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,584
So we would take this out of it,

141
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:09,252
$1,800 minus $180 is $1,620. So now it is $1,620.

142
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:12,540
And they would buy back a share from me,

143
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,699
so they would cancel 1 of the shares,

144
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,775
but notice, the NAV per share does not change,

145
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:18,473
by me redeeming my share, it does not change

146
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:20,223
what happens to everyone else.

147
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,932
Now you have $1,620 divided by 9 shares,

148
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:29,184
that should still get you to be $180 per share.

149
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,518
If I did my math right.

150
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:33,400
So $1,800 minus $180 gets you $1,620,

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,019
it should still be $180 per share,

152
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:38,593
but this is the nature of an open-ended fund,

153
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,749
you could keep creating shares and selling them to the public to raise more money

154
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:45,140
or when someone wants their money back

155
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,341
you essentially buy the share back from them

156
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,700
give them their money when you buy the share back

157
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,382
and you remove that share.

158
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:53,486
So an open-ended fund, really at the close of every

159
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:55,699
trading day can keep growing or shrinking.

160
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,811
It can keep adding more and more investors,

161
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,102
or their investors can take their money back.

162
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:03,566
What's difficult about this from the fund manager's point of view

163
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,445
is that they have to manage this,

164
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,561
they have to manage this constant buying and selling

165
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,351
with the public, they have to manage the paperwork,

166
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,553
and if you think about it, they can't have all of their money invested

167
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,334
in relatively illiquid assets,

168
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,685
or even in regular stocks,

169
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:19,899
they have to keep some amount of their money

170
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,769
and it's usually like 3-5%, they have to keep some of this

171
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,144
$2,000 (before he lost my money)

172
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,290
they have to keep some of it in cash.

173
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,049
And from an investor's point of view,

174
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:32,074
they would say, "Well, if I'm good at investing,

175
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:33,430
I should try to minimize the amount of cash that I have,

176
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,892
because I'm not getting a return on cash,

177
00:09:34,892 --> 00:09:36,352
but because it's open-ended, because investors

178
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:39,134
might come by and say, "Hey, I want my money"

179
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:43,245
you have to have a little bit of cash as part of the asset pool

180
00:09:43,245 --> 99:59:59,999
in order to be able to buy people's shares back.
