1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,380
Let's see if we can get a little
bit more practice and

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,890
intuition of what cross products
are all about.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,450
So in the last example,
we took a cross b.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,580
Let's see what happens when
we take b cross a.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,250
So let me erase some of this.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,230
I don't want to erase all of it
because it might be useful

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,590
to give us some intuition
to compare.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,672
   

10
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:27,170
I'm going to keep that.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,430
   

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,285
Actually, I can erase
this, I think.

13
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:39,600
   

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,100
So the things I have drawn
here, this was a cross b.

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,530
Let me cordon it off so you
don't get confused.

16
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,970
So that was me using the right
hand rule when I tried to do a

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,140
cross b, and then we saw that
the magnitude of this was 25,

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,320
and n, the direction,
pointed downwards.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,330
Or when I drew it here, it would
point into the page.

20
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,650
So let's see what happens with
b cross a, so I'm just

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,000
switching the order.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,760
b cross a.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,090
Well, the magnitude is going to
be the same thing, right?

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,610
Because I'm still going to take
the magnitude of b times

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,720
the magnitude of a times the
sine of the angle between

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,100
them, which was pi over 6
radians and then times some

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,585
unit vector n.

28
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:37,930
But this is going
to be the same.

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,830
When I multiply scalar
quantities, it doesn't matter

30
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,510
what order I multiply
them in, right?

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,030
So this is still going to be
25, whatever my units might

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,900
have been, times
some vector n.

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,920
And we still know that that
vector n has to be

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,020
perpendicular to both a and b,
and now we have to figure out,

35
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,080
well, is it, in being
perpendicular, it can either

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,050
kind of point into the page here
or it could pop out of

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,450
the page, or point
out of the page.

38
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,570
So which one is it?

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,290
And then we take our right hand
out, and we try it again.

40
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,560
So what we do is we take
our right hand.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,990
I'm actually using my right hand
right now, although you

42
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,920
can't see it, just to make sure
I draw the right thing.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,800
So in this example, if I take
my right hand, I take the

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,400
index finger in the
direction of b.

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,140
I take my middle finger in the
direction of a, so my middle

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,230
figure is going to look
something like that, right?

47
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,310
And then I have two leftover
fingers there.

48
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,610
Then the thumb goes in the
direction of the cross

49
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,060
product, right?

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,025
Because your thumb has a right
angle right there.

51
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,920
That's the right angle
of your thumb.

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,770
So in this example, that's the
direction of a, this is the

53
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,480
direction of b, and we're
doing b cross a.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,020
That's why b gets your
index finger.

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,410
The index finger gets the first
term, your middle finger

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,010
gets the second term, and the
thumb gets the direction of

57
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,330
the cross product.

58
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,280
So in this example, the
direction of the cross product

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,820
is upwards.

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,840
Or when we're drawing it in two
dimensions right here, the

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,440
cross product would actually
pop out of the

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,340
page for b cross a.

63
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,250
So I'll draw it over.

64
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,080
It would be the circle
with the dot.

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,790
Or if I were to draw it
analogous to this, so this

66
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,650
right here, that
was a cross b.

67
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,150
And then b cross a is the exact
same magnitude, but it

68
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,420
goes in the other direction.

69
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,486
That's b cross a.

70
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:44,020
It just flips in the
opposite direction.

71
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,340
And that's why you have to use
your right hand, because you

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,240
might know that, oh, something's
going to pop in or

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,960
out of the page, et cetera, et
cetera, but you need to know

74
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,110
your right hand to know
whether it goes in

75
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,350
or out of the page.

76
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,380
Anyway, let's see if we can
get a little bit more

77
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,900
intuition of what this is all
about because this is all

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,540
about intuition.

79
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,320
And frankly, I'll tell you, the
cross product comes into

80
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,430
use in a lot of concepts that
frankly we don't have a lot of

81
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,590
real-life intuition, with
electrons flying through a

82
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,780
magnetic field or magnetic
fields through a coil.

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,880
A lot of things in our everyday
life experience,

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,430
maybe if we were metal filings
living in a magnetic field--

85
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,570
well, we do live in
a magnetic field.

86
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,380
In a strong magnetic field,
maybe we would get an

87
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,600
intuition, but it's hard to have
as deep of an intuition

88
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,780
as we do for, say, falling
objects, or friction, or

89
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,310
forces, or fluid dynamics even,
because we've all played

90
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,440
with water.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,810
But anyway, let's get a little
bit more intuition.

92
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,800
And let's think about why is
there that sine of theta?

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,180
Why not just multiply the
magnitudes times each other

94
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,520
and use the right hand rule and
figure out a direction?

95
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,170
What is that sine of
theta all about?

96
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:57,840
I think I need to clear this up
a little bit just so this

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
could be useful.

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,390
So why is that sine
of theta there?

99
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,480
   

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,780
Let me redraw some vectors.

101
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,200
I'll draw them a
little fatter.

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:22,870
So let's say that's a,
that's a, this is b.

103
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,500
b doesn't always have
to be longer than a.

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,630
So this is a and this is b.

105
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,850
Now, we can think of
it a little bit.

106
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,550
We could say, well, this is the
same thing as a sine theta

107
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,650
times b, or we could say this
is b sine theta times a.

108
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,200
I hope I'm not confusing-- all
I'm saying is you could

109
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,020
interpret this as--
because these are

110
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,090
just magnitudes, right?

111
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,950
So it doesn't matter what order
you multiply them in.

112
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,790
You could say this is a sine
theta times the magnitude of

113
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,600
b, all of that in the direction
of the normal

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,630
vector, or you could put the
sine theta the other way.

115
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,890
But let's think about what
this would mean.

116
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,050
a sine theta, if
this is theta.

117
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,410
What is a sine theta?

118
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,210
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse, right?

119
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,450
So opposite over hypotenuse.

120
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:17,470
So this would be the
magnitude of a.

121
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,935
Let me draw something.

122
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:24,160
Let me draw a line here and
make it a real line.

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
Let me draw a line there,
so I have a right angle.

124
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,030
   

125
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,370
So what's a sine theta?

126
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,760
This is the opposite side.

127
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,110
So a sine theta is a, and sine
of theta is opposite over

128
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,150
hypotenuse.

129
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,230
The hypotenuse is the magnitude
of a, right?

130
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,880
So sine of theta is equal to
this side, which I call o for

131
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,720
opposite, over the
magnitude of a.

132
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,850
So it's opposite over
the magnitude of a.

133
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,440
So this term a sine theta is
actually just the magnitude of

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,170
this line right here.

135
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,220
Another way you could--
let me redraw it.

136
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,940
It doesn't matter where the
vectors start from.

137
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,540
All you care about is this
magnitude and direction, so

138
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,970
you could shift vectors
around.

139
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,830
So this vector right here, and
you could call it this

140
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,880
opposite vector, that's the
same thing as this vector.

141
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,610
That's the same thing as this.

142
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,035
I just shifted it away.

143
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:26,160
   

144
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,470
And so another way to think
about it is, it is the

145
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,820
component of vector a, right?

146
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,260
We're used to taking a vector
and splitting it up into x-

147
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,360
and y-components, but now we're
taking a vector a, and

148
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,140
we're splitting it up into--
you can think of it as a

149
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,350
component that's parallel to
vector b and a component that

150
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,430
is perpendicular to vector b.

151
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:54,460
So a sine theta is the magnitude
of the component of

152
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,250
vector a that is perpendicular
to b.

153
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,060
So when you're taking the cross
product of two numbers,

154
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,500
you're saying, well, I don't
care about the entire

155
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,100
magnitude of vector a in this
example, I care about the

156
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,330
magnitude of vector a that is
perpendicular to vector b, and

157
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,860
those are the two numbers that
I want to multiply and then

158
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,120
give it that direction
as specified by

159
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,090
the right hand rule.

160
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,340
And I'll show you some
applications.

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,390
This is especially important--
well, we'll use it in torque

162
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,290
and we'll also use it in
magnetic fields, but it's

163
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,500
important in both of those
applications to figure out the

164
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,610
components of the vector that
are perpendicular to either a

165
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,600
force or a radius in question.

166
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,659
So that's why this cross product
has the sine theta

167
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,070
because we're taking-- so in
this, if you view it as

168
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,210
magnitude of a sine theta
times b, this is kind of

169
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,030
saying this is the magnitude
of the component of a

170
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,435
perpendicular to b, or
you could interpret

171
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:51,060
it the other way.

172
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:59,120
You could interpret it as a
times b sine theta, right?

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,400
Put a parentheses here.

174
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,500
And then you could view
it the other way.

175
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,610
You could say, well, b sine
theta is the component of b

176
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,710
that is perpendicular to a.

177
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,110
Let me draw that, just to
hit the point home.

178
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,800
So that's my a, that's my b.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,260
   

180
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,950
This is a, this is b.

181
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,510
So b has some component of it
that is perpendicular to a,

182
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,190
and that is going to look
something like-- well, I've

183
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,480
run out of space.

184
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,640
Let me draw it here.

185
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,210
If that's a, that's b, the
component of b that is

186
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,760
perpendicular to a is going
to look like this.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,300
   

188
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,370
It's going to be perpendicular
to a, and it's going to go

189
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,580
that far, right?

190
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,230
And then you could go back to
SOH CAH TOA and you could

191
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,850
prove to yourself that the
magnitude of this vector is b

192
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,650
sine theta.

193
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,410
So that is where the sine
theta comes from.

194
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,990
It makes sure that we're not
just multiplying the vectors.

195
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,320
It makes sure we're multiplying
the components of

196
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,540
the vectors that are
perpendicular to each other to

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,650
get a third vector that is
perpendicular to both of them.

198
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,310
And then the people who invented
the cross product

199
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,010
said, well, it's still ambiguous
because it doesn't

200
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,475
tell us-- there's always two
vectors that are perpendicular

201
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:22,300
to these two.

202
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,050
One goes in, one goes out.

203
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,340
They're in opposite
directions.

204
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,950
And that's where the right
hand rule comes in.

205
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,080
They'll say, OK, well, we're
just going to say a convention

206
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,195
that you use your right hand,
point it like a gun, make all

207
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:34,410
your fingers perpendicular,
and then you know what

208
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,760
direction that vector
points in.

209
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,830
Anyway, hopefully, you're
not confused.

210
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,670
Now I want you to watch
the next video.

211
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,890
This is actually going to be
some physics on electricity,

212
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,400
magnetism and torque, and
that's essentially the

213
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,250
applications of the cross
product, and it'll give you a

214
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,770
little bit more intuition
of how to use it.

215
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,470
See you soon.

216
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,400
