1
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:09,499
Ancient Greek's sculptures, bronze or marble, are frozen

2
00:00:09,499 --> 00:00:13,399
but that doesn't mean that the the Ancient Greeks did not want to convey

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,123
movement. In this

4
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:18,742
case movement that couldn't even see with the naked eye

5
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:22,482
What we are looking at is a sculpture by a artist whose name is Myron.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:27,748
We've lost his original, but we have a later marble

7
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:29,813
of the discuss thrower.

8
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:34,394
The original was in bronze from the 5th century BCE.

9
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:38,678
About 450 to 460 and what we are looking at is one of many

10
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:42,648
Roman copies, in fact, there is one next to the other in this museum

11
00:00:42,648 --> 00:00:45,661
Testimate to how popular these were among the Romans.

12
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,979
This sculpture shows a man who is at that moment

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,559
where his body is fully wound.

14
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:54,113
Look at the way that his right leg is

15
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:57,816
baring the weight of his body. His left leg, the toes

16
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:03,799
are bent under, dragging slightly, he is about to throw that discus.

17
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,333
There is this moment of tremendous attention

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,442
but it is also this moment of stasis, stillness, right

19
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,524
before action. Athletes and our historians have

20
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:16,159
debated whether this is even an actual pose that

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,128
the discus thrower would actually takes in the process.

22
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:22,425
It's so interesting because when we look back to the history

23
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:28,013
of the Greek figure we think, first, of the archaic

24
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:30,059
who is so stiff and so stylized and then we just break

25
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:33,151
throughs of people like Polyclitus who develop an understanding

26
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:36,494
of the body and show it in (...) but here we

27
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:40,782
have something so dynamic and so complex and just look at

28
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:44,946
the arc of the shoulders and the arms and the way that they reverse

29
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:47,398
the arc of the twist of the hips.

30
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:53,275
That is the overriding concern of Myron the sculpture to capture

31
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,808
the aesthetic qualities here, the sense of balance

32
00:01:56,808 --> 00:02:00,550
and harmony, and the beauty and the proportions of the body

33
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,931
There is a kind of anti realism here for all of its

34
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:08,982
careful naturalism. There is no real strain

35
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,695
within the body. It is absolutely at rest and ideal

36
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:15,448
even in this extreme pose. If your think of a figure

37
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:20,362
from much later, but in a similar pose of movement and athletic

38
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:25,349
energy like Bernini's David. Well that has got

39
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,581
portion, absolutely. That figure expresses all of the

40
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:31,877
physical power of the face. He is clinching his teeth

41
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:35,798
That's true and his brow is really nit forward, but

42
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:39,311
here the face is absolutely serene and it reminds me

43
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,695
of the consistence that the Greeks always contained

44
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:47,660
their nobility, even in battle, even in terrible situation with monsters

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,533
and here even at this moment when he is about to release

46
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,142
the discus. That nobility, calmness in the face

47
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:58,015
is a sign of a nobility of the human being.

48
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:02,400
Well, this is a sport, and the the man is naked, which

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,609
was what the Greeks did, but there was a real logic there.

50
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,548
Why would you cover up the beauty of the body

51
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,244
in sport, which is a celebration of what the

52
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:13,319
human body can achieve. This is really

53
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,175
a way to remind ourselves of the potential of humanity

54
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:23,426
the potential of the mind and the potential of the body.

55
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,632
Taken that extra step to become even more ideal, more heroic,

56
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:32,584
more noble than even the finest athlete.

57
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:35,865
It is a perfect form.

58
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:39,865
Music...
