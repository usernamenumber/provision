1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,700
Let's do a couple of problems
where the roots of the

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,980
characteristic equation
are complex.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,380
And just as a little bit of a
review, and we'll put this up

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,460
here in the corner so that
it's useful for us.

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,600
We learned that if the roots of
our characteristic equation

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,290
are r is equal to lambda plus
or minus mu i, that the

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:26,360
general solution for our
differential equation is y is

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:34,740
equal to e to the lambda x times
c1 with some constant

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:45,120
cosine of mu x, plus c2
times sine of mu x.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,310
And with that said, let's
do some problems.

12
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,860
So let's see, this first one
that our differential

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,040
equation-- I'll do this one
in blue-- our differential

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,320
equation is the second
derivative, y prime prime plus

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,700
4y prime plus 5y
is equal to 0.

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,200
And they actually give us
some initial conditions.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,610
They say y of 0 is equal
to 1, and y prime of

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,980
0 is equal to 0.

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,660
So now we'll actually be able
to figure out a particular

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,000
solution, or the particular
solution, for this

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,260
differential equation.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,580
So let's write down the
characteristic equation.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:41,700
So it's r squared plus 4r
plus 5 is equal to 0.

24
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,890
Let's break out our
quadratic formula.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,600
The roots of this are going
to be negative b.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,290
So minus 4 plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

27
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,210
So that's 16.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:05,240
Minus 4 times a-- well that's
1-- times 1, times c times 5.

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,940
All of that over 2 times a.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,880
a is 1 so all of that over 2.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,240
And see this simplifies.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,830
This equals minus 4 plus or
minus 16-- this is 20, right?

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,310
4 times 1 times 5 is 20.

34
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,990
So 16 minus 20 is minus 4.

35
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,590
Minus 4 over 2.

36
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:38,670
And that equals minus 4 plus
or minus 2i, right?

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,580
Square root of minus 4 is 2i.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,820
All that over 2.

39
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,900
And so our roots to the
characteristic equation are

40
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,100
minus 2-- just dividing both by
2-- minus 2 plus or minus,

41
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,610
we could say i or 1i, right?

42
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,910
So if we wanted to do some
pattern match, if we just

43
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,050
wanted to do it really fast,
what's our lambda?

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,120
Our lambda is just minus 1.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Let me write that down.

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,800
That's our lambda.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,110
What's our mu?

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,800
Well mu is the coefficient
on the i, so mu is 1.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,260
mu is equal to 1.

50
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,360
And now we're ready to write
down our general solution.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,270
So the general solution to this
differential equation is

52
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,570
y is equal to e to the lambda
x-- well lambda is minus 2--

53
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:36,780
minus 2x times c1 cosine of mu
x-- but mu is just 1-- so c1

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,370
cosine of x, plus c2 sine
of mu x, when mu is

55
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,970
1, so sine of x.

56
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,070
Fair enough.

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,890
Now let's use our initial
conditions to find the

58
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,990
particular solution, or
a particular solution.

59
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,780
So, when x is 0, y
is equal to 1.

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,440
So y is equal to
1 when x is 0.

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,630
So 1 is equal to-- let's
substitute x is 0 here.

62
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,140
So e to the minus 2 times
0, that's just 1.

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,460
So this whole thing becomes 1,
so we could just ignore it.

64
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,490
It's just 1 times this thing.

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,740
So I'll write that down.

66
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:18,970
e to the 0 is 1 times c1 times
cosine of 0, plus c2

67
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,300
times sine of 0.

68
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,530
Now what's sine of 0?

69
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,290
Sine of 0 is 0.

70
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,400
So this whole term
is going to be 0.

71
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,480
Cosine of 0 is 1.

72
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,080
So there, we already
solved for c1.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,570
We get this, this is 1.

74
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,440
So 1 times c1 times
1 is equal to 1.

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,340
So we get our first
coefficient.

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,880
c1 is equal to 1.

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,020
Now let's take the derivative
of our general solution.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,180
And we could even substitute
c1 in here, just so that we

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,740
have to stop writing
c1 all the time.

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,630
And we can solve for c2.

81
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,260
So right now we know that our
general solution is y-- we

82
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,960
could call this our
pseudo-general solution,

83
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,070
because we already solved for
c1-- y is equal to e to the

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,630
minus 2x times c1, but we know
that c1 is 1, so I'll write

85
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:20,130
times cosine of x, plus
c2 times sine of x.

86
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,180
Now let's take the derivative
of this, so that we can use

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,520
the second initial condition.

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,840
So y prime is equal to-- we're
going to have to do a little

89
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,970
bit of product rule here.

90
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,450
So what's the derivative of
the first expression?

91
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,345
It is minus 2e to
the minus 2x.

92
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:39,860
And we multiply that times
the second expression.

93
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,860
Cosine of x plus c2 sine of x.

94
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,390
And then we add that to just the
regular first expression.

95
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,190
So plus e to the minus 2x times
the derivative of the

96
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,840
second expression.

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,750
So what's the derivative
of cosine of x?

98
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,440
It's minus sine of x.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,360
   

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,840
And then what's the derivative
of c2 sine of x?

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,750
Well , it's plus
c2 cosine of x.

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,290
   

103
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:17,080
And let's see if we can do any
kind of simplification here.

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,730
Well actually, the easiest
way, instead of trying to

105
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,310
simplify it algebraically and
everything, let's just use our

106
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,530
initial condition.

107
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,640
Our initial condition is y
prime of 0 is equal to 0.

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,940
Let me write that down.

109
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,170
Second initial condition was
y prime of 0 is equal to 0.

110
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,800
So y prime, when x is equal
to 0, is equal to 0.

111
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,210
And let's substitute x is equal
to 0 into this thing.

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,110
We could have simplified this
more, but let's not worry

113
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,500
about that right now.

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,510
So if x is 0, this is going
to be 1, right?

115
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,370
E to the 0.

116
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,250
e to the 0 is 1, so we're left
with just minus 2, right?

117
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,490
Minus 2 times e to the 0, times
cosine of 0, that's 1,

118
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,060
plus c2 times sine of 0.

119
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,550
Sine of 0 is 0.

120
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,010
So that's just 1 plus 0, plus
e to the minus 2 times 0.

121
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,880
That's just 1.

122
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,870
Times minus sine of 0.

123
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,250
Sine of 0 is just 0.

124
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,530
Plus c2 times cosine of 0.

125
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,870
Cosine of 0 is 1.

126
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,520
So plus c2.

127
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,070
That simplified things,
didn't it?

128
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,730
So let's see, we get 0 is equal
to-- this is just 1--

129
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,130
minus 2 plus c2.

130
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,490
Or we get c2 is equal to 2.

131
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,090
Add 2 to both sides.
c2 is equal to 2.

132
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,950
And then we have our particular
solution.

133
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,230
I know it's c2 is equal to
2, c1 is equal to 1.

134
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,160
Actually, let me erase some of
this, just so that we can go

135
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,245
from our general solution to
our particular solution.

136
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:56,170
   

137
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,600
So we had figured out, you can
remember, c1 is 1 and c2 is 2.

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,570
That's easy to memorize.

139
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,230
So I'll just delete
all of this.

140
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,490
I'll write it nice and big.

141
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,070
So our particular solution,
given these initial

142
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:20,980
conditions, were, or are, or is
y of x is equal to-- this

143
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,220
was a general solution-- e to
the minus 2x times-- we solved

144
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,930
for c1, it's equal to 1.

145
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,890
So we can just write
cosine of x.

146
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,950
And then we solved for c2.

147
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,090
We figured out that
that was 2.

148
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,860
Plus 2 sine of x.

149
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,909
And there you go.

150
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,710
We have our particular solution
to this-- sorry where

151
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,200
did I write it-- to this
differential equation with

152
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,290
these initial conditions.

153
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,870
And what's neat is, when we
originally kind of proved this

154
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,070
formula-- when we originally
showed this formula-- we had

155
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,110
all of these i's and
we simplified.

156
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,210
We said c2, it was a combination
of some other

157
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,640
constants times some i's.

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,380
And we said, oh we don't know
whether they're imaginary or

159
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,075
not, so let's just merge them
into some constant.

160
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,890
But what's interesting is this
particular solution has no i's

161
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,570
anywhere in it.

162
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,530
And so, that tells us a
couple of neat things.

163
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,470
One that, if we had kept this
c2 in terms of some multiple

164
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,745
of i's, and our constants
actually would have had i's

165
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:22,440
and they would have canceled
out, et cetera.

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,860
And it also tells us that this
formula is useful beyond

167
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,230
formulas that just involve
imaginary numbers.

168
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,460
For example, this differential
equation, I don't see an i

169
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,070
anywhere here.

170
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,790
I don't see an i
anywhere here.

171
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,320
And I don't see an
i anywhere here.

172
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,190
But given this differential
equation, to get to the

173
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,770
solution, we had to use
imaginary numbers in between.

174
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,990
And I think this is the first
time-- if I'm remembering all

175
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,800
my playlists correctly-- this is
the first time that we used

176
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
imaginary numbers for
something useful.

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,760
We used it as an intermediary
tool where we got a real, a

178
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,070
non-imaginary solution,
to a real problem, a

179
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,140
non-imaginary problem.

180
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,100
But we used imaginary numbers
as a tool to solve it.

181
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,370
So, hopefully, you found that
slightly interesting.

182
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,960
And I'll see you in
the next video.

183
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,400
