1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,932
In this video I'm gonna use words like

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:09,903
eras, periods, and ages to refer to segments of time

3
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:13,039
in the human or in the pre-human past

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,817
What I wann clarify, right from the get-go

5
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,817
cause thats something that's confused me in the past

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,898
archaeologists will refer to eras periods and ages

7
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:22,899
in the human past, and they usually refer to

8
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:26,039
periods of tens of thousands of years or thousands of years

9
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,235
but these are differents eras periods and ages

10
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:32,147
than the ones that geologists would refer to

11
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,232
when they are talking about geological time.

12
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:38,487
In geological time ERA means several hundred millions of years

13
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:40,899
periods and ages mean millions of years

14
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,149
when an archaeologists, when we are studying the human past

15
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:49,069
they are just generally talking about the long segments of human time

16
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:54,153
but not in the millions of years, usually in the thousands or ten thousands of years.

17
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,817
So what I wanna do, with that out of the way

18
00:00:56,817 --> 00:01:00,514
is talk about what has happened in the distant human past

19
00:01:00,514 --> 00:01:03,068
or the distant pre-human past, and also

20
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:06,774
touch on some of the classifications for these segments of time,

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,003
because they actually tell us about the interesting developments

22
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:16,172
that happened to humanity over the 200,000 years

23
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:19,651
that Homo sapiens have been on this planet

24
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,065
or that we believe that Homo sapiens have been on this planet

25
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:27,982
So the longest period of time in the human past

26
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:31,573
or the category of human time, and there are different ways we can categorize,

27
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:39,166
is the Paleolithic era right over here.

28
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:42,896
And what really makes that period of time -

29
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:47,149
so this begins even at pre-history or pre-human history

30
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,815
before Homo sapiens even existed

31
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:52,314
you have the beginning of the Paleolithic era

32
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:55,400
that really began with the development of stone tools

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,574
And as we learned in the video on Human Evolution

34
00:01:57,574 --> 00:02:02,108
there were pre-Homo sapiens species that were using stone tools.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,656
So the Paleolithic Era is really kind of signified by 1 of the stone tools,

36
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:11,775
but even more that either the pre-humans

37
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,984
or once you go about 200,000 years ago

38
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,907
the humans showd-up is kinda distinguished by

39
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:20,237
humans being hunter-gatherers.

40
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:21,568
Which essentially mean, to survive

41
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,708
we used to walk around a lot, you know,

42
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:28,306
if we couldn't see something obvious to hunt,

43
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:30,905
maybe a wooly mammoth or something

44
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,819
If we didn't see something obvious to hunt

45
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,676
we would look around for snails or mushrooms or whatever else,

46
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,403
and that how we would survive, that's how we would live.

47
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:43,825
And because we were constantly adapting to our environment based on the seasons,

48
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,366
we would be maybe following animals as they migrated,

49
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,229
hunter-gatherers were fundamentally nomadic,

50
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:54,066
which means that they never settled in one place for a long time,

51
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,488
they were always ready to kind of pick up,

52
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:58,814
probably their tents, and follow the herd,

53
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:01,076
or follow whatever animals they were hunting,

54
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:05,237
or follow the seasons so that they could go to

55
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,367
warmer climates maybe where there is more likely

56
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:11,660
to find something in the ground to eat maybe during the winter, who knows?

57
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,238
So the Paleolithic era is really distinguished

58
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:19,147
by that huge swath of time in human history

59
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,406
and it doesn't come to an end

60
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:25,366
until you get to the advent of FARMING.

61
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,235
So the Paleolithic Era, we are literally talking about

62
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:30,405
over 2 million years ago, it's when it starts,

63
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:32,818
before Homo sapiens even existed as a species

64
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:35,907
and it goes all the way to the advent of farming

65
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:42,231
that we believe first came about around 11,000 to 7,000 years ago.

66
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:45,405
And this abreviating right here, this BP

67
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:47,641
This does not stand for Brithish Petroleum,

68
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:51,570
it stands for "Before Present", or before the present time

69
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,149
so, one more acronym to kind of have in your toolkit when you see things.

70
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:58,813
And obviously, if we are 11,000 years before the present,

71
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:02,489
that's the same thing as 9,000 before Christ,

72
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,486
or before the common era

73
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:09,734
because Christ was, we believe, born 2,000 years ago.

74
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:13,485
Now, it may or may not be obvious to you,

75
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:17,236
but the advent of agriculture is a SUPER big deal.

76
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:22,409
Argueably the biggest deal in the development of human civilization.

77
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,573
Or in all of the human history!

78
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,231
And you might say,"Hey, what's the big deal about agriculture?"

79
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:30,069
These characters over here look pretty happy,

80
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,979
they are able to walk around a lot, they are able to hunt.

81
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:36,042
What's the big deal of all of the sudden people

82
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,820
plowing fields and domesticating cattle

83
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,903
and having chickens to lay eggs and whatever else?

84
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,741
And the big deal about that, besides the fact

85
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:46,366
that it would change peoples diet,

86
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:49,987
is that for the 1st time it allowed them to NOT be nomadic,

87
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:52,989
it allowed them to, and you could've probably had

88
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,488
some hunters who were somewhat settled,

89
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:58,400
maybe living near the ocean, fishing and all the rest

90
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,702
but for the most part, the development of agriculture,

91
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,153
it forced people to stay in one place

92
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:07,157
so you have the Paleolithic Era,

93
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:11,375
all the way to the advent of agriculture

94
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,573
which was about 11,000 - 7,000 years ago

95
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,237
and besides the fact that it changed people's diet

96
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,649
it allowed them to settle.

97
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:25,709
So agriculture allowed human beings to settle down in one area.

98
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,153
It wasn't just that they were settling in one area

99
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:31,150
but because they were able to control their enviroment

100
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,485
the were able to increase the density of things

101
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:36,496
of crops that humans could consume,

102
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,299
and animals that human could consume

103
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:41,067
and lower the density of crops that humans can't consume

104
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,153
and animals that they can't consume,

105
00:05:44,153 --> 00:05:47,151
or that they don't want around, like pests of some type.

106
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:52,330
What it allowed them to do is also settle in more dense environments.

107
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,149
You can imagine, when you just have people walking around

108
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:56,378
you need a lot of land to support

109
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,905
even the calory requirements of 1 human being.

110
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,825
But all of a sudden, if you are able to develop agriculture,

111
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,987
you are able to domesticate animals,

112
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:07,815
and so in the same amount of land you can have

113
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,908
more calories being generated,

114
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:11,985
and because you have more calories being generated

115
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,845
in a smaller amount of land, people can settle

116
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,151
and they can settle in a denser environment.

117
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,154
So agriculture was really this necessary requirement

118
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:29,571
for people to kind of develop civilization or to develop villages and cities.

119
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:33,406
And maybe also giving them free time to start thinking about:

120
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:36,323
"Hey, maybe we wanna think about how we can record what we know,

121
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:39,074
how we can develop even more technologies."

122
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:42,824
And so just to give us a sense of the categorization

123
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:45,556
that an archeologist would use for this different periods of time,

124
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,642
I told you we're still in the Paleolithic Era,

125
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,156
with the advent of stone tools, pre-humans

126
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:53,320
most of human time on this planet,

127
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,157
and then about 11,000 years ago the development of agriculture,

128
00:06:57,157 --> 00:07:00,042
and it developed independendtly in different places around the world,

129
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,836
which was by itself an interesting phenomenon

130
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:05,818
and people think that climate might have warmed up a little bit

131
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:09,575
so that maybe naturally there were some human-edible crops

132
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,572
that would exist in a little bit denser environment

133
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:13,654
and humans learned optimise that slowly

134
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,658
and they did that independently.

135
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,965
It's an interesting question of why did it develop

136
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:21,974
just then, after 180 or 190,000 years,

137
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,723
why did agriculture all of the sudden happen.

138
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:27,454
But just to get to terminology, the Paleolithic Era

139
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:29,571
is that period before agriculture,

140
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,568
and then once agriculture starts to develop,

141
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:36,486
we are now in the Neolithic Era.

142
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:39,736
And some archeologists would describe a transition period

143
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:42,298
between the Paleolithic and the Neolithic era,

144
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,069
called the Mesolithic.

145
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,985
And just to know what these words mean, because they actually

146
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,702
make sense when you know what they mean.

147
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,965
"Paleo" means "Old",

148
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:54,989
and "lithic" means "stone" or "old stone",

149
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,709
so they really talking about the Old Stone Age.

150
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:03,116
"Neolithic", as you can imagine, means "New stone",

151
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,156
so it's kind of the New Stone Age.

152
00:08:05,156 --> 00:08:11,232
And "Meso" means "Middle". So it is the Middle Stone Age.

153
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:14,636
So another way of thinking about this whole period

154
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:17,822
from when people were hunter- gatherers all the way

155
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:23,069
to about 11,000 - 7,000 years ago when they developed agriculture,

156
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,986
this whole period is called the Stone Age.

157
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,241
And the Stone Age is kind of the biggest age

158
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,697
and there are different ways of describing it.

159
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:33,735
Bacause if you just call it the Stone Age,

160
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:36,398
you are really making the importance out of the actuall tools

161
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:40,568
that people could shape, they weren't able to use matal at this point.

162
00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,994
When you refer to Paleolithic and Neolithic,

163
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:46,068
you are maybe referring a little bit more,

164
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,702
and there are other ways to think about it,

165
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:50,572
you are refering a little bit more to the lifestyle of the human beings,

166
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,739
Paelotihic being hunter-gatherers,

167
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:57,415
Neolithic having actually settled, starting to develop

168
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:01,326
kind of primitive villages and even cities

169
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:05,906
and of course Mesolithic is in between.

170
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:08,407
And just a word about a pop-culture reference,

171
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:12,365
you might have heard of the Paelolithic diet that some people are going on now,

172
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,074
and those are people who try to live like hunter-gatherers.

173
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:17,571
Their belief is that most of human evolution occured

174
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:22,570
while we were hunter-gatherers, and so that's what our bodies are most accustomed to,

175
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,074
so they like to eat meat and they like to eat a lot of nuts

176
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:30,071
and I've even met someone who used to eat only raw meat,

177
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,740
and I don't know if that's easy to justify

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,718
or if that's even somehow valid by the archeological records,

179
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:37,417
these people probably did cook their meet.

180
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,822
Now, the end of the Stone Age we would have, I would say

181
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:46,457
the number 2 most significant development in human history,

182
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:49,375
and now we're talking about 3,000 BC

183
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,739
which is about 5,000 years ago.

184
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,900
And this is the development of wiriting.

185
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,320
So we were hunter-gatherers, about 9 - 11 thousand years ago

186
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,983
people started developing argiculture,

187
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,906
allows them to settle in more dense environments

188
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:06,903
it also gives a little bit more free time

189
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:08,824
because they don't have to hunt and gather all the time

190
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,823
and then you go and once again, we'll probably discover things

191
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:14,658
as we go forward in time that maybe these days

192
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:16,599
need to be pushed back or whatever else,

193
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,577
we'll discover new civilizations, who knows,

194
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:23,070
but our best sense is: you have these villages and civilizations developing

195
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,614
and by about 5,000 years ago,

196
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,901
so this will be 5,000 before the present

197
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:32,918
or 3,000 BC, Before Christ,

198
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,906
you have people saying: hey, why don't we

199
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:37,984
start trying to write down what we know, so it doesn't...

200
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:41,907
you know, when I tell someone orally it does actually

201
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,571
lose information there, so let's slowly collect

202
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:48,075
all the knowledge we have and maybe accelerate,

203
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:50,572
we know they didn't explicitly think of these,

204
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,490
but let us write down what we know.

205
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,360
And so at about that period of time you have as far as we can tell

206
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,706
the first development of kind of a pictogram-based system of writing.

207
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:02,571
And the earliest system of writing we know

208
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:06,150
is cuneiform which is from the Sumerian civilization

209
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,320
which is now in present-day Iraq.

210
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,142
I was a really big deal. This is on some level

211
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:15,902
the beginning of recorded history.

212
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:19,569
We can talk about the world history, you can say the history

213
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,934
is all of the past and we can use the archeological record

214
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,235
to figure out stuff before people started to write things down

215
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,571
but when they started to write things down

216
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:30,326
now it was recorded, now we're actually getting

217
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:34,153
actuall accounts of what poeple know, of actuall people's knowledge.

218
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,817
And the reason why this is a big deal,

219
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,738
I mean, argiculture hopefully you now appreciate

220
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,297
that it was a pretty big deal,

221
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:43,190
but the reason why writing was a big deal

222
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,404
is that now civilization could collect its knowledge

223
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:49,098
it could build upon it, generation after generation,

224
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,403
without having to worry about people forgetting it

225
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:58,154
or information getting distorted verbally from ancestor to descendant.

226
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,405
And with that you also have the beginning of the Bronze Age.

227
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,155
The Bronze Age is kind of known from this beginning

228
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:07,376
even though it's referring to a material which comes from

229
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,032
the first time that people started using bronze

230
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:13,527
as a tool or using using bronze for their tools and weapons

231
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,489
and bronze, as you know, is a mixture of

232
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,975
mostly copper and a little bit of tin.

233
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:21,152
But the Bronze Age, at least in my mind, the biggest deal

234
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,077
of what started the beginning of the Bronze Age

235
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:26,070
really was the writing.

236
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,151
So once again, just as a review, because I actually find this kind of confusing.

237
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:35,502
Most of our current understanding, most of human pre-history

238
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:40,070
and even pre-human pre-history we spent as hunter-gatherers

239
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,662
using stone tools until about 11,000 years ago,

240
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,699
and then we became a little bit more settled,

241
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,735
we became farmers essentially using stone tools

242
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:54,488
and then you fast forward another about 5-6,000 years

243
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:57,490
and then we started to become farmers who started

244
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,789
to write down the things that we knew

245
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:03,000
and we started to use bronze tools.
