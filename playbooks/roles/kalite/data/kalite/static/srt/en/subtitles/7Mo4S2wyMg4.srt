1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
In the last couple of videos,
I already exposed you to the

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,210
idea of a matrix, which is
really just an array of

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,570
numbers, usually a 2-dimensional
array.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,500
Actually it's always
a 2-dimensional

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,220
array for our purposes.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,670
So if I have an m by n matrix,
the m is just the number of

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:24,960
rows, and then the n is just
the number of columns.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,565
So let me write out
the m by n matrix.

10
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:32,329
So I'll just specify, let's have
the m by n matrix A, it's

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,610
a capital bold A.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,050
And it is equal to, I'll be as
general as possible, first

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,180
entry is in, I'll just call that
lowercase a, it's in row

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,730
1 column 1.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,720
The next entry is
row 1 column 2.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,090
And you go all the way
to row 1 column

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,120
n, you have n columns.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,300
And then when you go down, you
go to the next row, it will be

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,640
row 2 column 1.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,170
And then you keep going
all the way down to

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,680
row m column n.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,410
And then of course, what?

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,140
This entry is going to be, row
2, let me write that a little

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,690
smaller, row 2 column 2.

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,560
And you go all the way, and
you're going to have

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,000
row m column n.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,990
And so if you think about it,
you're going to have how many

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,630
total entries here?

29
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,010
You're going to have m entries
this way, n that way.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,730
So you're going to m times
n total entries.

31
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,500
And I think you're pretty
familiar with this idea

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,440
already of a matrix, you
probably saw this in your

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,180
Algebra II classes.

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,860
So what we want to do now in
this video is relate our

35
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,600
notion of a matrix to everything
we already know

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,870
about vectors.

37
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,500
Or maybe introduce some
operations that allow matrix

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,130
and vectors to interact
with each other.

39
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,100
And maybe the most natural one
is multiplication, or taking

40
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,570
the product.

41
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,550
So what I'm going to do in this
video is define what it

42
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,460
means when we take the product
of our matrix A, of any matrix

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,880
A, I've written this as
general as possible,

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,130
with some vector x.

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:17,250
And our definition will only
work if x, the vector we're

46
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,780
multiplying A by, has
the same number of

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,920
components as A has columns.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:35,370
So this is only valid for an x
that looks like this: x1, x2,

49
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,465
all the way down to x n.

50
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:44,380
So let me be very clear with
this, this vector, I guess you

51
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,000
could do it a different height
than this vector.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,550
What matters is that the same
number of A's you have in this

53
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,880
direction, you have n A's
here, then you have n

54
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,430
components of this vector
right here.

55
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,080
And if you have that constraint,
if the length of

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,430
your vector, or the number of
components in vector is equal

57
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,640
to the number of columns in your
matrix, then we define

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,080
this product to be equal to --
so this is my vector x -- so

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,230
this is a definition.

60
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,610
There's nothing in nature that
told us it had to be

61
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,430
defined this way.

62
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,770
It's just human beings, or
mathematicians, decided that

63
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,180
this is a useful convention to
the define the multiplication,

64
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,180
or the product, of a matrix
and a vector.

65
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:29,360
So we'll define A times
our vector x.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,780
These are both bold, this is
a matrix, that's a vector.

67
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,420
And the convention, if I didn't
draw the little vector

68
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,620
symbol, your textbooks would
just bold out the x, so that

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,780
it'll be a lowercase x.

70
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,970
Lower case is vector, uppercase
is matrix, both of

71
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,670
them are bolded.

72
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,960
That tells you that you're
not just dealing

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,290
with regular numbers.

74
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,220
So we're defining this to be
equal to -- let me write it

75
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,732
out fairly large.

76
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,070
You're going to take each row,
and we're going to show you

77
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,200
that there's multiple ways to
kind of visualize this, but

78
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,350
it's going to a11 times x1,
let me write that down.

79
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:15,030
   

80
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:23,490
So a11 times x1 plus a12 times
x2, all the way to

81
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,050
plus a1n times xn.

82
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,960
   

83
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
So the product of this matrix,
this m by n matrix and this n

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,860
component vector, will be a new
vector, the first entry of

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,870
which is essentially each
of these entries times a

86
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,310
corresponding entry here,
and you add them all up.

87
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,470
And as you can see, that's
already looking fairly similar

88
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,400
to a dot product, and I'll
discuss that in a second.

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,280
But let me finish my definition
before I start

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,010
talking about what it
means, or what it

91
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,920
might be related to.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,660
So that was that first row
right there, it'll

93
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,550
just look like that.

94
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,870
We just multiply that
times this thing to

95
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,200
get that row there.

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,780
Now the second row -- I want to
do it in a different color

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,370
-- remember this is
a definition.

98
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,540
Human beings came
up with this.

99
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,720
Nothing about nature said we
had to do it this way, but

100
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,150
it's just nice and convenient.

101
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,770
So our second row will have a21
times x1, we'll just do

102
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,300
the whole thing over again,
but this time we're

103
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,560
multiplying this row times
this column vector.

104
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:42,095
So a21 times x1 plus a22 times
x2 all the way until we get to

105
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:49,620
-- I wanted to do that in
magenta -- a2n times xn.

106
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,870
So we multiplied this entire row
times that entire column.

107
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,520
This term times that term, plus
this term plus this term.

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,530
All the way down to plus
this last term

109
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,840
times that last term.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,870
And we keep doing this for every
row until we get to the

111
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,450
m-th row, and then the
m-th row will be am1.

112
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,060
   

113
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,260
This is the m-th row
first column.

114
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:26,320
am1 times x1 plus -- it's hard
to keep switching colors --

115
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:37,550
plus am2 times x2, all the way
until we get to amn times xn.

116
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,400
   

117
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,210
So what is this vector
going to look like?

118
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,020
It's essentially going to have
-- let's say we call this

119
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,200
vector-- Let's say it's
equal to vector b.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,240
What does vector b look like?

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,890
How many entries is
it going to have?

122
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,060
Well it has an entry for each
row of this, right?

123
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,090
We're taking each row and we're
essentially taking the

124
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,710
dot product of this row vector
with this column vector.

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,070
And I'll be a little bit
more formal with the

126
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,480
notation in a second.

127
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,660
But I think you understand that
this is a dot product.

128
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,720
The first component times the
first component plus the

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,280
second component times the
second component plus the

130
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,180
third component times the third
component, all the way

131
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,000
to the n-th component plus
the n-th component

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,200
times the n-th component.

133
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,555
So this is essentially the dot
product of this row vector.

134
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,910
   

135
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,230
We've been writing all of our
vectors as columns, so we

136
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,750
could call them column vectors,
you're just writing

137
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,730
them as rows.

138
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,250
And we can be a little bit
more specific with the

139
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,960
notation in a second, but what's
this going look like?

140
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,830
Well we're doing this
m times, so we're

141
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,010
going to have m entries.

142
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,660
You're going to b1 b2
all the way to bn.

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,760
If you viewed these all as
matrices, you can kind of view

144
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,880
it as -- and this will
eventually work for the matrix

145
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,670
math we're going to learn --
this is an m by n matrix and

146
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,730
we're multiplying it by -- how
many rows does this guy have?

147
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,210
He has n rows.

148
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,370
He has n components, and
he has 1 column.

149
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,560
So m by n times an n by 1, you
essentially can ignore these

150
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,610
middle two terms, and they'll
result with -- how many rows

151
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,390
does this guy have?

152
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,880
He has m rows, and 1 column.

153
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,320
These middle two terms have to
be equal to each other just

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,170
for the multiplication to be
defined, and then you're left

155
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,960
with an m by 1 matrix.

156
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,990
So this was all abstract, let
me actually apply it to some

157
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,610
actual numbers.

158
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,665
But it's important to actually
set the definition.

159
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,700
   

160
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,559
Now that we have the definition
we can apply it to

161
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,130
some actual matrices
and vectors.

162
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,260
So let's say we have
the matrix.

163
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:51,350
Let's say I want to multiply the
matrix minus 3, 0, 3, 2.

164
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,740
Now I'll do this
one in yellow.

165
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,070
1, 7, minus 1, 9.

166
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,880
And I want to multiply
that by the vector.

167
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,700
Now how many components,
or rows, does this

168
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
vector have to have?

169
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,620
Well my matrix times vector
product, or multiplication, is

170
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,650
only defined if my vector has
as many components as this

171
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,910
matrix has columns.

172
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,350
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4 columns.

173
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,990
So this guy's going to have 4
components for us even to be

174
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,520
able to multiply
them, otherwise

175
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,460
it wouldn't be defined.

176
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,640
So let me put 4 entries here.

177
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,750
Let's say it's 2, minus 3,
4, and then minus 1.

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,580
So what is this going
to be equal to?

179
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,370
   

180
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,730
The first term of this is going
to be the dot product of

181
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,100
this first row with
this vector.

182
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,360
And then the second entry is
going to be the dot product of

183
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,980
this row vector with
this column.

184
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,920
So let's do it.

185
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,170
So it's going to be minus 3
times 2, I'm not going to

186
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:05,990
color code it, minus 3 times 2
plus 0 times minus 3 plus 3

187
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,600
times 4 plus 2 times minus 1.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,540
   

189
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,590
And now my second row, or I
guess my second component in

190
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,220
this vector, is going to be 1
times 2 plus 7 times negative

191
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:33,050
3 plus minus 1 times 4
plus 9 times minus 1.

192
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,720
   

193
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,300
And so what does this
simplify to?

194
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:48,460
This is equal to minus 3 times
2 is minus 6 plus 0 plus 12.

195
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,670
This is 12.

196
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,700
Minus 2.

197
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:06,150
And then this is simplified to
2 minus 21 minus 4 minus 9.

198
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,450
So this is equal to this top
term, let's see, I have a

199
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,940
minus 6 plus 12 is
6 minus 2 is 4.

200
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:21,020
And then I have 2 minus
21 is minus 19.

201
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to make sure I get
the math right here.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,350
Minus 21 minus 9 is minus 30 and
I have a minus 34 and then

203
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,320
I have a plus 2, so minus 32.

204
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,550
So that's my product
right there.

205
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,010
And let me be very
clear right here.

206
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,400
Everything we've been used to
right now, we've been writing

207
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,610
our vectors as column vectors.

208
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:51,300
But you can view each of these
right here as a row vector.

209
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,740
But let me be even better.

210
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,540
Let's say that vector, let
me call vector a, a1.

211
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:09,500
So let me define vector a1 is
equal to minus 3, 0, 3, 2.

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:19,570
And let me define vector a2 to
be equal to 1, 7, minus 1, 9.

213
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,940
So all I did is I wrote these
guys, but I wrote them in our

214
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,100
standard vector form.

215
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,020
I wrote them as column
vectors.

216
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,550
So what we can define to turn
these guys into row vectors is

217
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,950
the transpose function.

218
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,300
In transpose, you just turn the
rows into columns and the

219
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,170
columns into rows.

220
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,980
So if this is a1, then a1
transpose will just be the row

221
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,920
version of this.

222
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,180
So it's minus 3, 0, 3, 2.

223
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:58,830
And then a2 transpose would be
equal to 1, 7, minus 1, and 9.

224
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,680
And then this multiplication
right here, we can rewrite it

225
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:10,650
as -- we have vector a1
transpose for the first row.

226
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,275
   

227
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,490
These are vectors now,
row vectors.

228
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,140
And then this is a2 transpose.

229
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,770
   

230
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,210
The transpose should be
the super script.

231
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,880
This vector can be written
exactly like this because this

232
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,280
is the first row, this
is the second row.

233
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,840
   

234
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:41,550
Times the vector, let me just
call this vector x, that right

235
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,016
there is vector x.

236
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:46,770
   

237
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,210
We can now rewrite the
definition as this would be

238
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,770
equal to what?

239
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:58,940
This first row right here
that we wrote out,

240
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,550
this was a1 dot x.

241
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,850
You know all about
the dot products.

242
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:14,960
The first row was a1 dot x.

243
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,860
It's minus 3 times 2 plus 0
times minus 3 plus 3 times 4.

244
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,760
It's a1 dot x.

245
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,680
And this is useful because
when I defined the dot

246
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,540
product, I only defined it with
column vectors like this.

247
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,720
And I'm dotting 2
column vectors.

248
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,030
I haven't formally defined
a row vector

249
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,430
times a column vector.

250
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,440
So now I can say if this is just
a standard column factor,

251
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,700
like we've been working with, I
can write my matrix as each

252
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,770
row is the transpose
of a column vector,

253
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,400
or it's a row vector.

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
Then I can write this product
as just the dot products of

255
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
each of these transpose, or
I guess you could say the

256
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,030
inverse transpose, with this
vector right here.

257
00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:02,060
And then obviously the second
row is going to be a2 dot x.

258
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,610
   

259
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,860
The second row is a2 dot x, is 1
times 2 plus 7 times minus 3

260
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,370
minus 1 times 4 plus
9 times minus 1.

261
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,950
So just like that.

262
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,430
So this is one way to view it.

263
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,870
Matrix times the vector is just
like the transpose of its

264
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,090
rows dotted with the vector
you're ds it by.

265
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,270
This is one way to perceive
matrix multiplication.

266
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,910
Now the other way to perceive
it -- let me do it with a

267
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,220
different example.

268
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,900
Those numbers are getting
a little bit tiresome.

269
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:55,860
Let's say I have the matrix A,
nice and bold, is equal to 3,

270
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:06,560
1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 7, 0, minus
1, 2, 3, and 4.

271
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,000
And I need to multiply this
times a 4 component vector.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:25,920
So let me call vector x is equal
to x1, x2, x3, and x4.

273
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,510
Now instead of viewing these as
row vectors, we could view

274
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,540
A as a set of column vectors.

275
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,650
We could call this thing
right here vector 1.

276
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,710
We call this thing right
here vector 2.

277
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,400
We call this thing right
here vector 3.

278
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
And we call this thing
right here vector 4.

279
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,440
Then we could rewrite our matrix
A as being equal to

280
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,380
just a bunch of column
vectors.

281
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,640
So we could rewrite it vector
1, vector 2, vector

282
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,709
3, and vector 4.

283
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,390
   

284
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,380
So how can the matrix
multiplication be interpreted

285
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,920
in this context?

286
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,170
Well what did we do?

287
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,930
   

288
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,079
When we multiply these guys,
all of the elements in here

289
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,369
always get multiplied by x1.

290
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,430
Let me start some of the
multiplication here, just from

291
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,700
our definition.

292
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:34,010
So if I multiply A times x,
I'll start it off, maybe I

293
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,980
won't do the whole thing.

294
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,990
I just want you to
see the pattern.

295
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:45,770
It's 3 times x1 plus 1 times
x2 plus 0 times x3

296
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,520
plus 3 times x4.

297
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,860
That's the first entry.

298
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,980
And then you have 2 times x1
plus 4 times x2 all the way.

299
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,140
And then you finally have
minus 1 times x1

300
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,210
plus 2 times x2.

301
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,440
You get the idea.

302
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,700
But what's happening here?

303
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,890
This first vector is always
being multiplied

304
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,460
by the scalar x1.

305
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,880
In fact you can view this part
of the entries right here.

306
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,880
We're just multiplying this guy
times the scalar of x1 in

307
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,780
every case.

308
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,440
You have 3, 2, minus
1, 3, 2, minus 1.

309
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,980
We're multiplying by
the scalar of x1.

310
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,480
And then we're adding that to
this guy times the scalar x2

311
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,400
and then we're adding that to
this guy times the scalar x3.

312
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:52,640
So we can rewrite A times x as
being equal to the scalar x1

313
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,510
times the vector v1 plus
the scalar x2.

314
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,700
This is the scalar x1 times the
vector v1 plus the scalar

315
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,460
x2 times the vector v2.

316
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,710
I want to do that in yellow.

317
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,100
   

318
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:23,570
Plus x3 times the vector
v3 plus the scalar x4

319
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,280
times the vector v4.

320
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,290
And obviously if we had n terms
here, we'd have to have

321
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,930
n vectors here, and we
could just make this

322
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,090
more general to n.

323
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,520
But what's interesting here is
now the product Ax can be

324
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,250
interpreted as a linear
combination.

325
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,910
These are just arbitrary numbers
depending on what our

326
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,070
vector x is.

327
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,310
So depending on our vector
x, we're taking a linear

328
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,950
combination of the column
vectors of A.

329
00:19:50,950 --> 00:20:01,070
So this is a linear
combination of

330
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,410
column vectors of A.

331
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,680
So this is really interesting.

332
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,510
I'm sure you've been exposed
to matrix multiplication in

333
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,050
the past. But I really want you
to absorb these two ways

334
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,100
of interpreting it, because
they'll be important when we

335
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,490
talk about column spaces
and things

336
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,740
like that in the future.

337
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,830
   

338
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,680
Actually there's other ways
you can actually interpret

339
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,800
that as a transformation
of this vector x.

340
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,910
But I won't cover that in this
video just for brevity.

341
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,310
But you can interpret it as a
weighted combination, or a

342
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,710
linear combination of the column
vectors of A, where the

343
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,360
matrix X dictates what
the weights on each

344
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,700
of the columns are.

345
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,360
Or you can interpret it as,
essentially, the dot product

346
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,840
of the row vectors, or you could
define the row vectors

347
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,670
as a transpose of
column vectors.

348
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,250
The dot product of those column
vectors, each of the

349
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,240
corresponding column vectors,
with your matrix X.

350
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,750
So these are both completely
valid interpretations, and

351
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,090
hopefully this video at least
gives you a working knowledge

352
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,720
of what matrix multiplication
is.

353
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,480
And even better, gives you a
little bit deeper sense of all

354
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,390
of the different ways that
it can be interpreted.

355
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,333
