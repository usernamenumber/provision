00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,430
Welcome to the presentation on exponents.

2
00:00:04,696 --> 00:00:07,012
If I were to ask you what

3
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:11,570
-- let me make sure this pen is the right width--

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,860
if I were to ask you what two times three is,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,110
well I think at this point this should be pretty easy for you.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,190
That's the same thing as two plus two plus two, which equals six.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,840
You didn't have to do this.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,595
You all know that two times three is equal to six.

9
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,465
So what we're going to do now is

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:37,136
we're going to learn exponents which are the same thing

11
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:41,730
that multiplication is to addition, exponents are to multiplication.

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,163
I'll explain that in a second.

13
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:44,740
I know that probably confused you.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,380
If I were to say what two to the third power is,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,709
instead of two plus two plus two,

16
00:00:52,709 --> 00:01:02,070
this is equal to two times two times two, which equals eight.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,640
Or if I were to say three the second power,

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,160
that is equal to three times three.

19
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:19,870
Remember, I said three times two would be three plus three.

20
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,620
So the first three times three this equals nine,

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,940
and three plus three equals six.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,165
The reason why I'm doing this is because there's always this temptation

23
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,504
when you first learn exponents is to multiply.

24
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:33,812
When I first learned it and I saw three to the second power or three squared,

25
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,631
I'd always be like oh, that's six.

26
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:37,898
But you also remember it's three times three,

27
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,035
which equals nine.

28
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's do some more problems.

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,710
If I were to tell you negative four squared.

30
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,969
Once again, that's the same thing as

31
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:01,250
negative four times negative four.

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, we all learn from multiplying negative numbers

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,540
that a negative times a negative is a positive.

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,861
And then four times four,

35
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,029
well this equals positive sixteen.

36
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,584
You don't have to write the positive,

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,369
I'm just doing that for emphasis.

38
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:19,584
If I would ask you what negative four to the third power is,

39
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:26,440
well that equals negative four times negative four

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,620
times negative four.

41
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,340
Well we know already that negative four times negative four,

42
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,130
that this equals sixteen, positive sixteen,

43
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,470
and then we multiply that times negative four.

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,490
And then that equals minus sixty-four.

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,720
So something very interesting here to observe.

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,267
When I took a negative number,

47
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,968
and we call this the base,

48
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,134
when the base is negative,

49
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,454
in this case, negative four,

50
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,248
and I raise it to an even power,

51
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:55,552
I got a positive number, right?

52
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,553
Negative four to an even power is positive sixteen,

53
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,600
and when I took a negative number to an odd power, to three,

54
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,984
I got a negative number.

55
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,332
And that makes sense because every time

56
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:08,298
you multiply by a negative number again,

57
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:09,749
it switches signs.

58
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:12,189
I'll show you the, I guess you'd call it

59
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,939
the simplest example.

60
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:18,580
Negative one to the one power is equal to negative one, right?

61
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,930
Because that's just negative one times itself one time.

62
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,877
And if I said negative one squared,

63
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:29,435
well that's negative one times negative one,

64
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,418
well that equals positive one.

65
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:39,584
But if I said negative one to the third power,

66
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:44,750
once again that's negative one times negative one times negative one.

67
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,850
Well now this equals negative one times negative one is positive one

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,340
times negative one equals negative one again.

69
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,803
So I could tell you

70
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:56,070
what negative one to the fifty-first power is.

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,892
Because fifty-one is odd,

72
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:01,322
we know that that is equal to negative one.

73
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,250
If it was a fifty then it would be a positive one.

74
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,510
Hope I didn't confuse you too much.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,932
Let's do a couple more problems.

76
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:13,059
If I asked you what five to the third power is,

77
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:19,207
well that will go into five times five times five,

78
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,601
which equals one hundred and twenty-five.

79
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:23,935
So really if I were ask to ask

80
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,703
what negative five to the third power is,

81
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:36,326
that would be negative five times negative five times negative five,

82
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,910
which would be negative one hundred and twenty-five.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,686
Now one principle of exponents

84
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:45,060
that might not seem completely intuitive to you at first

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,869
is when I raise something to the zero power.

86
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:51,111
So let's say I had two to the zero power.

87
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:54,200
It turns out that anything to the zero power is equal to one.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,442
So two to the zero power is one,

89
00:04:56,442 --> 00:05:00,384
three to the zero power is equal to one,

90
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:07,471
negative nine hundred to the zero power is equal to one.

91
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,571
And let me see if I can give you a little bit of intuition of

92
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:13,009
why that is actually the case.

93
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,981
So if I were to ask you,

94
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:23,231
let's do three to the fourth power.

95
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:29,265
That equals three times three times three times three,

96
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,249
which equals eighty-one.

97
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:38,200
three to the third power is equal to twenty-seven,

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,132
this three times three times three.

99
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,930
three to second power is equal to nine.

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,790
three to the first power is equal to three.

101
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,753
Now we're going to say what's three to zero power?

102
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:56,357
Well we already know, I already told you the rule,

103
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,103
anything with the zero power is equal to one,

104
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,040
but this will hopefully give you some intuition.

105
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,490
When we went from the fourth power to the third power,

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,640
we divided by three, right?

107
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,240
eighty-one divided by three is twenty-seven.

108
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,048
When you went from the third power to the second power,

109
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,490
we divided by three.

110
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,230
When we went from the second power from nine to three,

111
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,350
we divided by three.

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,744
So it kind of makes logical sense that

113
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,478
when we go from the first power to the zero power,

114
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,911
we'll just divide by three again.

115
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,890
So three divided by three is one.

116
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,032
Hopefully that gives you a little bit of an intuitive sense.

117
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:33,480
You might want to replay that and think about why that is.

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,270
And there's actually other aspects of exponents that

119
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,719
why this also makes sense,

120
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,683
why something to the zero power

121
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,202
is equal to one.

122
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:42,960
But let's just do some more problems in the time we have.

123
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,750
I don't want to get you too confused.

124
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,600
So if I were to ask you seven squared,

125
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,720
well that's seven times seven, that's forty-nine.

126
00:06:53,797 --> 00:07:00,789
If I asked you negative six to the third power

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,419
-- parentheses around here so you know it's a whole negative six to the third power--

128
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,086
that equals negative six times negative six times negative six.

129
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:15,319
Negative six times negative six is positive thirty-six times negative six,

130
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,730
and that equals what?

131
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,127
It's one hundred and eighty and thirty-six,

132
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,164
that's minus two hundred and sixteen,

133
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,296
if my mental math is correct.

134
00:07:24,296 --> 00:07:27,332
You could have actually multiplied it out.

135
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:31,200
I think you're getting the point at this point.

136
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,344
Oh, and another thing,

137
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,176
if I told you zero to the hundredth power,

138
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:36,290
well, that's pretty easy.

139
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,021
That's zero times itself one hundred times,

140
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,940
which is still equal to zero.

141
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:49,340
If I were to ask you one to the thousandth power,

142
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,370
well that's just equal to one, right?

143
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,930
You can multiply one by itself as many times as you want

144
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,750
and you're still going to get one.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,430
And remember, if I had negative one to the one thousandth power,

146
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,910
well, this is an even exponent so you're still going to get one.

147
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,960
If it was negative one to the one thousand and one,

148
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,870
then it would be negative one.

149
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,672
I think you remember why this is,

150
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:12,540
because when you multiply a negative times itself an even number of times,

151
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,550
the negatives cancel out.

152
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,445
And then if you multiply it by a negative one more time

153
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,970
it becomes a negative number again.

154
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,430
Well let's just do some normal problems.

155
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,699
I just want to make sure you get the basics of exponents down.

156
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,682
If I were to tell you

157
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:28,132
-- let me think of a good one--

158
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,330
eight squared,

159
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,947
that equals eight times eight equals sixty-four.

160
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,442
If I were to tell you twenty-five squared,

161
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:46,880
that's twenty-five times twenty-five, which equals six hundred and twenty-five.

162
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,870
Powers of two is always very interesting.

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,639
It's especially interesting

164
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,860
if you one day go into computer science.

165
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,496
So two to the fourth power,

166
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:59,820
that's two times two times two times two.

167
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,750
So two times two is four so this equals sixteen.

168
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,350
And I did something very interesting here

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
kind of on purpose.

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:18,210
Notice that two to the fourth is equal to four times four, right?

171
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,370
Because we did four times four here.

172
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,678
I'm going to detail this more later on,

173
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,020
but I want to think about what that means.

174
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,070
Because four itself is the same thing as two squared.

175
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,094
So we learned, just real fast,

176
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:30,381
two to the fourth is the same thing

177
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:34,130
as two squared times two squared.

178
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,742
So I'll let you sit and think about that,

179
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,727
but other than that I think you have the general idea

180
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,430
of how basic exponents work,

181
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:43,891
and I think you're ready to try the level one exponent module.

182
00:09:43,891 --> 99:59:59,999
have fun.
