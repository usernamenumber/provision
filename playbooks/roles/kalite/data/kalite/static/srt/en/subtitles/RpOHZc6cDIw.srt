00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,664
In the video on black holes

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:08,233
several people asked what is actually a pretty good question, which is: If the mass of

3
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,958
say a black hole is only 2 or 3 solar masses,

4
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:16,459
why is the gravity so strong? Obviously the sun's gravity isn't so strong

5
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:21,877
that it keeps light from escaping. So, why would something or even a star that is 2 or 3 solar masses,

6
00:00:21,915 --> 00:00:24,800
it's gravity isn't so strong that it keeps light from escaping

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,400
why would a black hole that has the same mass keep light from escaping?

8
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,892
And to understand that, let's just think a little bit about it.

9
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll just do a Newtonian

10
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,623
classical physics right here.

11
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:40,187
I wont get into the whole general relativity and things.

12
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:45,287
This will really just give us the intuition of why a smaller, denser thing with the same mass

13
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,638
can exert a stronger gravitational pull.

14
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:52,005
So let's imagine-- so let's take two examples

15
00:00:52,215 --> 00:00:58,190
Let's say I have some star here

16
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,292
that has a mass-- let's just call that mass m1

17
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:08,207
and let's say that its radius,

18
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,551
lets just call this "r"

19
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:12,327
and lets say that I have

20
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:16,363
some other mass right at the surface

21
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:19,458
of this star. Somehow able to survive those surface temperatures

22
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:21,704
and this mass over here

23
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:25,041
has a mass of m2.

24
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:32,574
The Universal Law of Gravitation tells us that the force between these two

25
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:38,595
masses is going to be equal to the gravitational constant

26
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:41,217
times the product of the masses.

27
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:48,100
So m1 times m2

28
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,974
all of that over the square of the distance

29
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:54,045
"r" squared.

30
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:57,734
Now, let me be very clear.You might say: Wait, this magenta mass

31
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,878
right here is touching this larger mass.

32
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:01,270
Isn't the distance 0?

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,608
You need to be very careful!

34
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:06,415
This is the distance between their center of masses.

35
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:14,118
So the center of mass of this large mass over here is "r" away from this mass on the surface

36
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:16,723
Now, with that said, let's take another example.

37
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:22,974
Let's say this large massive star or whatever it might be, eventually condenses

38
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,630
into something a thousand times smaller.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,354
So let me draw it like this.Obviosly I'm not drawing it to scale.

40
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:36,519
So let's say we have another case like this (I'm not drawing it to scale)

41
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,379
So this object, maybe it's the same object or maybe it's a different object,

42
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:47,592
but it has the exactly same mass as larger object, but now has a much smaller radius.

43
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:57,213
So that radius now is 1/1000.Let's say it's 1/1000 of this radius over here.

44
00:02:57,213 --> 00:03:04,598
So it's r/1000.If this had a million kilometer radius,

45
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:08,731
so that will make it roughly about twice the radius of the sun.

46
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:11,571
And this was a million kilometer radius right over here.

47
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:14,131
This would be a thousand kilometer radius,

48
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,444
so maybe we are talking about something that is approaching a neutron star.

49
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:22,377
But we don't have to think about what it actually is,just think about the thought experiment here.

50
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:25,808
So,let's say I have this thing over here and let's say I have something

51
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:31,685
on the surface of this.So let's say I have the same mass that's on the surface of this thing.

52
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,777
So, this is m2 right over here.

53
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:39,992
So, what's going to be the force between these 2 masses?

54
00:03:39,992 --> 00:03:47,915
What's the force pulling them together?So that's the Universal Law of Gravitation again.

55
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:52,229
The force, let's just call this F1(force 1) and let's just call this F2(force 2).

56
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,838
Once again, it's going to be the gravitation constant, times the product of the masses

57
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:05,798
So, the big m1, times the smaller mass m2, all of that over this distance squared.

58
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,115
This radius squared.

59
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,638
Remember, it's the distance to the center of masses.

60
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:12,152
This center of mass here we are considering m2 to the kind of view

61
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,759
just to point match right over there.

62
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,659
So what's the radius squared?

63
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:22,367
It's going to be "r" over 1 thousand squared ( r/(1000^2)).

64
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,782
Or, if we simplify this,what would this be?

65
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:35,090
This is the same thing as the gravitational constant times m1 times m2

66
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:46,469
over "r" squared over 1 thousand squared or over 1 million.That's just a thousand squared.

67
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:50,131
Or, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 1 million

68
00:04:50,131 --> 00:05:01,371
and this is going to be equal to 1 million times the gravitational constant

69
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:06,131
times m1 times m2, all of that over "r" squared.

70
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,659
Now, what's this things right over here?

71
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:18,736
That's the same thing as the F1.So this is going to be 1 million times F1.

72
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:23,715
So, even though the masses involved are the same, this yellow object right here

73
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:27,577
is the same mass as this larger object over here.

74
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:33,592
It's able to exert a million times the gravitational force on this point of mass

75
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:38,279
So they are both being attracted.They are both exerting this on each other.

76
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,736
And the reality is that because this thing is smaller,because this m1 on the right here,

77
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:48,248
this one I'm coloring in,because this one is smaller and denser, this particle is able to

78
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,244
get closer to its center of mass.

79
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:55,577
Now you might be saying: Ok,well..I can buy that.That you know, this just come straight

80
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:59,592
from the universal law of gravitation.But what if something closer to this center of mass

81
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,754
experience the same thing?

82
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:09,531
If this is a star, wouldn't photons that are over here wouldn't this experience the same force

83
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:16,998
If this distance right here is "r" over a thousand(r/1000), wouldn't some photon here or

84
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:23,018
atom here or molecul or whatever it's over here, wouldn't that experience the same force?

85
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:26,464
This milllion times the force of this thing and you got to remember,

86
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:30,925
all of the sudden when this thing is inside of this larger mass, what's happening?

87
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:39,802
The entire mass is no longer pulling on it in that direction.It's no longer pulling it in that inward direction.

88
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:56,100
You now have all of this mass over here is pulling it in outward direction.

89
00:06:56,115 --> 00:07:02,767
All that mass is doing is that mass itself is being pulled inword.

90
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:07,162
It is pushing down on this.It is exerting pressure on that point.

91
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:14,705
But, the actual gravitational force that that point is experiencing is actually going to be less, it's actually going to me mitigated

92
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:22,715
by the fact that there are so much mass over here pulling in the other direction.

93
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:32,223
So, you can imagine that if you are in the center of a really massive object,

94
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:38,310
there will be no gravitational force being pulled on you,because you are at the center of the mass

95
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:45,018
The rest of the mass is outward,so at every point it will be pulling you outward.

96
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:47,648
So, that's why you as you enter the core of the star,

97
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:49,859
you will get a lot closer to the center of the mass.

98
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:54,679
It's not goint to be pulling on you with this type of force and the only way you can get this

99
00:07:54,679 --> 00:08:01,044
type of forces is if the entire mass is contained in a very dense region,

100
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,171
in a very small region.

101
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:07,423
And that's why a black hole is able to exert such strong gravity that

102
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,675
not even light can escape.

103
00:08:09,675 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.
