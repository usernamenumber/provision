1
00:00:00,538 --> 00:00:04,054
What I want to do in this video is a calculus proof of the famous

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:07,862
centripetal acceleration formula that tells us the magnitude

3
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,824
of centripetal acceleration, the actual direction will change

4
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:14,901
it's always going to be pointing inwards, but the magnitude of centripetal acceleration is equal to the

5
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:19,235
magnitude of the velocity-squared divided by the radius

6
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:23,082
I want to be very clear, this is a scalar formula right over here; we're talking about the magnitude

7
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:26,410
of the acceleration and the magnitude of the velocity. If these were vectors,

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,045
we would have arrows drawn over it. So this really, I don't want people to get confused

9
00:00:30,045 --> 00:00:34,313
because this is a v, this is really referring to the speed-squared.

10
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,859
and this is the magnitude, and these are all

11
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,094
scalar quantities. So to do that, let's imagine some

12
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:45,366
object, maybe it's some object in orbit around a planet or something,

13
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:48,830
so let's say that's the planet, and you have some object

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,087
that is in orbit around the planet, and it is going in a counter-clockwise

15
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:56,273
direction, and so let's specify its position vector as

16
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,657
a function as time.

17
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,199
So that is its position vector and it is going to

18
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,999
change as a function of time as this thing spins around

19
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:11,569
We're going to assume, for the purposes of this

20
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,430
proof.

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,893
So that is our

22
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:23,307
y-axis, and this is our x-axis.

23
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:27,532
We're going to define theta as the angle between the positive

24
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:30,051
x-axis and our vector.

25
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,199
And we're going to assume this thing is in orbit with the radius of r. So the

26
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,284
magnitude of our position vector, even though the direction is going to change

27
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:43,400
the magnitude of our position vector is not going to change. It's always going to have

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,068
length r. So this is going in a circle with radius r.

29
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:50,345
The magnitude of our position vector,

30
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:54,635
which is changing as a function of time, is going to be

31
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:58,628
r. So how can we write

32
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:03,348
the position vector in terms of its components at any given time?

33
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:06,881
We can write the position vector, and I'll do it in engineering notation,

34
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,562
and so you might want to review those videos if some of this looks foreign and I'll

35
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:14,026
do a bit of basic trigonometry in breaking down the vector into its components

36
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,557
and I encourage you to review some of those videos if some of that looks a bit

37
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:23,006
daunting. If you take the position vector at any time,

38
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:25,263
the magnitude is r,

39
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,475
this angle is theta,

40
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:33,274
its x-component, in blue,

41
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:37,905
this vector right over here, the magnitude of the vector, I should say,

42
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:41,380
is going to be r cosine of theta

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,512
We learned that this came from basic trigonometry when we started

44
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:48,443
two-dimensional projectile motion, we saw how to break these

45
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:55,263
vectors down into its components, and the y-component of this vector

46
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:58,457
is going to be r sine of theta

47
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:03,989
So this is going to be r sine of

48
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:09,113
theta. So the position vector at any time

49
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:11,972
can be written as a sum of its x- and y-components.

50
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:15,083
So it's the magnitude of its x-component, it's going to be

51
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:20,174
r cosine of theta, and I could write theta as a function of

52
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:23,886
time if I'd like, but I'm just going to write r cosine of theta

53
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:27,035
actually, let me write it that way, so it shows theta is a function of time

54
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:30,503
This thing is moving, and there's going to be that times the

55
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:34,870
i-unit vector, we're in engineering notation over here.

56
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,353
So that's the i-unit vector, it tells us that the x-component

57
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:42,507
is going in the positive x direction. Plus

58
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:45,479
the magnitude of the y-component, which is

59
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,443
r sine of theta, which is going to be a function of time.

60
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:54,715
So to be clear, the function of time applies to the theta.

61
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:58,371
And that is going

62
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,603
in the j-direction.

63
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:05,284
So that is our j-unit vector.

64
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,774
So now we have position as a function of theta

65
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:14,122
which is actually a function of time. So let's take the derivative of

66
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:19,627
this thing right here. So what is

67
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:26,818
the derivative of our position vector with respect to time

68
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:30,754
Well that's just going to be our velocity vector,

69
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:34,625
as a function of time, and it's going to be equal to

70
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,375
we just have to take the derivative of each of these parts with respect to

71
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,222
time. And you just do the chain rule. So you're going to have

72
00:04:42,222 --> 00:04:45,646
the r sit outside cause that's just a constant. So you're going to have r

73
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:50,277
the derivative of cosine of theta t with respect to theta t

74
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:53,523
So I'm just doing the chain rule right over here. That's going to be

75
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:58,361
negative sine of theta t

76
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,746
and then as the chain rule, we also have to multiply that

77
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:04,705
times the derivative of the theta of t

78
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:10,122
with respect to t. So times d-theta, dt

79
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:12,929
so this is just the chain rule right over here.

80
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:16,882
So that's going to be how it's changing in the x-direction, and in the y-direction

81
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:19,999
we do something very similar. In the y-direction

82
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,305
we take the same derivative. We have the r scalar out front

83
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:26,964
r, and then the derivative of sine of theta

84
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:31,030
with respect to theta is going to be cosine of theta

85
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,947
and I'll write it as a function of time, and then do the chain rule

86
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:39,513
you'll also have to multiply that by the rate at which theta is changing with respect to t,

87
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:42,885
times d-theta, dt,

88
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:50,287
and this is all going to be times our j-unit vector. Now,

89
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:54,418
there's something you might already realize, and you should rewatch the video

90
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:57,691
on angular velocity if this is foreign to you, but

91
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,759
d-theta, dt, this is our angular velocity.

92
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,741
That's why I said to rewatch that video. This right over here, the rate at which

93
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:09,333
the angle changes with respect to time, that is angular velocity.

94
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:13,314
So this right over here is

95
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:17,311
angular velocity. And for the sake of this

96
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:21,362
video, this is an assumption we'll have to make for this formula right over here

97
00:06:21,362 --> 00:06:25,432
we're going to assume, that omega, which is the rate of change

98
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:28,315
of our angle with respect to time, we're going to assume

99
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:31,931
that this is constant.

100
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:36,911
So this is an assumption we're making for this proof. This is we are going

101
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,357
to assume that omega is constant. And if omega is

102
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:44,227
constant, then we can treat it as a constant and we can factor

103
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:47,413
it out of this expression. So let's factor out

104
00:06:47,413 --> 00:06:52,948
a negative omega-r from this expression over here. So we can rewrite

105
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:56,420
our velocity as a function of time is equal to

106
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,285
I'm going to factor out a negative omega

107
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,420
times r, and if you factor out a negative omega-r,

108
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,681
what you're left with is

109
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:10,896
this first term,

110
00:07:14,215 --> 00:07:20,069
sine of theta-t

111
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:25,932
And I didn't have to make it explicit that theta is a function of t, but this makes it explicit

112
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:30,920
that theta is a function of t, and then times

113
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,772
our i-unit vector,

114
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:39,531
plus, so if we're factoring out

115
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:44,312
a negative omega-r, this becomes negative

116
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,817
cosine of theta,

117
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:51,164
which is a function of t, and that

118
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:55,544
is times our j-unit vector.

119
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,389
So we factored out

120
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,114
a negative omega-r. Now let's take the derivative of

121
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:05,784
this with respect to time. So if we take

122
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:09,999
the derivative of velocity

123
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,964
with respect to time, this is clearly just what the acceleration is

124
00:08:13,964 --> 00:08:17,515
as a function of time, and we're going to assume that the magnitude of this thing

125
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:21,048
is constant, but the actual direction is changing, so this is the acceleration

126
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:26,564
as a function of time, is going to be equal to

127
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:29,620
this negative

128
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,656
omega-r, so what is the derivative of

129
00:08:32,656 --> 00:08:36,935
this thing right over here? So the derivative of sine with respect to theta,

130
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:38,581
we're just doing the chain rule here,

131
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,635
the derivative of sine with respect to theta

132
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:46,828
is going to be cosine of theta

133
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:49,049
as a function of t.

134
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:52,464
And then chain rule, we also have to take that and multiply it with the derivative of theta

135
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,701
with respect to t.

136
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:59,788
I could write d-theta, dt here

137
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:03,759
But that once again, is just omega.

138
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,043
So that is just omega, and that of course

139
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:12,774
is in the i-direction. And from that,

140
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:14,808
and next to that, we take the derivative of

141
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:19,515
cosine of theta of t with respect to theta, so that's going to be

142
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:23,115
that would be negative sine of theta, so we would have a negative out front

143
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:27,543
so it becomes positive sine of

144
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,942
theta as a function of t.

145
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:35,396
And then we have to do the chain rule, the derivative of theta with respect to t.

146
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:38,125
We have to multiply by this, and for that we could write

147
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,806
d-theta, dt right there, but that again is the same thing

148
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,824
as omega. And all that is being multiplied by the

149
00:09:45,824 --> 00:09:48,728
j-unit vector.

150
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,998
So now let's factor out this other omega, and we get something interesting,

151
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:58,795
we get the acceleration vector as a function of

152
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:02,513
time is equal to, and if we factor out another omega, we get

153
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:06,455
negative omega-squared r,

154
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:11,224
I'm just factoring out another negative omega,

155
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:16,550
times, and I'll write it in parentheses here,

156
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,040
cosine of theta

157
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,025
as a function of t

158
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:26,668
times our i-unit vector

159
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,707
plus

160
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:34,025
sine of theta, which is a function of t

161
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:37,659
times our j-unit vector.

162
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:45,467
Now what is all of this business right over here?

163
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,401
Just look at this part right over here, well r times this,

164
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:53,813
especially if you distributed the r, that is exactly this thing right over here

165
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:57,462
If you distribute the r, you get exactly r cosine theta as a function

166
00:10:57,462 --> 00:11:01,241
of t times our i-unit vector plus our sine theta as a

167
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:06,582
function of t times the j-unit vector. So everything that I squared-off in orange right over here,

168
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:13,135
this is our position vector as a function of time.

169
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:14,975
So all that work we did, we just got a

170
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:19,135
very interesting result. We got that our acceleration vector

171
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:23,384
as a function of time is equal to the negative

172
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:32,767
of our constant angular velocity-squared

173
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,829
times our position vector

174
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:37,928
And just to be clear, angular velocity is kind of the pseudo vector,

175
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:42,248
it tends to be treated like a scalar, especially when you're dealing with two-dimensionals

176
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:47,311
like this, it's really a pseudo scalar, but let's just go with this.

177
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:51,294
We're assuming this right over here is a constant scalar quantity.

178
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:55,721
Now, we're very very very very close here.

179
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:58,978
Now what we want to do is to relate this

180
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,591
this is essentially the scalar version of it, so if we wanted

181
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,774
to take the magnitudes of both sides,

182
00:12:05,774 --> 00:12:10,021
so we're saying the acceleration vector is equal to this constant times

183
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:19,116
the position vector, so let's take the magnitude of both sides of this thing

184
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:22,615
So then we get the magnitude of the acceleration vector,

185
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,462
which I'm just going to call a sub c,

186
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,880
is going to be equal to

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,790
you could say the magnitude of this negative omega-squared

188
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,645
but when you take the magnitude, it's like taking the absolute value

189
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:35,464
in fact, absolute value is just the one-dimensional version of magnitude,

190
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,107
that's just going to be positive omega-squared

191
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,488
we don't care about the direction, sign gives us the direction, we just care about

192
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:48,076
the actual size. So this is going to be

193
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:50,255
the magnitude of negative omega-squared

194
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:54,642
times the magnitude of our position vector

195
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:58,517
the magnitude of omega-squared is just going to be omega-squared

196
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,797
you can get rid of the sign, and the magnitude of our position vector

197
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:05,167
we saw at the beginning of this video, is just r,

198
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,563
our radius

199
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:13,277
so this right over here is just going to be equal to

200
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,051
the radius of the circle that we're going around.

201
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,884
Now, we also know the angular velocity, or

202
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:24,367
the magnitude of the angular velocity, is equal to the

203
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:28,433
magnitude of our velocity, or the speed of our

204
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:32,101
object, divided by the radius of the circle

205
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:35,913
that it is going around. So we could substitute that right over here.

206
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:42,648
So if we square it, this is going to be (v over r)-squared, now we saw that in the video on angular velocity,

207
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,687
times r

208
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,424
and this is all going to be the magnitude of our acceleration,

209
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:51,490
which is really our centripetal acceleration, our inward directed acceleration.

210
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:56,021
So this is going to be equal to, and I think you see where this is going,

211
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:59,869
This is equal to v-squared over r-squared

212
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:02,970
times r, but this r cancels out

213
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,688
with the r-squared, so you're just left with v-squared

214
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,004
over r, and you're done!

215
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:13,654
The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is equal to your speed,

216
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:17,161
the magnitude of your velocity, squared, divided by

217
00:14:17,161 --> 99:59:59,999
your radius. And, we are done.
