1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,010
We're now on problem number 28.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,010
And the question is, is x an integer?

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,080
Statement one tells us that x over 2 is an integer.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
So xŁŹif you think about it, has to be an integer,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,060
because x is divisible by 2.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,810
This tells us that x is divisible by 2,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,390
because when I divide by 2 it's not 5.5 or something.

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,810
I get an even-- I get an integer.

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,970
So x has to be an integer.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,770
And if you want to use an example,

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,700
well if x is divisible by 2,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,780
then x could be 6, which is clearly--

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,570
well anyway, that's almost too obvious.

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,160
I don't think I have to explain this too much.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,600
But this alone is enough to know that x is an integer,

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,040
because it's actually divisible by 2.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,090
Statement number two tells us that 2x is an integer.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,050
This doesn't give me a lot of information.

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,990
Because if x is equal to 1/2, then 2x is equal to 1.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,650
So that 2x is an integer, but x is not an integer.

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,030
But if x is equal to one, then 2x is equal to 2.

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,460
And so 2x being an integer,

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,770
doesn't necessarily tell me whether or not x is an integer.

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,350
So this is useless, and this is useful.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,780
So the answer is one,

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,510
that only statement number one is necessary.

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,050
A.

28
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,300
Problem 29.

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,000
I should write smaller so I could save space.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,040
What is the value of x? Simple enough.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,050
The first one says, 2x plus 1 is equal to 0.

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,940
Like I said before, you could just look at this and say,

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,000
this is eighth grade algebra.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,020
I can solve for x. This is all I need.

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,190
And you could solve for it if you want.

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,220
You could say 2x is equal to minus 1,x is equal to minus 1/2.

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,250
But that would be a waste of time,

38
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,270
because they're not asking you what x actually equals,

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,020
they're just ask you whether you could solve for it.

40
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,470
Two says, this is interesting.

41
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,660
x plus 1 squared is equal to x squared.

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,270
Now you might be tempted to just take the square root of

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,900
both sides.

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,150
But that actually becomes complicated,

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,860
because you could have the positive or negative square roots.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,700
You'd have to set up a bunch of different equations.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,460
The easiest thing to do actually would be to expand this.

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,660
So what's x plus 1 squared?

49
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,660
What's x plus 1 times x plus 1?

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:41,000
So that's x squared plus 2x plus 1 is equal to x squared.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,530
And if you subtract x squared from both sides of this equation

52
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,250
you get 2x plus 1 is equal to 0.

53
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,010
So you actually end up getting this again.

54
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,010
So both of these pieces of information are equivalent.

55
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,420
And each of them independently is enough to solve for x.

56
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,280
So the answer is D.

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,010
Each statement alone is sufficient.

58
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,090
Problem number 30.

59
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:16,050
What is the value of 1 over k plus 1 over r?

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,020
What they give us, what information do they give us?

61
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,030
So they tell us that k plus r is equal to 20.

62
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,730
It's not obvious to me how to figure out from this,

63
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,660
what 1 over k plus 1 over r is.

64
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,620
And just to experiment,

65
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,120
if we were to find a common denominator and add these together

66
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,020
what is another way of writing this expression?

67
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,070
Well the common denominator would be kr.

68
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,000
And 1 over k is the same thing as r over kr, right?

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can cancel out the r's and get 1 over k plus--

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,070
and 1 over r is the same thing as k over kr.

71
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,000
So this statement is equivalent to this statement.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,030
So we're trying to figure out what r plus k over k times r is

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,010
Statement one just gives us the top.

74
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,030
So that by itself isn't enough.

75
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,010
What does statement two give us?

76
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,780
kr is equal to 64.

77
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,060
So statement two gives us this information, right?

78
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,030
Statement one gives us this information, up here.

79
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,700
So we actually need both of them to figure out

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,670
what this is equal to.

81
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,180
So the answer is C.

82
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,150
Both statements together are sufficient,

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
but individually they're not that useful.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,020
Problem 31.

85
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:47,020
If x is equal to one of the numbers, 1/4, 3/8, or 2/5,

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,000
what is the value of x?

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,070
So x is one of these,

88
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,010
and we have to figure out which of they are.

89
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:58,050
Ok, So statement one tells us that 1/4 is less than x,

90
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,010
which is less than 1/2.

91
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,440
So if x is greater than 1/4,

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,180
statement one immediately tells us that x is not 1/4.

93
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,640
And it also, Let's see. And x has to be less than 1/2.

94
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,700
Well both of these numbers are less than 1/2, right?

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,630
Statement one.

96
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,690
Let me do this in a color.

97
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,130
Statement one tells us that our answer is one of these two,

98
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,870
right?

99
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,020
That's what statement one tells us.

100
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,420
Because both of those--that's 0.4, that's less than 1/2.

101
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,020
3/8 is what?

102
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,960
Actually, no.

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,370
This is interesting. 3/8 is actually greater--

104
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,070
no, 3/8 is obviously less than 1/2, right?

105
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,000
What am I thinking. 4/8 is exactly 1/2.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,890
So 3/8 is also less than 1/2.

107
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,420
So statement one tells us it's one of those two choices.

108
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:52,130
And statement two says that 1/3 is less than x

109
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,000
which is less than 3/5.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,070
So this tells us that x has to be greater than 1/3.

111
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,250
So let's see. 3/8 is greater than 1/3, right?

112
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,030
Because 3/9 is 1/3.

113
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,040
So 3/8 is greater than 1/3.

114
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,000
2/5 is also greater than 1/3, right?

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,360
It's 0.4.

116
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,030
So that's greater than 1/3.

117
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:27,430
Let's see. 3/8, Is 3/8 less than 3/5?

118
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
Well, sure, right?

119
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,530
3/8 is definitely less than 3/5.

120
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,590
And 2/5 is definitely less than 3/5.

121
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,090
So it seems that statements two and one are actually

122
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,010
giving you the same information.

123
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,170
And when you get both of themŁŹthey actually don't clarify.

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,900
They don't give you any clarity, whether x is 3/8 or 2/5.

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,570
So they just leave you hanging.

126
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,030
And so the answer is E.

127
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,040
Together they're still not sufficient.

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,540
Unless I missed something.

129
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,800
Once again, remember, I'm just doing this in real time.

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,090
I don't know if-- it's very possible that I make an error.

131
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:11,020
Problem 32.

132
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:20,720
Triangle PQR. Let me draw that.Triangle PQR

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,070
If PQ is equal to x, so this distance is equal to x.

134
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,250
And QR is equal to x plus 2.

135
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,510
And PR is equal to y, which of the three angles of triangle

136
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,010
PQR has the greatest degree measure?

137
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,210
So they want to know which of these angles --so angle 1, 2, 3

138
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,360
You need to be able to figure out

139
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,000
which of these angles has the greatest degree measure.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,600
And it might be intuition to you.

141
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,210
But in order to figure out

142
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,930
which angle has the greatest degree measure,

143
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,490
you essentially have to figure out

144
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,710
which angle is opposite the largest side.

145
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,700
That's one way to think about it.

146
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,990
And that should get you which is the largest degree measure.

147
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,820
So if we could figure out whether x, x plus 2,

148
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,010
or y is larger, then we'd be all set.

149
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,510
So first of all, we know that x plus 2 is greater than x.

150
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,020
So our answer, as far as the longest side,

151
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,030
is either going to be y or x plus 2.

152
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,000
And the shortest side is either going to be y or x.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,090
But anyway. What do they say?

154
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,040
They, what information they say 1y is equal to x plus 3.

155
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,280
So if y is equal to x plus 3,

156
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,030
this is the largest side of the triangle, right?

157
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,010
This is the largest side of the triangle.

158
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:54,110
This is the second largest. And then this will be--

159
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,960
this will be, if I'm thinking about this? right,

160
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,080
this will be the largest angle.

161
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,030
Let me think about that.

162
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,040
I mean, you could go back to a little bit of our trigonometry

163
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,330
but right. this would be the largest angle.

164
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,400
And let's see.

165
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,080
So I think one alone is enough.

166
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,290
Because it tells us this is the longest side.

167
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,910
The triangle would look something like this.

168
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,070
This is the longest side.

169
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,410
This is the second longest side.

170
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,630
And then this would be the shortest side.

171
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,020
It would look something like that.

172
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,030
And then angle three would be the largest angle.

173
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,750
Let's see.

174
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,410
Statement number two tells us that x is equal to 2.

175
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,140
x is equal to 2 gives us no information about y.

176
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,070
If we say that x is equal to 2,

177
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,000
then we know that x plus 2 is equal to 4.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,940
And we have no information about y.

179
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,760
So that really still doesn't help us.

180
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,640
Because it could easily be a triangle like this.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,340
2,2 and then the 4 could come back this way and be like that

182
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,510
In which case this would be the largest angle.

183
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,000
Or y could be a really big distance.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,080
So that 4 could be like that, if y was a really large number.

185
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,340
Let's see.

186
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,330
If you have the combination of the two,

187
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,310
well-- we know that one alone is sufficient.

188
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,550
Two alone is not sufficient.

189
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,560
And I'm just doing-- let me think about it a little bit.

190
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,360
Let me make sure that I'm right, that one alone is sufficient

191
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,370
Yeah I'm pretty sure. I mean, I can't think of an example

192
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,000
where I have to know that x is equal to 2.

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah. So unless I'm wrong, the answer is a.

194
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,740
Statement one alone is sufficient.

195
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll see you in the next video.
