1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,150
All right

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,030
I re-read the question

3
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,390
and now I realize the error in my logic

4
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,210
I misread the question

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,510
I had misread it and I said, oh, there are 60 siblings

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,570
No, there are 60 sibling pairs

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,220
So that means in each class there-- so 60 siblings pairs

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,910
that means there are 120 siblings

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,030
But that tells us that in each class there aren't 30

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,610
there are 60 members of a sibling group, right?

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,330
So let's go back through our logic again

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,360
Let's say I pick someone from the junior class first

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,140
What is the probability that I even pick someone

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,500
from a sibling pair?

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,300
That's going to be 60/1,000,which is the same thing as 6/100

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,630
which is the same thing as 3/50, right?

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,830
Fair enough.

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,280
So there's a 3 in 50 chance that

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,470
I pick someone who's a member of a sibling pair

20
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,270
Now, in order for me to have a complete sibling pair

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,300
when I go to the senior class and pick someone

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,260
I have to pick this junior sibling

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,040
and that junior only has 1 sibling in the senior class

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,920
So there's only a 1 in 800 chance that I pick their sibling

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,860
It doesn't matter that--

26
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,710
the other 59 siblings in that are useless

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,090
because they're not this guy's sibling

28
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,840
So I have a 1 in 800 chance of doing that

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
You multiply them, you get 3/40,000

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,310
And that's choice A

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,010
If you don't see your choice

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,680
make sure to read the question again

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,770
Almost out of space so let me clear all of this

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,960
Let me clear all of that

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,980
And we're on problem 218

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,470
Which of the following cannot be the median of the three

37
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,440
positive integers x, y, and z?

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,250
So the median, the middle number

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,620
They say A is x

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,380
Well, no, that's not true

41
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,520
What if this was the order? x y, z

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,740
then x would be the median

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,970
So it's not A

44
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,070
B, z

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,770
No reason why z can't be the median

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,900
The order can be y, z, x

47
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,980
It's not B

48
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:08,820
C, x plus z

49
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,990
Well, let's see, could x plus z be the median?

50
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,620
x plus z, could that be the median?

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,850
Let me think about it

52
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:30,380
If we have x, z, and y, I mean

53
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,470
by definition one of these numbers has to be the median

54
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,550
We have three numbers

55
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,110
one of them has to be the middle number

56
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,270
Under what circumstances-- because x plus--

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,650
I mean, if x plus z is the median

58
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,430
that implies that neither x nor z is the median, right?

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,020
Do they tell us that those are-- right

60
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,820
they're positive integers

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,440
None of these are zero

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
So in order for x plus z to be the median

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,440
that tells us that neither x nor z is the median, right?

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,870
And if neither x nor z is the median

65
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,660
then y has to be the median

66
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,610
And then that tells us that x plus z has to be equal to y

67
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,340
But if y is the median, the order is this: x, y, z

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,740
And there's no way that I can add x and z and get a smaller

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,630
number than z

70
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,530
because all of these numbers are positive, right?

71
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,230
Yeah, they said three positive integers

72
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,550
So I go with choice C

73
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,650
That cannot happen

74
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,240
The median cannot be x plus z

75
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,660
Problem 219

76
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,590
What is the 25th digit to the right of the decimal point

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,070
in the decimal form of 6/11?

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,440
And whenever they ask you for something ridiculous

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,710
there must be some type of pattern we can exploit to

80
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,520
figure out what the 25th digit is

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,780
Let's just start dividing

82
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,480
11 goes into 6

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,550
so we're going to have to have some decimals there

84
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,010
11 goes into 60 five times

85
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,790
5 times 11 is 55, and remainder 5

86
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,120
And you're going to 50, you get a 4

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,030
4 times-- I already see the pattern-- 44

88
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,180
Oh no, never mind

89
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,440
Wait, let me make sure that's right

90
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,500
55, you get 50 remainder, 11 goes into 50 four times

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,270
You get 40

92
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,470
So then you get 60

93
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,080
11 goes into 60 five times

94
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,430
and you repeat so on and so forth

95
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,690
I just want to make sure

96
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,120
Let's see, the first digit to the right is 25

97
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,050
The second digit to the right is 4

98
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,740
The third digit to the right is 5

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,370
And so, you know, we could keep going

100
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,000
The fourth digit to the right is 4

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,430
So every odd digit to the right of this is what?

102
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,610
It's 5

103
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,630
So they want to know the 25th digit to the right

104
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,230
and that's an odd number, 25

105
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,100
So it has to be 5 as well

106
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,260
So that's choice C

107
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:54,990
Next question

108
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,640
Oh, I thought I had to erase that

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,700
OK, question 220

110
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,870
John and Mary were each paid x dollars in advance

111
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,400
to do a certain job together

112
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,650
Fair enough

113
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,980
John worked on the job for 10 hours,so John worked 10 hours

114
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,730
and Mary worked 2 hours less than John

115
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,640
So Mary worked 8 hours, right?

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,990
John worked on the job for 10 hours

117
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,310
and Mary worked for 2 hours less than John

118
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,010
so she worked 8 hours

119
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,580
If Mary gave y dollars of her payment

120
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,410
so that they would have received the same hourly wage

121
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,220
what was the dollar

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,060
amount in terms of y that John was paid in advance?

123
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,690
OK, John and Mary were each paid x dollars in advance to

124
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,470
do a certain job together

125
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,720
OK, so how much money did they-- so John got x dollars

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,570
and Mary got x dollars

127
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,210
They both got x dollars, right?

128
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,150
So if you think about it

129
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,760
let's ignore who did what, right?

130
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,500
We had how many total hours of labor?

131
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,460
We had 18 hours of labor

132
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,540
and they were paid how many dollars?

133
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:18,510
They were paid 2x dollars for 18 hours of labor

134
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,070
So the average wage should be--

135
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,150
you could kind of do it the fair--

136
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,970
you know, per hourly 0wage should be--

137
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,410
let's see, we could divide by 9,you get a 1 and you get a 9

138
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:47,290
You get x/9 dollars per hour

139
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,200
That's the fair way

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,060
So let me re-read the question

141
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,400
If Mary gave John y dollars of her payment

142
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,320
so that they would have had the same hourly wage

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,500
what was the dollar amount

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,250
in terms of y that John was paid in advance?

145
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,470
Actually, let's think of it this way

146
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,330
So Mary pays John-- let me ignore this

147
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,450
I just thought of a better way of doing it

148
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,220
So they were each paid x hours in advance to do a certain job

149
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,910
John worked on the job for 10 hours

150
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,930
and Mary worked 2 hours less than John

151
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,040
If Mary paid John y dollars of her payment

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,550
so that they would have received the same hourly wage--

153
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,000
so after Mary pays John y

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,430
what-- so that means John got a total of y dollars

155
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,880
and Mary has paid y dollars

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,290
So now John has x plus y, and Mary has x minus y dollars

157
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,460
And so, if Mary paid of her payment

158
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,390
so that they would receive the same hourly wage

159
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,950
what was the dollar amount

160
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:48,730
in terms of y that John was paid in advance?

161
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,100
So let me think about this a little bit

162
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,810
So they got the same-- they received the same hourly wage

163
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:03,670
So Mary should have 8/10 the money of John, right?

164
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:13,450
So x minus y should be equal to 0.8 times x plus y

165
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,390
Am I thinking about that right

166
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,180
or is there an easier way to think about it?

167
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,950
Well, let's think about it this way

168
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,340
John worked 2 hours more than Mary, right?

169
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:31,680
So Mary, essentially, if she pays him for 1 hour-- no

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,720
yeah, this is the right thing. x minus y is equal to 0.8

171
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,300
times x plus y, but I'm going to still end up with an x here

172
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:49,360
So you get x minus y is equal to 0.8x plus 0.8y, right?

173
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,880
And all the logic here I just said is--

174
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,640
well, Mary's total money

175
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,950
if we're going to be fair

176
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,180
should be 0.8 of John's total money

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,820
because she worked 0.8 as much hours

178
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,290
And so, let's see

179
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, actually,they want to know what John was paid in advance

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,640
so that's x

181
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,190
So actually, OK, we're fine

182
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,020
So they just want to know what x is in terms of y

183
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,910
So we're cool

184
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,550
So let's subtract 0.8x from both sides

185
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,470
So you get 0.2x minus y is equal to 0.8y

186
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,540
And then add y to both sides

187
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,170
You get 0.2x is equal to 1.8y

188
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,410
And then multiply both sides by 5

189
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,350
you get x is equal to-- what is that?

190
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,290
5 times 18 is 50 plus 40

191
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,540
Add a decimal point is 90 is equal to 9y

192
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,350
And that is choice E

193
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,760
I got a little confused with the wording of it

194
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,320
when they say what was the dollar amount in terms of y

195
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,700
that John was paid in advance?

196
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,900
They should've said what was x?

197
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
And that would've been a little bit easier

198
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,580
Anyway, I'm all out of time

199
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,710
Sorry for bumbling through that problem

200
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,020
See you in the next video
