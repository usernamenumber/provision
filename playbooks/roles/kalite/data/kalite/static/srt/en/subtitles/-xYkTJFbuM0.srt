1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,540
   

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,500
So we had the hundred
logicians.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,570
All of their foreheads
were painted blue.

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,910
And before they entered the
room, they were told that at

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,240
least one of you hundred
logicians has your forehead

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,440
painted blue.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,920
And then every time that they
turned on the lights, so that

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,420
they could see each other,
they said OK, once you've

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,820
determined that you have a blue
forehead, when the lights

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,040
get turned off again, we want
you to leave the room.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,120
And then once that's kind of
settled down, they'll turn the

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,270
lights on again.

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,659
And people will look at
each other again.

14
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,820
And then they'll turn
them off again.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,970
And maybe people will
leave the room.

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,150
And so forth and so on.

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,810
And they're also all told that
everyone in the room is a

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,700
perfect logician.

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,380
They have infallible logic.

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,560
So the question was,
what happens?

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,990
And actually maybe an even more
interesting question is

22
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,420
why does it happen?

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,880
So I'll answer the first,
what happens?

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,050
And if just take the answer,
and you don't know why, it

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,880
almost seems mystical.

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,520
That essentially the light gets
turned on and off 100

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,640
times, and then after the
hundredth time that the light

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,540
gets turned on, and the lights
get turned off again, all of

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,350
them leave. They all leave.
So I mean, it's

30
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,730
kind of weird, right?

31
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,660
Let's say I'm one of them.

32
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,750
Or you're one of them.

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,060
I go into this room.

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,570
The lights get turned on.

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,090
And I see 99 people with
blue foreheads.

36
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,020
And I can't see my
own forehead.

37
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,520
They see my forehead,
of course.

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,810
But to any other person, I'm
one of the 99, right?

39
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,690
But I see 99 blue foreheads.

40
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,970
So essentially what happens if
we were to watch the show is,

41
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,390
the lights get turned on.

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,150
You see 99 blue foreheads.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,910
Then the lights get
turned off again.

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,970
And then the lights get
turned on again.

45
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,030
And everyone's still
sitting there.

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,700
And I still see 99
blue foreheads.

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,490
And that happens 100 times.

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,510
And after the hundredth time
the light gets turned on,

49
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,810
everyone leaves the room.

50
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,230
And at first glance,
that seems crazy,

51
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,210
because nothing changes.

52
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:21,010
Nothing changes between every
time we turn on the light.

53
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,030
But the way you need to think
about this-- and this is what

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,380
makes it interesting-- is what
happens instead of 100, let's

55
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,070
say there was one person
in the room.

56
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,485
So before the show starts-- they
never told me that there

57
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,890
were going to be 100
people in the room.

58
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,010
They just said, at least one
of you, at least one of the

59
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,310
people in the room, has your
forehead painted blue.

60
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,410
And as soon as you know that
your forehead is painted blue,

61
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,920
you leave the room.

62
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,950
And that everyone's a
perfect logician.

63
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,430
So imagine the situation where
instead of 100 there's only

64
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,500
one perfect logician.

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Let's say it's me.

66
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,570
So that's the room.

67
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,460
I walk in.

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,760
And I sit down.

69
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,160
And maybe I should
do it with blue.

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,540
And then they turn the
lights on, and say,

71
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,310
look around the room.

72
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,890
And I look around the room, and
I see nobody else, right?

73
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,525
And remember, even in the case
of one, we've painted

74
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:12,540
everyone's forehead blue.

75
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,360
So in this case, this one dude,
or me or whoever you

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,270
want to call him.

77
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,110
His forehead is painted blue.

78
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,970
So he looks around and he
sees no one in the room.

79
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,880
But he remembers the statement,
and maybe it's even

80
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,830
written down on a card for
him in case he forgets.

81
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,310
That at least one of you has
your forehead painted blue.

82
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,180
So if he looks around the room
and he says, well I'm the only

83
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,850
dude in the room.

84
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,470
And they told me that at least
one of the dudes in the room

85
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,110
is going to have their
foreheads blue.

86
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,870
Well, I'm the only
dude in the room.

87
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,620
So I must have a
blue forehead.

88
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,550
So as soon as they turn the
lights off, he's going to

89
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,450
leave. Fair enough.

90
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,010
That's almost trivially
simple.

91
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,040
And you might say, so how
does this apply to 100?

92
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,820
Well what happens when
there are two people.

93
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,870
And once again, both
of them have their

94
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,810
foreheads painted blue.

95
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,480
So let me draw another.

96
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,060
I don't want to keep drawing
the blue forehead room.

97
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,130
Let's say there's
two people now.

98
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,400
So let's put ourselves in
the head of this guy.

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,650
Right behind the
blue forehead.

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,270
That's where we're sitting.

101
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,620
OK.

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,660
So when he enters the room.

103
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,380
He says, I either have
a blue forehead.

104
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,712
   

105
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:31,010
I either have a blue
forehead, or I

106
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,220
don't have a blue forehead.

107
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,490
No blue.

108
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,180
Right?

109
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,230
This is what this
guy's thinking.

110
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,050
Let me draw him.

111
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,900
And he has a blue forehead.

112
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,590
But he doesn't know it.

113
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,180
He can't see it.

114
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,050
That's the whole point about
painting the forehead blue, as

115
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,170
opposed to another
part of the body.

116
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,890
So he says, I either have a blue
forehead or I don't have

117
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,440
a blue forehead.

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,800
He walks in.

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,950
Let's say this is this guy.

120
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,850
He walks in.

121
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,930
The first time the lights get
turned on, he sees this other

122
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,410
dude there who has
a blue forehead.

123
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,480
And he says OK, now let
me think about it.

124
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,900
How will this guy respond
depending on

125
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,220
each of these states?

126
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,070
So let's say that I don't
have a blue forehead.

127
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,730
Let's go into this reality.

128
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,900
If I don't have a blue forehead,
what is this guy

129
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,180
going to see?

130
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,620
When the lights get turned on,
he's going to see that I don't

131
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,760
have a blue forehead.

132
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,770
And we were both told
that at least one of

133
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,440
us has a blue forehead.

134
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,070
So this guy, because he's a
perfect logician, will deduce

135
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,690
that he has to have
a blue forehead.

136
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,630
Remember, this is in a
situation, if I assume that I

137
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,720
don't have a blue forehead.

138
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,700
We're in this world.

139
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,920
I'm a perfect logician, so
if I can assume, if I'm

140
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,690
simulating the reality where I
don't have a blue forehead,

141
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,550
then this guy will see, I don't
have a blue forehead.

142
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,950
And then he'll say, I must
have a blue forehead.

143
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,260
And so when the lights get
turned off, this guy will

144
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,950
leave. He'll exit the room.

145
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,680
And vice versa.

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,770
The other guy will make
the same logic.

147
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,940
But since both of them have blue
foreheads, what happens?

148
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,680
The lights get turned
off, then the lights

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,020
get turned back on.

150
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,270
When the light gets turned
back on, this guy's still

151
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,490
sitting here.

152
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,780
And I just determined that
if I didn't have a blue

153
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,790
forehead-- and this is me--
this guy would have left.

154
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,920
Because he could've said, oh I
must be the only guy with a

155
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
blue forehead.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,710
So he would have left.

157
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,630
But since he didn't leave,
I now know that

158
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,300
I have a blue forehead.

159
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,420
So then the second time that
the lights get turned on, I

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,030
can deduce that I have
a blue forehead.

161
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,500
And then when the lights get
turned off again, I'll leave.

162
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,950
And this guy, he's a perfect
logician, so he makes the

163
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,460
exact same conclusion.

164
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,420
Because he also simulated in his
head, OK if I didn't have

165
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:59,790
a blue forehead, then this guy
will leave as soon as the

166
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,330
lights get turned off
the first time.

167
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,140
If this guy doesn't have a blue
forehead, then this guy

168
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,390
will say, well I see no-one else
in the room with a blue

169
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,870
forehead, and since I know that
there's at least one with

170
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,990
a blue forehead, I'll have to
leave. But since he didn't

171
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,200
leave, this guy will also know
that he must have a blue

172
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
forehead as well, so they'll
actually leave together.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,250
Maybe they'll bump into each
other on the way out.

174
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,520
Fair enough.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,390
Now what happens if you extend
it to three people?

176
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,570
So we already said, if you have
one person in the room,

177
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,060
he'll come to the conclusion the
first time that the lights

178
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,650
are turned on.

179
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,390
And then he'll leave right
when they're turned off.

180
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,780
If you have two people, it takes
them essentially two

181
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,860
times for the light to get
turned on to reach that

182
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,020
conclusion.

183
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,990
Now if you have three people,
and I think you see

184
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,240
where this is going.

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,420
   

186
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,240
One, two and three.

187
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,780
Now remember, no one knows if
their foreheads are painted

188
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,430
blue, but the producers of the
show actually did paint

189
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,340
everyone's forehead blue.

190
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,090
So so once again, let's get
into this guy's head.

191
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,120
So this guy says, he's either
blue or he's not blue.

192
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,990
   

193
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,810
So in the reality when
he's not blue,

194
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,840
what's going to happen?

195
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,820
Well, this guy-- and this gets a
little bit confusing, but if

196
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,790
you think about it from the
previous example, it makes a

197
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,040
lot of sense.

198
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,250
   

199
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,690
A person who has a not-blue
forehead actually shouldn't

200
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,730
affect the outcome of what
the blue people do.

201
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,340
Because let's say that this guy
says, well what's going to

202
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,700
happen if I'm not blue?

203
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,020
Well, this guy's going to look
at that guy, and say, oh he

204
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,720
has a blue forehead.

205
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,820
He doesn't have a
blue forehead.

206
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,050
So if I don't have a blue
forehead, this guy's going to

207
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,360
see two people without
blue foreheads.

208
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:04,760
And he's going to leave the room
the first time that the

209
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,650
lights are turned on.

210
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,670
He'll come to the conclusion.

211
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,080
Now the second time that the
light's turned on, this guy

212
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,550
will say, gee, this guy
didn't leave the room.

213
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,250
That guy doesn't have
a blue forehead.

214
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,500
And this guy didn't leave the
room because he must have seen

215
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,150
someone with a blue forehead.

216
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,540
Therefore I must have
a blue forehead.

217
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,810
And so, if this guy doesn't have
a blue forehead, both of

218
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,990
these guys would leave the room
the second time that the

219
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,580
light gets turned on.

220
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,050
Now what happens if they don't
leave the room the second time

221
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,800
that the lights are turned on?

222
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,000
Well if I was not blue,
they would have left.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,430
So if they haven't left by the
third showing of the light,

224
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,660
then I know that I'm blue.

225
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,270
So when you have three people,
they're all perfect logicians,

226
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,810
they all have their foreheads
painted blue.

227
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,860
The light will be shown
three times.

228
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,950
Or the light will be turned
on three times.

229
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,800
And then when the light
gets turned off,

230
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,050
they'll all leave together.

231
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,970
   

232
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,760
And so this logic
applies for any.

233
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,230
You could have 1,000 people.

234
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,250
You can keep extending it.

235
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,030
The fourth person will have
the exact same logic.

236
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:16,450
If he's not blue, then these
guys are going to leave after

237
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,430
three turnings on
of the light.

238
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,670
But if they don't leave after
three turnings on of the

239
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,030
light, then he must be blue.

240
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,630
And so they're all going
to leave together.

241
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,390
All four of them on
the fourth showing

242
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,340
of everyone's foreheads.

243
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,860
Anyway, and you can keep
extending this

244
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,640
all the way to 100.

245
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,625
And 100 is arbitrary.

246
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,520
You could do this with a million
people, and they would

247
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,060
just keep looking at each
other a million times.

248
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,020
And then on the millionth
showing, they would all reach

249
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,236
the conclusion that they all
have blue foreheads, and they

250
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:44,880
would leave the room.

251
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,170
And if you think about
it, it's fairly

252
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,100
straightforward logic.

253
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:56,230
But it leads to kind of a very
almost eerie result.

254
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,700
Hopefully that satisfies you.

255
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,540
See you in the next video.

256
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,027
