1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,300
We're on problem 49.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,980
Let me copy and paste
it into the window.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,080
I've copied it and now
let me paste it.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,110
There you go, problem 49.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,915
Let me pick a good highlighter
color, magenta is good.

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:22,190
A student showed the following
steps in his solution to the

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,810
equation below, but his answer
was not correct.

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,070
Then at the bottom they say, in
which step did he make his

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,910
first error?

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,410
So let's see, log base 5 of 2x
squared, minus 3x, plus 1,

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,180
minus log base 5 of x, minus 1,
plus log base 5 of 125 is

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,830
equal to 6.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,570
Fair enough.

15
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,180
All right, now it looks like
in this first step, he kept

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,910
this the same.

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,640
You can't mess up there.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,490
Then he said log base
5 of 125 is 3.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,110
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,900
5 to the third power
is equal to 125.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,300
So that is right as well.

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,630
Let's see, here it looks like he
took the 2x squared, minus

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,640
3x plus 1, and he factored
them into 2x minus

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,430
1 and x minus 1.

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,520
Let's see if that's right.

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,980
2x times 2x is 2x squared.

27
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,540
2x times minus 1 is minus 2x.

28
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,406
Minus 1 times x is minus 3x.

29
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:21,870
And you have a minus 1 times a
minus 1, you get a plus 1.

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,080
So you get 2x squared,
minus x, minus 2x, so

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,310
minus 3x, plus 1.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,470
So this is right.

33
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,680
So so far so good.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,390
What does he do next?

35
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,880
All right, in the next
step he keeps this

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,070
first term the same.

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,680
2x minus 1, x minus 1.

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,140
Fair enough.

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,490
He keeps this term the same.

40
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,720
He just subtracts 3
from both sides.

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,550
He subtracts 3 from both sides
and this becomes 0 and then

42
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,770
this becomes 3.

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,030
Fair enough.

44
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,690
What does he do in
the next step?

45
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,940
This is interesting.

46
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,370
   

47
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,720
He essentially said, if I am
subtracting 2 logarithms with

48
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,280
the same base, that's
the equivalent of

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,479
dividing the two things.

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,010
So he kind of did a
quick step here.

51
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,170
So his logic here is that log--
I don't even have to

52
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,190
write the base 5-- but log of
2x, minus 1, times x minus 1,

53
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:30,490
minus log of base 5, times x
minus 1, that that would be

54
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:40,450
equal log of 2x minus 1, times
x minus 1, all of that

55
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,780
over x minus 1.

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,490
   

57
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,840
That seems fair enough.

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,660
So that should cancel out.

59
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,460
Oh, but that's where he
made his mistake.

60
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,190
What you end up with left over
when you cancel out the 2x

61
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,330
minus 1's, isn't one
of the minus 1's.

62
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,500
You're left with log
of 2x minus 1.

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,750
This x minus 1 and this
x minus 1 cancel out.

64
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,710
He should be left
with just the 2x

65
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,900
minus 1 in the logarithm.

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,190
But instead, somehow he got
rid of the 2x minus 1 and

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,340
ended up with just an
x minus 1 here.

68
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,115
So step 3 is where he made
his first mistake.

69
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:25,630
   

70
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,010
I don't know.

71
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,910
He somehow intuitively knew that
you could divide x minus

72
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,390
1 into this, because of log of
A minus log of B is equal to

73
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,960
log of A over B.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,900
But I don't know, he simplified
wrong or something.

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,930
Who knows?

76
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,180
Next problem.

77
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,950
   

78
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,850
All right, let me copy and
paste this one too.

79
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,430
I'm starting to like this notion
of copying and pasting.

80
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,790
I don't have to rewrite
the problem.

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,660
And I can mark it up and do all
sorts of things with it.

82
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,690
All right, a certain radioactive
element decays

83
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,000
over time, according to the
equation y is equal to A times

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,870
1/2 to the t divided
by 300th power.

85
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,600
Where A equals the number of
grams present initially, t

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,829
equals time in years.

87
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,980
If 1,000 grams were present
initially, how many grams will

88
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,740
remain after 900 years?

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,220
So we get y is equal to--
1,000 grams were present

90
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,920
initially, so that's A.

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,640
So 1,000 times 1/2 to the-- and
they say, what is time?

92
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,340
How many grams will remain
after 900 years?

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,120
t is time in years.

94
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,420
So 1/2 to the 900
divided by 300.

95
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,120
I just substituted
A and t into the

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,300
equations they gave us.

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,340
1,000 is A, and 900 is t.

98
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,780
So let's just simplify
this thing.

99
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:05,920
So we get this is equal to
1,000 times 1/2 to the--

100
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,490
what's 900 divided by 300?

101
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,740
It's just 3.

102
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
So that equals 1,000.

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,090
What's 1/2 to the third power?

104
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,261
It's 1/8.

105
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:18,000
It's 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,590
So we get 1,000 divided
by 8, which is 125.

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,990
125 grams are left
in 900 years.

108
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,360
That is choice C.

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
Next problem.

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,030
All right, let me see
if I have to copy

111
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,590
and paste this one.

112
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,520
Yeah, sure, they have a
chart, even better.

113
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
   

114
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,700
I've copied it, and
there we go.

115
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,410
Look at that.

116
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,620
All right.

117
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,920
Bacteria in a culture are
growing exponentially with

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,420
time as shown in the
table below.

119
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,090
Which of the following equations
expresses the number

120
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,090
of bacteria y present
at any time t.

121
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,510
OK, so growing exponentially
tells us that if I say, the

122
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,910
amount of bacteria after any
days, so let's say y would be

123
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,050
the amount of bacteria,
exponential form tends to be

124
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,530
you'd have your initial amount--
like A in that

125
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,770
previous example-- times some
number that is kind of the

126
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,960
exponent factor, I guess
you could call it.

127
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
The last one it was 1/2.

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,580
When you do continuous compound
interest, it'll be e.

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,570
It'll be how fast something is
either growing or decaying.

130
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,720
I don't know, that'll be x.

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,310
I'm just making up a letter.

132
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,760
It's usually x to some power t
that's usually a function of

133
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,740
time, some constant
times time.

134
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,230
This is the general form
of any kind of

135
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,190
exponential growth or decay.

136
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,800
You might see different letters
than that, but that's

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,730
the general idea.

138
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,310
So anyway, if we look at all of
these choices, well, if you

139
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,800
just look at the thing,
you're seeing it's

140
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,840
doubling every day.

141
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
The amount of bacteria is
doubling every day.

142
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,680
So that tells us that's going
to be some power of 2.

143
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,460
So y is going to be-- the amount
of bacteria after any

144
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,980
day is going to be equal
to some initial amount.

145
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,760
Actually, we could just
think about it, right?

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,680
We have some initial amount
times 2 to some constant times

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,450
the day's power.

148
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,640
But I think if we just
take 2 to the day's

149
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,920
power-- let's see.

150
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,520
At 0 days you have
a 100 bacteria.

151
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,950
So y is equal to 100-- I think
this gets you there; and

152
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,970
instead of writing days,
let's write time--

153
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,110
times 2 to the time.

154
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,370
Sometimes there's a constant
here, but this is

155
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,560
straightforward enough.

156
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,650
When t is equal to 0, this 2
to the t becomes 1, and you

157
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,010
have 100 here.

158
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,750
When t is 1, then
this becomes 2.

159
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,920
2 times 100 is 200.

160
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,390
You could say this is
t and this is y.

161
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,080
When t is 0, y is 100.

162
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
When t is 1, y is 200.

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,210
When t is 2, y is 400.

164
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,210
So it is choice B.

165
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,550
Probably the easiest way is
just to look at these.

166
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,560
And say, wow, there's only
one-- well, two of these

167
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,460
choices, well, three of
them have kind of

168
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,335
an exponential form.

169
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,310
We're just like, oh, well, this
doesn't take into account

170
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,710
the initial condition.

171
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,530
At day 0 I have 100 bacteria.

172
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,790
This one, I don't know, it
says at day 0, I have 200

173
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,720
bacteria, which is just wrong.

174
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,660
I have 100.

175
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,630
You take t equals 0, and
you're left with what

176
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,179
you have at day 0.

177
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,520
So depending on how you
look at it, you

178
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,820
get to B either way.

179
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,919
Next question.

180
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,539
I'm running out of space.

181
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,130
Oh, there you go.

182
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,830
All right, next question.

183
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,700
They write, I'll write
the whole thing here.

184
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,470
   

185
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,160
If the equation y to the 2x
is graphed, which of the

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,920
following values of x would
produce a point

187
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,730
closest to the x-axis?

188
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,880
So if you think about it, let's
just think about how

189
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,590
that graph would even look.

190
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,610
Let me draw it here actually.

191
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,390
I'll draw it in a
darker color.

192
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,230
I can do it right on
top of the white.

193
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,730
   

194
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,810
Let's just get an intuition.

195
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,380
What's 2 to the 0?

196
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,140
2 to the 0 is 1, right?

197
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,060
Its y-intercept would
be 1 at x equals 0.

198
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,995
2 squared, then 2
to the 2 power.

199
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:41,565
And you were looking at
4, we'll go there.

200
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:45,510
   

201
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:53,500
Sorry, let's say if this is 1,
this would be 2, 2 to the

202
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,990
first power.

203
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,920
Then 2 to the second
power would be 4.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,970
Then 2 to the third
power would be 8.

205
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,440
Actually, 4 would be like.

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,700
So it's going to look
something like that.

207
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,250
We don't have to worry.

208
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,310
It's going to go
up really fast.

209
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,100
Now what happens as you go
into the negative powers?

210
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,180
So 2 to the negative
1 power is 1/2.

211
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,240
You're going to get
right there.

212
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,740
2 to the negative 2 is 1/4.

213
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,090
So you're just going to get
smaller and it's just going to

214
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,930
asymptote to 0.

215
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,320
So that's what the graph
is going to look like.

216
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,230
I didn't even have to worry
about negatives, because there

217
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,480
are no negative numbers here.

218
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,390
So really, the smallest of these
are going to produce a

219
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,750
point closest to the x-axis.

220
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,090
The smallest of these
values, you want to

221
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,100
get as small as possible.

222
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,490
Let's see, 3/4 is
bigger than 1/4.

223
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,540
So that's not right.

224
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,720
5/3 is bigger than 1/4.

225
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,380
8/3 is bigger than 1/4.

226
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,740
So the answer is 1/4, A.

227
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,780
2 to the 1/4 power is going to
be a little bit more than 1.

228
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,850
It's going to be something
like that.

229
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,310
Anyway, next question.

230
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,370
Oh, I'm all out of time.

231
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,210
See you in the next video.

232
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,500
