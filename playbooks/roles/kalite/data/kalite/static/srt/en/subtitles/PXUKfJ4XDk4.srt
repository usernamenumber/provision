00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:08,015
Monica and Brian here in the Upper Egypt Galleries of the University

2
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:11,664
Of Pennsylvania, Museum of Archeology and Anthropology.

3
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:17,680
And we're looking here at a larger than life sculpture of Ramses II

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,348
who was a pharaoh in the New Kingdom of Ancient Egypt.

5
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:23,957
Right in the center of the gallery it really dominates the space

6
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,073
and seems to draw everybody in to its universe.

7
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:30,081
Absolutely, and that's really what its function is.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,779
Really everything about this sculpture is about showing power

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,051
and we'll talk a little bit about that today,

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,707
about how that works.

11
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:42,135
This would be a representation of a kind

12
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:44,712
that you would find in all different shapes and sizes, is that right?

13
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:47,375
I don't know about shapes, but certainly sizes

14
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:50,089
from life-size to larger than life size

15
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,660
to colossal, 20 feet and more tall.

16
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,313
So where would this one fit in a sense of scale values?

17
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:02,229
I think (...) there are other depictions of Ramses

18
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:08,885
for instance there are colossal representations of Ramses at his large temple in Abu Simbel in Upper Egypt.

19
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:14,358
And so speaking of temples, that's where this sculpture like this, and

20
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:18,661
in fact this very sculpture was placed in a temple dedicated to Ramses.

21
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:24,203
Ok, so in terms of function, this is not a display of power for the people.

22
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:27,907
No, because really common people wouldn't even be allowed into

23
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,041
the innermost chambers of the temple.

24
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:34,264
The priests would come and they would bring offerings to the representation of a pharaoh

25
00:01:34,264 --> 00:01:40,520
in fact there's even a little dip in the sculpture itself in front of his feet as you can see right here,

26
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:44,998
and that's where some of those offerings would have been placed by the priests.

27
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,201
That's fascinating because you don't often think of these as functional sculptures.

28
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,271
You think of them as being, you know, kind of something to be revered.

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,460
That's right. It sort of has a dual in that sense.

30
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,208
I mean, although we can't deny clearly the very overt displays of power

31
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:03,572
and conventional displays of power that this sculpture shows.

32
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:09,137
For instance, things that we would expect to see in any representation of a great pharaoh:

33
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:15,403
the linen head cloth, the snake Uraeus there at the top of his forehead,

34
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:18,381
what's missing now, the inset false beard,

35
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,952
that's also conventional show of pharaonic power.

36
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:27,210
And all this on top of an idealized body, right, so a heroic body type particular to the pharaoh.

37
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:32,912
That's right, so besides just the trappings of power,

38
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:41,342
the trapping of imperial power, we also have a kind of convention of showing the body type in a powerful way.

39
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:48,847
The musculature, the hands placed firmly and flatly on the thighs as well.

40
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,633
And this particular piece has some challenges to it.

41
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:55,872
In addition to being pretty badly beaten up.

42
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,262
Yes, it's clearly been damaged, broken into parts over time and reassembled,

43
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:05,078
but you might notice something a little strange about his head.

44
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:10,169
Yeah, it's a little tiny and when you come into the gallery you see this remarkable presence

45
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:14,212
and as you get closer to it, you can't help but feel that the head is a little bit too small.

46
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,381
Why is his head too small, right.

47
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,317
And the reason for that is that it's believed actually

48
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:20,916
because of the style of the lower part of the body,

49
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,626
that this sculpture was originally from the Middle Kingdom,

50
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:29,940
that it actually was not at first meant to be a representation of Ramses.

51
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:32,134
Okay. So, it's repurposed.

52
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:38,390
Exactly, later when he came to power then the head was resculptured to create a likeness of Ramses.

53
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,963
And so of course by the subtractive method that would make the head a bit smaller.

54
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:48,666
Wow, so the same head of the previous pharaoh, I guess by logical extension, a less powerful pharaoh,

55
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,291
That's right, or someone who was succeeded by Ramses.

56
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,062
And he's whittled down to look like Ramses.

57
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:55,003
That's remarkable. Exactly, right.

58
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,604
It's pretty beat up, it's pretty broken.

59
00:03:56,604 --> 00:04:03,441
Yes, it sustained some heavy damage, and the waist is cut clean through, the neck as well.

60
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:08,562
So, that fact that it's quartzite I'm guessing that's not as hard of a stone as we're used to seeing.

61
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:13,771
Right, a diorite is really the preferred hard stone in Ancient Egyptian sculpture,

62
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:17,456
but actually, one of the advantages of the quartzite in this case

63
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:21,106
is that because it's more porous, it retains some of the original pigment.

64
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,676
I think important to remember, and it's very easy to forget

65
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:28,396
that all of this ancient sculpture would have been painted,

66
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:32,819
stones such as diorite which is so hard and so dense,

67
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,644
that paint has flaked off over the thousands of years since it was painted.

68
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,459
But with more porous stones you can see that they retained some of the pigment.

69
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,319
We have some kind of reddish tone to the skin and that's also an Egyptian convention,

70
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,408
to show male figures with a kind of reddish skin tone.

71
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:52,614
And we can also see the stripes that had been painted in the linen head cloth as well.

72
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:55,807
Marvellous. I did not notice the color before you just pointed that out.

73
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:58,672
Now I can kind of see the yellow and blue, is it? Or the black and yellow.

74
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,562
It's probably the yellow and blue.

75
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:05,259
If you think about a King Tut's, cover of the coffin, it's yellow and blue, right.

76
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,261
The gold and the lapis, I think.

77
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,644
You've changed the way I look at this sculpture now. That's remarkable.

78
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,999
So the compactness of the forms would be the body, the arms close to the body

79
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,730
and the stone between the torso and the arm is still there.

80
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,878
Absolutely right, his arm's not sculpted free from the body,

81
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:25,691
it all perhaps just a in little bit that's broken away and that's in fact of course why it's broken away.

82
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:31,125
Right, so his forearms are missing, but you can see the hands resting comfortably on the lap

83
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:34,403
which would suggest no projecting parts, right, nothing to break off.

84
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:35,517
Exactly.

85
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:42,190
So the body type we mentioned is a heroic body type which we would expect to see of a pharaoh,

86
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:47,401
but it, well is it similar or different than we're used to seeing in Greco-Roman art,

87
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:51,136
in terms of, say, naturalism, in terms of a natural body?

88
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,137
I think it's really quite different, don't you?

89
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:56,844
I mean, we have this very strong and muscular body type,

90
00:05:56,844 --> 00:06:02,477
but does it look really the way human body looks in all of its naturalism?

91
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:04,249
I think at first glances people think so.

92
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:07,116
I think they do, but if we look closely,

93
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:10,229
the way the upper arm connects to the shoulders,

94
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,279
somewhat awkward this very thick shins

95
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,493
with their big muscles and this sharp ridge of a shinbone.

96
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,452
So a body type that's particular to the pharaoh

97
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:26,476
you can imagine if we had all the pharaohs lined up we would see a consistency in there.

98
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,334
That's right. Where really the most important thing is showing

99
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:34,245
how strong and immovable and permanent the power of this pharaoh is

100
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:37,624
rather than showing the way his shins and his toes actually looked.

101
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,671
Right. But a consistency of the way he's represented,

102
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,745
so it's always recognized that's a pharaoh.

103
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:50,467
So that, together with the trappings of his power, really, those things work together to show that.

104
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:56,529
So the permanence that we talked about before of the stone keeping the forms compact,

105
00:06:56,852 --> 00:07:00,804
would work especially in the context of the tomb to keep things ...

106
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,082
Yes, absolutely because that ties in perfectly with the Egyptian belief in the afterlife,

107
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:12,659
in this kind of eternal presence or existence of the Ka or the soul of the deceased.

108
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:13,770
The long now.

109
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,877
That's right.

110
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:23,101
And the recognizable features work in a political (...) for people to recognize this particular pharaoh,

111
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,914
but then also work in a tomb, so the Ka can recognize the pharaoh.

112
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,954
That's right, because the Ka goes off and wanders around to the underworld, here and there,

113
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:33,346
but it always needs to come back and needs to recognize its home.

114
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:41,199
Now, I wanted to say something before we end about the sheer number of images on here,

115
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,741
the sheer kind of weight of the iconography.

116
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:48,910
Yes, I think it's important to remember or to distinguish between

117
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:57,234
the image of the pharaoh himself and these other images that we see carved around the throne.

118
00:07:58,755 --> 00:08:06,286
There's a difference between visual images and text, and because that difference is very clear in our culture,

119
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,686
images are pictures and text are letters.

120
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:15,748
It can be easy for us to forget that these pictures, these hieroglyphs are not pictures, this is text

121
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:22,199
and they're not to be interpreted as iconography here, that a bird here doesn't necessarily mean a bird.

122
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:24,436
A bird is a part of this word, it's text.

123
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:27,128
So, almost like an illuminated manuscript.

124
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,844
That's right, where the image is separate from the text

125
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:34,390
and the text is not meant to be appreciated as an esthetic visual experience.

126
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,700
So you get two different kinds of looking.

127
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,535
That's right.

128
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:43,366
So the iconography on the image itself is still enough to keep people entertained,

129
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:47,378
the bull's Tail, the Uraeus you mentioned, the headdress,

130
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:52,074
any other symbols of unity that we would be accustomed to seeing

131
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,202
are Old Kingdom statues...

132
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:58,375
Yes, some things carry through, the pleated kilt, the bull's Tail itself

133
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:02,709
which we haven't actually mentioned before which here actually appears to hang between

134
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,612
the pharaoh's legs in the front we're meant to imagine that it's coming down from his back.

135
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:15,474
That's also those kinds of symbols carried through throughout all three major periods of Egyptian art.

136
00:09:15,474 --> 00:09:19,550
So an expert could come and identify this maybe rather quickly as New Kingdom,

137
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:24,848
but for non-Egyptologists there's a consistency of imagery form Old Kingdom to New Kingdom,

138
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,626
that's really quite startling. Absolutely.
