Here's a diagram of the four chambers of the heart, so let's name them to get started.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We've got the right atrium up here, we've got the right ventricle down here, we've got the left atrium and the left ventricle.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the four chambers and blood is going to flow through all of them and get out to the body.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, to do this and to do this right the heart has got to coordinate how it squeezes.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We know that the way it squeezes down is you have a cell and that cell is usually negatively charged,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it will at some point become more positively charged. We call that process depolarization.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Depolarization is the idea of going from a negative membrane potential to something much more positive.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And when you depolarize is when the muscle cell can squeeze down.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, where does that begin? Let's actually draw it into our diagram.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you were to look there's actually an area here where little cells can actually depolarize by themselves.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that's actually quite unique because most of the cells inside the body are going to depolarize when the neighbor, when that neighboring cell depolarizes.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, these are actually really unique cells because they actually depolarize by themselves.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We call that area the sinoatrial node, sometimes called the SA node.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the fact that they can actually depolarize by themselves we have a word for that, too; we call that automaticity.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It just means that they can kind of automatically depolarize without having a neighbor do it first.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So once they depolarize, what happens after that?

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, when these cells depolarize they immediately, they're connected through little gap junctions to the neighboring muscle cells.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, they are going to start sending out waves of depolarization in all directions.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's almost like going to a football game and watching "The Wave" start, you know, it just goes on and on and on.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, all the neighboring cells are going to start depolarizing, as well.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That orange arrow is moving kind of slowly, right?

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That depolarization wave is moving kind of slowly relative to how fast it could be moving

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if it went through a specialized band of tissue.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this band of tissue I'm drawing, this blue band

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is almost like a highway compared to that orange arrow, which is like a little road.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that highway is going to take that same depolarization wave over to the other side,

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over to the left atrium and all of these cells begin to do the same thing, they start depolarizing, as well.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, you get depolarizing happening both in the right atrium and the left atrium in a coordinated way.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's happening all very evenly.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This band, or bundle, is called Bachmann's Bundle. It's like a bundle of tissue, right?

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's called Bachmann's Bundle.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we've named two things: the sinoatrial node and Bachmann's Bundle.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And actually just like Bachmann's Bundle there are actually a few more bands of tissue,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
almost like little highways, that take that signal down to another node called the atrioventricular node.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this right here is the atrioventricular node.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the atrioventricular node is really the only major connection, I shouldn't even say only major,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
only connection in most of us between the atria and the ventricles, the atrioventricular node.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is actually sometimes called the AV node.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The AV node is gonna get this signal and actually I didn't even tell you what a signal came through.
