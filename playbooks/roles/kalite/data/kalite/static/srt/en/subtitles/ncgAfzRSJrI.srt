You view the real Florence when you can see the bell tower

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Campanile, and in the centre on the lower left

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the just low cornered baptistry and on the back the cathedral

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of Florence which Brunelleschi's dome at the top. - Well, the baptistry

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a medieval building and from the tenth century probably

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the cathedral that we all know they began

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
building in the strand 1300 and the bell tower starts going up a little bit perhaps after that

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then the dome is built from the early 1400 and finished

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the 1470's. - So, what are we looking at with the bell tower?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the bell tower now we are going to concentrate on is the lower part of it

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
around 1340 even when the tower was not complete yet, they decided

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the town and the guild of Florence, specifically the world guild

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was in charge of decorating the cathedral

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
decided that they want to decorate the bottom of the tower

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because even though it was completely embarassing, having business there

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on decorated surface where one is walking around as you can see, all the time

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so the two very bottom layers are decorated

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with many reliefs designed in stone marble

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
rather than the bronze that is on the bapistry.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the reliefs cover a lot of subjects. there are typical scenes

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there are signs of the zodiac and there are also scenes of

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
local art and industry. Some of these things may sound unusual

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of course the biblical scenes make sense on such buildings

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well those might have been a little bit unusual

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll see why they might want to include those

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we should also say that the zodiac signs are

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not unusual because the medieval christians

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were very able, and very comfortably blended

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
their belief in christianity and christian devotion in

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with interest in horse gathering, we see that a lot in medieval trasures

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thats right.lets look at some of these relics

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
her is one of these religious scenes.this is

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the creation of adam.the artist is andrew epizano

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who at rather the same time is working on

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the bronze relics just across the street

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the side towards the bapistry. those secenes are about

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
john the bapist and here is one of the typical scenes on the bell tower

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and again this is typical of the zious belif

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
belief described at. it is very very simplified

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with mostly a blank background, just a few things to

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
give you a sense of the setting.there are a few stylysed trees

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we have god leaning over and creating adam

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
verily out of the dust of the earth he takes form. exactly.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is another good exampleo fhow at aura combines

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a graphic stylistion with a sort of naturalist classicism.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where do you see the graphic stylistion?

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well the figure of god the father some ways the robes

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
went about with a sense of the body underneath

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with a kind of ritual folds. all this is pretty

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
traditional so you ense of the body with not yet so

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
attire sensive and atomically correct and real physical

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
instead the figure adam is a nude athletic male

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know it is calassicising as well as naturalistic

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is in a contapastic stance even though

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is lying down. this does not make any sense

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for contra posture is usually for standing up.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the fact that he has done that anyway shows that

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how interested he was in giving alassical piecec

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thats true of his ribs muscles riht thro.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is quite typical of his style. you are now looking

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at one of the scenes of local industry. it

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is lot like one of the god fearing adam. it

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is interesting that you say that because the

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
industry that is represented here is sculpture and this is

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an interesting way for an artist tosuggest that the work of the sculpture

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is in some ways like the work of god. thos who are

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
creative in fact we see here that the creator here the artist

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
leaning over with stylised robes leaning over a nude

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
more naturalistic more classicising figure

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, of course, he is not going to get on trouble because of modesty here

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because look again and compare this to the way God creates Adan

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
God is innature and he uses a gesture of his hand

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and Adan is clearly sopposed to be a real living person

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When we look at the sculptor in the studio, he is in the studio,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he is using tools. The use of the tool is a really conspicuous.
