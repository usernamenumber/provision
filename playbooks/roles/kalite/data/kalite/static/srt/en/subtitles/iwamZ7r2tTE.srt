1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,730
We're on problem 221

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,720
And let's see, they have--is all of that in the denominator?

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,100
Well, I guess it is

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,700
Let's see, they wrote 1 over--

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,890
and I'll write it the way they did it

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,430
1 over-- and they have this--

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,410
you know, I think it's got to be 1 plus

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,220
I think it's 1 plus

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,410
The way they wrote it is weird

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:30,940
1 plus 1 over 1 plus 1/3

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,260
This looks a lot like another problem that we did

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,080
But anyway, I'll do this one

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,120
So let's see

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,880
If we do 1 plus 1/3, that's 3/3, plus 1/3, so that's 4/3

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,520
So then that turns into 4/3, 1, 1 plus, 1 over that

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,400
and then you have 1 plus that

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,050
And so then this equals 1 plus 1 over 1 plus--

18
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,270
what's 1 over 4/3?

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,340
Well, that's the same thing as--

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,310
1 divided by 4/3 is the the same thing as 1 times 3/4

21
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,090
and that's equal to 3/4

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,240
And what's 1 plus 3/4?

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,370
Well, that's 4/4 plus 3/4, right?

24
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,140
4/4 plus-- so that's 7/4

25
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,310
So then that becomes 1 plus 1 over 7/4

26
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:24,000
which is equal to 1 plus 4/7

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,890
and that equals 7/7 plus 4/7 is equal to 11/7

28
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,370
And that's choice D

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,040
The way they wrote it was weird

30
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,310
They wrote it like this, 1 plus down here

31
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,160
But I assume that this is what they wanted

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,970
what I originally had done

33
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,690
Problem 222

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,830
In the rectangular coordinate system above--

35
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,890
well, let me draw it

36
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,470
That's the y-axis, that's the x-axis

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,340
y, x

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,880
And they have a point out here called point p

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,360
and they say that's at 4. x equals 4, y equals 0

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,090
In the rectangular coordinate system above

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,680
if point r, not shown, lies on the positive y-axis

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,740
so it lies someplace over here

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,010
and the area of triangle orp , so this is point o

44
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,660
and r is going to be some place on this, is 12

45
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,940
what is the coordinate of the point r?

46
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,570
So the coordinate of the point r, let's just call it--

47
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,120
well the x-value is going to be 0, right?

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
And this y-value, I don't know, let's call it x

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,990
No, let's call it y

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,410
That's a better variable name for the y-value

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,000
So they essentially want to know what the area of this

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,690
triangle right here is

53
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,790
Or actually, they want to know what y is

54
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,360
given that the area of that triangle, they tell us, is 12

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
The area of this triangle is 12

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,020
So what's the area of this triangle?

57
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,260
It's the base times the height times 1/2

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,510
The base is 4, right?

59
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,660
This is x is equal to 4

60
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,850
So it's 4 times the height

61
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,160
Well, the height is going to be y, right?

62
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,260
Because the coordinate of r is 0 comma y

63
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,900
So 4 times y times 1/2-- if you don't do the 1/2

64
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,610
you're getting the area of the whole rectangle--

65
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,510
is equal to the area of the triangle is equal to 12

66
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,370
So you get 2y is equal to 12

67
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,580
y is equal to 6

68
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,460
So the coordinate of r is 0 comma 6

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,700
And that is choice--

70
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,560
oh, they just ask what is the y-coordinate of point r

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,490
So that's 6, and that's choice B

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:41,250
Problem 223

73
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,680
Car A is 20 miles behind car B

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,250
So let me see if I can draw that

75
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,440
So this is A, this is B-- and it's 20 miles behind it

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,460
I don't know if that's relevant-- which is traveling

77
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,930
in the same direction along the same route as car A

78
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,700
Car A is traveling at a constant speed of 58 miles per hour

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,170
so car A is at 58 miles per hour, and car B is

80
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,180
traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour

81
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,850
Fair enough

82
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,540
How many hours will it take for car A to overtake

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,930
and drive 8 miles ahead of car B?

84
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,030
So they don't want just car A to catch up

85
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,970
They want car A to catch up and go ahead 8 miles, right?

86
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,550
And drive 8 miles ahead

87
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,730
So another way to think about it is how long will it take

88
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,220
for car A to go 28 miles further than car B?

89
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,110
And the easiest way to think about it is just what their

90
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,140
differential is, right?

91
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,100
Car A is going 8 miles an hour faster than car B

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
So the relative velocity of A relative to B

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,180
is 8 miles an hour

94
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,770
And you could say that, well

95
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,800
I don't want to use fancy notation, but car A

96
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
if you're sitting in car B and you looked at car A

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,140
you'd say, oh, it's going in my same direction

98
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,400
but I'm stationary and it's going at 8 miles per hour

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,340
So the question essentially says if I'm going at 8 miles

100
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,040
per hour, how long does it take to go 28 miles, right?

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,090
Because I have to catch up to 20 miles with B

102
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,660
and then I have to go 8 more miles

103
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,500
You could just pretend like you are in car B and you think

104
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,560
that you are stationary

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,350
You ignore the fact that the world is speeding behind you

106
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,660
And you just see car A

107
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,870
You say, oh, car A must be moving at 8 miles an hour

108
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,220
in the direction in which my car is pointed

109
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,820
So, anyway, if you have to go 28 miles

110
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,200
and you're going at 8 miles per hour

111
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,500
distance divided by rate is equal to time

112
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:50,260
That's equal to 3 and 1/2 hours, which is choice E

113
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:57,490
Next question, 224

114
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,710
For the past n days

115
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,760
the average daily production at a company was 50 units

116
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:12,220
so for n days, 50 unit per day average

117
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,290
if today's production of 90 units, so we have 90 units

118
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,460
and that raises the average to 55 units per day

119
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,510
what was the value of n?

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:30,410
OK, so the old average would have been n times 50--

121
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,050
and this is kind of obvious --

122
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,510
divided by n is equal to 50, right?

123
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,280
Now, if I want to average in this 55

124
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:48,240
what happens is I get to n times 50, right?

125
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,640
That's the sum of the n days before

126
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,430
the sum of the total production for the n days before

127
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,620
And what I want to do is I want to have the production

128
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,440
for today, and that is 90, plus 90

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,040
and now I'm going to divide by n plus 1 days, right?

130
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,880
And now the average is 55

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,410
So we just have to solve this for n

132
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,080
So let's see what we can do

133
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,570
I'll do it in a different color

134
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,360
We get 50n plus 90 is equal to--

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:29,420
multiply both sides by n plus 1-- 55n plus 55

136
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,490
So let's subtract 50n from both sides

137
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,440
You get 90 is equal to 5n plus 55

138
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,730
Subtract 55 from both sides, 55 to 35 is equal to 5n

139
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,020
n is equal to 7

140
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,310
And that's choice E

141
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,650
Problem 225

142
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:06,090
OK, They write x plus 1 over x minus 1 squared

143
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,020
And they say if x does not equal 0 and x does not equal 1--

144
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,450
and that's good, because if x equaled 1

145
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,040
we'd be dividing by 0 here--

146
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,340
and if x is replaced by 1/x everywhere in the expression above

147
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,750
so x is replaced with 1/x everywhere in the expression above

148
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,550
then the resulting expression is equivalent to--

149
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,260
I don't know, let's just do it

150
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,310
So if we get 1/x-- we're just replacing x with 1/x-- plus 1

151
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:44,530
over 1/x minus 1 quantity squared

152
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,540
and that equals -- let's see

153
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,460
This is the same thing as 1/x plus x/x, right?

154
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,550
1 is the same thing as x/x

155
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,680
And this 1 is the same thing as x/x, right?

156
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,830
That's an x/x

157
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:07,720
So then this equals 1 plus x/x over 1 minus x/x

158
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,520
everything squared

159
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,820
And this inside of the brackets

160
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,330
that's the same thing as 1 plus x/x--

161
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,130
instead of being divided by this

162
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:24,080
we could multiply by the reciprocal-- times x over 1 minus x

163
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,110
I just reciprocated this and multiplied

164
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,810
And this is all still in the squared

165
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,540
Now these x's cancel out, and lo and behold, we get 1 plus x

166
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:47,050
over 1 minus x squared,which is the same thing as x plus 1--

167
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:57,220
well, let's think about it. x plus 1 over 1 minus x squared

168
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,930
And see, that's not one of the choices, right?

169
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,580
But let's think about it

170
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,940
1 minus x, that's the same thing as--just let me rewrite it

171
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,630
This is the same thing as x plus 1 divided by--

172
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,370
now this 1 minus x is the same thing as x minus 1

173
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,500
times negative 1, right?

174
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,560
And we're going to square all of this

175
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,800
Well, this over here, this is the same thing as x plus 1

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,100
over x minus 1 squared times 1 over negative 1 squared,right?

177
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,830
If you take the square of a product, you could--

178
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,730
this is the same thing as that times 1 over negative 1

179
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,780
So that turns into this, and this, obviously if I'm

180
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,400
squaring another number, this just becomes 1

181
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,160
So I'm left with x plus 1 over x minus 1 squared

182
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,460
And that's exactly what we started off with

183
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,240
and that's choice A

184
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
And that's the trick, to realize that

185
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,130
this is just a negative of x minus 1

186
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,350
And you can take a negative 1 out

187
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,600
but we're going to square it anyway

188
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,040
so it's going to turn it back positive

189
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,390
Next question

190
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,760
In choice E, actually, in that one

191
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,500
they tempt you by taking the negative outside

192
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,050
but you can't take the negative outside the square

193
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,230
You're squaring it, so the negative will disappear

194
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,320
Anyway, problem 200

195
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,210
Oh, I'm all out of time

196
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,000
