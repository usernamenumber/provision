1
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:05,800
Consider the numbers 1/3 , 7 , -15

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,933
To which of these sets of numbers

3
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,400
these numbers belong to. Lets review each of these

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,600
Natural numbers are counting numbers

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,000
not equal 0. it is 1,2,3,... so on and so forth

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The whole numbers are natural numbers plus 0

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,400
Whole numbers are 0,1,2,3,4

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,533
The integers is the whole numbers plus opposite of it

9
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:53,133
It is whole numbers plus negative of natural numbers

10
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,600
like -4,-3,-2,-1

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,400
0, 1, 2, 3,4, ... so on and so forth

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,867
rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed

13
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:10,867
as a ratio of two integers.Rational number can be

14
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:16,200
expressed as m/n where m and n are integers

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,000
and n cannot be 0 as anything divided by 0

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
is not defined. But m could be 0

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:35,600
as 0 can be expressed as 0/1 or 0/2 or 0/3

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:50,800
or 0/-537 these are all representations of 0

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,733
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot

20
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:56,733
be expressed as ratios of integers

21
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,733
examples of irrational numbers are numbers that

22
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,867
keeps repeating on and on and on

23
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:14,733
π, √2 are examples of irrational numbers

24
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:27,467
and then real numbers are really all of these combined

25
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,467
if you are combining the rational numbers

26
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:32,533
and irrational numbers you are talking

27
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,133
about real numbers.every real number

28
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,867
is either rational or irrational.

29
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,200
lets classify what we have

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:52,667
1/3 is not a natural number as it is not

31
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,467
a counting number. It is not a whole number

32
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:59,333
it is not an integer.is it a rational number

33
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,933
sure it is as 1 and 3 are integers. so 1/3

34
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:14,000
is a rational number.if something is rational

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,867
it cannot be irrational and it is also a real number

36
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:31,800
lets try 7

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,733
number 7 is a natural number, whole number

38
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:44,933
any natural is a whole number

39
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,867
any natural and whole number si an integer

40
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:51,467
so 7 is also a integer.

41
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,467
any number that is natural, whole and integer

42
00:03:54,467 --> 00:04:02,933
is a rational number. we can write 7 as 7/1

43
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,867
we can write any integer as that number / 1

44
00:04:06,867 --> 00:04:14,867
if it is rational it cannot be irrational.

45
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:20,733
it is also going to be real

46
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:40,200
we have -15.

47
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,733
it is not a natural number

48
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:50,933
natural number are positive integers only

49
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:55,200
it is not a whole number

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,533
it is an integer, it is the opposite of +15

51
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:07,800
it is rational as it can be written as -15/1

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,467
and because it is rational it cannot be irrational

53
00:05:12,467 --> 99:59:59,999
it is also real.
