1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,030
We're on problem 237.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:09,900
A part-time employee whose hourly wage was increased by 25%

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,260
decided to reduce the number of hours worked per week

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,300
so that the employee's total weekly income

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,640
would remain unchanged.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,630
By what percent should the number of hours worked be reduced?

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,020
So before, he made his hourly wage times hours worked, right?

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,920
This is what he would normally work in a week, right?

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,920
So his wage per hour times hours per week.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,020
This is what he used to make.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,980
But now what he's done is

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,520
since he's making 25% more of his wage,

13
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,690
he's going to reduce his hours by some number,

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,420
by some fraction. Right?

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,030
Let's call that x.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,200
So then the new wage times the new hours , and they're saying

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,440
that he doesn't want to change the total amount

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,320
that he makes in a week.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,790
So the new wage times the new hours will equal w times h.

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,340
Let's divide both sides by w.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,420
This goes to 1, that goes to 1.

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,020
Divide both sides by h.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,000
That goes to 1, that goes to 1.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,060
And you're left with 1 is equal to 1.25 times x.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,400
And I view that-- this is easier to think of as what?

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,970
5/4, right?

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,620
1.25-- right?

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,610
4/4 is 1, and then you add another 1/4.

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,460
This is 1 and 1/4, so this is 5/4.

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,240
So let's write that as 5/4x.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,870
Multiply both sides by 4/5, you get x is equal to 4/5,

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,030
which is equal to 0.8.

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,210
So another way to view it is he would reduce--

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,710
he's working 80% of the hours that he used to work,

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,900
so he reduced by 20% the amount that he worked.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,080
And that will be choice B.

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,480
Next problem, 238.

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,020
OK, they've drawn us a figure, so let's draw the figure.

39
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,050
Let me see if I could make it thicker.

40
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,920
OK, so they drew a box in a box,

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,070
and there's another box in that box,

42
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,010
and it looks something like that.

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,030
And then they shaded it in, so I'll shade it in.

44
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,330
And they say that this side up here is 18,

45
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,050
and they say that this side over here is 15.

46
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,450
The shaded region in the figure above represents a

47
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,020
rectangular frame with length 18 inches and width 15 inches.

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,190
The frame encloses a rectangular picture

49
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,550
that has the same area as this frame itself.

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,350
So this area is equal to this area.

51
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,040
Fascinating.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,990
If the length and width of the picture have the same ratio

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,400
as the length and width of the frame,

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,950
what is the length of the picture in inches?

55
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,280
So they're saying that this is the length, so this is l.

56
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,490
And this is the width.

57
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,630
And they want us to solve for l.

58
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,000
What is the length of the picture, right?

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,880
They're calling-- I mean, I would call that width,

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,510
but they originally say the frame with length 18 inches.

61
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,440
So they want to know the length of the picture.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,030
OK, first of all, they tell us that the ratios are the same.

63
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,190
So l:w of the picture is the same ratio

64
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,810
as it is for the frame, is 18:15.

65
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,890
You divide by 3.

66
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,520
That's the same thing as 6:5, right? l:w is equal to 6:5.

67
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,590
And the other thing they told us is that the area

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
of the picture the same as the area of the frame.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,940
So the area the picture is l times w,

70
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,030
and what's the area the frame?

71
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,090
What's the area of this whole thing , which is 15 times 18,

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,760
minus the area of the picture, right?

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,470
Because the area of the frame is not this whole rectangle.

74
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,590
It's just the part that doesn't have the picture in it,

75
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,090
so minus l times w.

76
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,470
So if we add lw to both sides,

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,000
we get 2lw is equal to 15 times 18.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm just going to leave that as 15 times 18.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,140
Let's see, we could already divide both sides by 2,

80
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:27,000
so you get lw is equal to 15 times 9.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,390
And let's see, we have two equations with two unknowns.

82
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,210
Let's see if we can solve.

83
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,900
So we have l/w is equal to 6/5.

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,450
We can cross-multiply, so we get 5l is equal to 6w.

85
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,090
I ignored the stuff in the middle.

86
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,920
And we want to solve for l, right?

87
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,340
So let's substitute for w.

88
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,690
So we get 5/6l is equal to w,

89
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,480
and now let's substitute that into this equation.

90
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:03,880
So we have l times w, which is 5/6l, is equal to 15 times 9.

91
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,680
And let's see, let's multiply both sides by 6/5, and so you

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:21,020
would get l squared is equal to 15 times 9 times 6 over 5.

93
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,500
So let's see, we could do a little simplification.

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,260
This becomes 3, this becomes 1, and then we have--

95
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,430
let's see, now we have to do some math.

96
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,400
3 times 9 is 27.

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,030
27 times 6 is what?

98
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,010
7 times 6 is 42.

99
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:55,030
2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 161.

100
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,010
That's a strange number.

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,440
So let's see if I can simplify this.

102
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,310
Oh, I'm looking at choices,

103
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,570
and they have all sorts of crazy square roots in it.

104
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:11,030
So let's just say that l is equal to the square root of--

105
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,060
let's see, how can we rewrite this?

106
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,270
We could rewrite the 6 as 3 times 2, right?

107
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,920
So then we get 3 times 9 times 3,

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
that's the same thing as 9 times 9.

109
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,510
That's 81, right?

110
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,000
81 times 2.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And we have a 1 in the denominator.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,330
So l is equal to 9, and I'll do one more step,

113
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,280
because I think this confuses a lot of people.

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,820
That's equal to the square root of 81

115
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,890
times the square root of 2,

116
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,680
which is equal to 9 square roots of 2,

117
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,370
which is choice A.

118
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:53,070
Problem 239.

119
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,530
Of the 200 students at College T majoring in one or more

120
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,060
of the sciences-- I already feel a Venn diagram coming on.

121
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,420
Of the 200 students at College T majoring in one or more

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,300
of the sciences, 130 are majoring-- so let me draw the wholeŁŹ

123
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,500
well, let me read the whole problem.

124
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,430
130 are majoring in chemistry and 150 are majoring in biology

125
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,270
If at least 30 of the students

126
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,730
are not majoring in either chemistry or biology,

127
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,380
then the number of students majoring in

128
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,750
both chemistry and biology can be any number from--

129
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,030
OK, let me draw the Venn diagram.

130
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,660
So that's chemistry, that's biology,

131
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,560
and then there's a leftover, right?

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,060
This is a whole pool.

133
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,990
So they tell us there's 200 total, right?

134
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,440
There's 200 total.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,170
And they say that 130 are majoring in chemistry,

136
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:52,990
150 in biology, and then at least 30 of the students

137
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,820
are not majoring in either chemistry or biology,

138
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,530
so we could say greater than or equal to 30.

139
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,220
So this is driving a little spin here

140
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,020
by making it an inequality.

141
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,210
Then the number of students majoring in

142
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,850
both chemistry and biology could be any number from--

143
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,600
OK, so let's say that this is 30,

144
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,010
just to simplify our thinking.

145
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,340
If this is 30,

146
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,020
how many people are majoring in chemistry or biology?

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,010
Well, then it's 170, right?

148
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,490
So let's think of it this way.

149
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,990
Let's think of this as the intercept-- this is both.

150
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,850
Well, I used B for biology.

151
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,580
So let's call this-- I don't know, let's call this--

152
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,020
I used C for combined.

153
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,070
So let's call this I for the intersection.

154
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,100
So if 30 people are majoring in--

155
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,070
well, actually, let's just call this x.

156
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,130
So how many people are majoring in--

157
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,840
if I wanted to add these two numbers up,

158
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,820
if I want to know the people who are in chemistry or biology,

159
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,000
what would it be?

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,250
It would be 130 plus 150, and remember, and we've done this

161
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,150
a couple of times with these Venn diagram problems,

162
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,680
if I counted these 130, and then I count these 150,

163
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,380
I've counted this intersection twice.

164
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,720
I counted it with the 130, and I counted with the 150.

165
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,750
So I have to subtract out at least the intersection once.

166
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,020
So I subtract it out once.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,890
So these are the number of people who are in chemistry

168
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,920
or biology or both, right?

169
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,060
So it's the intersection of chemistry or biology or both.

170
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,600
And now we know that that has got to be equal to what?

171
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,920
Well, 200 minus the people who are in nothing, right?

172
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,020
So I'm going to call that x for now.

173
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,540
200 minus the people who are nothing.

174
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,530
And let's see if we can solve for the intersection,

175
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,980
which is what they're asking us in terms of x.

176
00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:02,020
So this becomes 280 minus I is equal to 200 minus x.

177
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,830
And then they tell us to subtract 200 from both sides.

178
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,090
You get 80 minus I is equal to minus x.

179
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,740
Let's add I to both sides.

180
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,740
So you get 80 is equal to I minus x, right?

181
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,000
Or even better, let's add x to both sides.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,030
So you get I is equal to 80 plus x.

183
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,740
And so, if x is greater than or equal to 30--

184
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,970
so we know that if x is 30, then we get what?

185
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,240
We get 130 plus 80 is 110, right?

186
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,030
So we know that I is going to be greater than or equal to 110

187
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,030
The intersection is at least 110.

188
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,900
Now, what's an upper bound on it?

189
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,750
How many people can be studying both?

190
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,980
And if you look at the choices already, there's two choices

191
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,010
that have 110 as the minimum for the number studying both.

192
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,000
But what's the maximum that can be studying both?

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,650
Well, it's 130, right?

194
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,760
If all the chemistry people are also studying biology,

195
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,020
then the intersection becomes 130, right?

196
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,370
But you can't have 150 people studying both,

197
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,360
because there's only 130 studying chemistry.

198
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,670
So the intersection is greater than or equal to 110.

199
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,480
And it's limited by the number of people studying chemistry,

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,030
130, which is choice D.

201
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,070
And I'll see you in the next video.
