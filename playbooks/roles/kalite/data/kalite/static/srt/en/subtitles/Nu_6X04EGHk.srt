1
00:00:04,849 --> 00:00:08,199
Here we are in a virtual world that recreates

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,000
Hadrian's villa the way that it looked in the second century

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,017
AD, created by Dr. Bernie Frischer and, Bernie,

4
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,967
you're here in the virtual world with us.

5
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,218
Yes, I'm really Hadrianus.

6
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:21,333
You're seeing me right now,

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,116
so this is really my place.

8
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:24,733
I built it between 117

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,866
and when I died in 138

10
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,968
and now I've come back to Earth

11
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,733
and to life to show you around.

12
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,300
And I noticed you have a beard,

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,533
and I don't think most emperors

14
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,199
did before you?

15
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:36,683
One ancient biographer said it was

16
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:37,999
because I had acne and I was

17
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:38,733
trying to hide it,

18
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:40,150
but that is not true!

19
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,366
The real reason is, I loved

20
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:45,499
Athens and the Athenian philosophical schools,

21
00:00:45,499 --> 00:00:47,816
and all philosophers wore beards.

22
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,249
And here we are in your villa,

23
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,649
which is located outside of Rome.

24
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,167
So how long did you work on this?

25
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,833
Really, from the moment I became Emperor in 117.

26
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:56,917
I started thinking, Wouldn't it be good

27
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:57,916
to have a government retreat

28
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,027
outside of Rome, but near Rome?

29
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:02,235
And one reason that I thought that was that

30
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,526
because, unfortunately, in my

31
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,601
early days as Emperor in 117, I had to

32
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,581
put three senators to death,

33
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:08,915
so that always made me a

34
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,699
little bit sheepish about being in Rome.

35
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,365
How big is this villa?

36
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,566
Well you would say about

37
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:15,749
two hundred, two hundred-fifty

38
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,933
acres. And there are thirty

39
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:19,716
major building complexes. I was

40
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:22,317
an amateur architect, and I just

41
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:24,300
kept building and building. I was a bit of a maniac

42
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,816
when it came to building.

43
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:28,389
My predecessor and relative's chief

44
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,289
architect, Apollodorus of Damascus

45
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,656
said some very unkind things

46
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:32,723
about a building I designed

47
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:33,849
in Rome, so I forced him

48
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:35,517
to commit suicide, but that

49
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:38,049
just shows how much I loved architecture.

50
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,033
There are libraries here, there are temples,

51
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:43,866
there are living quarters, there are baths.

52
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:48,032
There are sculpture gardens, ponds, and fountains.

53
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,800
There are dining halls,

54
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,366
indoor winter dining halls

55
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,033
and outdoor summer dining halls,

56
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,316
so you really can have a good

57
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,667
time here all year round.

58
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:59,533
And it's kind of a city in miniature - Rome in miniature.

59
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,717
This was fabulously decorated.

60
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,766
None of that lower-class painted fresco

61
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:06,634
for me. We used only cut marble on the walls

62
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,883
and on the floors, and we brought in marbles

63
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:12,635
from all over the empire to use here.

64
00:02:12,635 --> 00:02:14,399
Even, you know, we're now looking at this

65
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,584
obelisk right in front of me,

66
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,799
granite from Egypt. This is

67
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,450
somehow expressive of the

68
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,066
power of Rome and all of its

69
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,749
wealth and resources.

70
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:24,466
Could you take us on a tour of some

71
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,616
of the highlights of your villa?

72
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:27,533
I would be happy to do that.

73
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:30,316
So just follow me, and we'll

74
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,384
go out to a road that's in front.

75
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:34,583
We can see that the end

76
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,449
of the road is a big structure

77
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,083
called the vestibule, by you moderns.

78
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,999
That was the receiving area

79
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,285
for all important guests coming

80
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,499
from Rome. And you know, when you

81
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,916
arrive, you tend to be a

82
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,983
bit grimy and tired, so

83
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,051
right next to the vestibule, we

84
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,366
put a beautiful bath building. And then,

85
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:53,916
when you finish bathing, you

86
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,468
could have a meal. And then

87
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,699
if I did receive you, it

88
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,766
would have been in

89
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,249
one of the many audience halls

90
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:00,999
in the villa. This is a hall

91
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,466
that could actually have held hundreds of people,

92
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,084
and the villa in its heyday,

93
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,282
for example, when the Senate visited me

94
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,034
out here, could have

95
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:11,684
had hundreds of guests. This

96
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,717
is the very first reception hall.

97
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,399
I noticed these lovely views

98
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,683
when I look through the

99
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:18,399
doorways and the windows.

100
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,916
I'm very interested in views

101
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,866
and I'm very interested in

102
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,899
direting the gaze of the viewer

103
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,915
to what I want him or her to see.

104
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:26,483
Right now, we're looking straight

105
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,499
ahead at a very famous part

106
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,949
of the villa, which I think

107
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,051
occurs in many textbooks of your

108
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,233
young students. It's called the

109
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,249
Canopus, and I put one of

110
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,416
my most creative pieces of

111
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,634
architecture there. It's actually

112
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:41,234
a curved colonnade and the

113
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,800
part of the colonnade above

114
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,665
the columns we call the

115
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:46,599
architrave. It's actually arched.

116
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,016
underneath the arches I put some of

117
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:51,050
my favorite statues. I wanted to make sure that

118
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,099
even at the moment of arrival, my important

119
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,800
visitors would be able to see and admire my design.

120
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,682
And your sculture that decorated the villa

121
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:04,283
this is all inspired by ancient Greek sculpture but also

122
00:04:04,283 --> 00:04:06,533
some ancient Egyptian sculpture.

123
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:10,749
I had copies made of my favorite types of Egyptian and

124
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:13,099
Greek and even Roman sculpture. But I also

125
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,935
commissioned some new pieces. I had two highly talented

126
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,199
sculptors who worked for me, I brought from Aphrodisias

127
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,484
in the middle of modern-day Turkey, Papus and Aristeas,

128
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:26,249
and they made some beautiful pieces I am told are

129
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,332
still well-preserved today and can be seen in the

130
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:29,760
Capitoline Museum.

131
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,516
Could you take us to see the so-called Canopus?

132
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:36,083
I'd be happy to. We're down in the Canopus

133
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,766
at the end looking toward one of my very

134
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:41,183
favorite parts of the villa, the so-called

135
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:45,532
Serapeum, temple of Serapis. This is not a

136
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,249
temple at all, really, but an outdoor

137
00:04:47,249 --> 00:04:50,516
dining area, where we love to eat in the summer.

138
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,933
So I mentioned that after you arrived in the

139
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:53,833
vestibule and bathe, you might be invited

140
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,349
to an audience with me, but you also might

141
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,416
be invited directly to dine with me. You

142
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,133
can see how I cleverly designed this place

143
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,433
to be very refreshing, because it's filled

144
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,833
with cascades of water from my own

145
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:10,766
private aqueduct. The semi-circular structure right

146
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,300
in front of us is a so-called stibadium. It's

147
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,317
a big couch, and we could have twenty

148
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,766
or thirty diners banqueting with us on that couch.

149
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,748
Of course, we would put down our

150
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:22,033
cushions. Right now, you're looking at a

151
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,683
colonnade with Corinthian capitals. One

152
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:26,849
thing you don't see is something

153
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,566
I loved and that I revived in other parts of the

154
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,499
villa: the Doric order. Not so frequently used in

155
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,683
Roman imperial architecture, where everything

156
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,800
before me tended to be Corinthian. But

157
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,149
I loved the Doric order as well. Again,

158
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,199
it reminds me of Athens and Greece.

159
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,533
I also heard you were a religious man.

160
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,384
I am. There's no one more religious than me.

161
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:50,515
After all, I am a future God and therefore have

162
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:52,733
to maintain respect for the Gods. I built

163
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:54,883
temples all over the place, including right

164
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:55,899
here at the villa.

165
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,849
Should we go visit one?

166
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,300
So we've just teleported from the Sarapeum to the

167
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,700
so-called Roccabruna, that's just

168
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,249
a modern-name. On top is a temple, in the Doric

169
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,933
order, but even more interesting is

170
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,884
the sanctuary of the goddess Isis that

171
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:14,334
I put in a rotunda below.

172
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,199
If you look around, the sanctuary, ah,

173
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,900
there we can see the priest. We have

174
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,433
a rotunda that's actually two-thirds the

175
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,332
size of the Pantheon.

176
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:23,899
The candelabra we see in front of us

177
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:26,234
are decorated with bases that have

178
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,599
images pertaining to the cult of Isis.

179
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,899
We can see in front of us the

180
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,915
statue of Isis, which is now in a museum of

181
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:35,699
Rome. Isis was the queen of heaven.

182
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,665
As such, she rules over not only the earth

183
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:41,366
but the sky. And her festival in Rome was

184
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:46,033
on the summer solstice. We turn our clock back to the

185
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,649
summer solstice at sunset and now we look

186
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,599
at the statue, we can see how I have aligned

187
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,916
the statue in the niche exactly so that at

188
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,615
sunset it would be all lit up on the summer solstice

189
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,999
That's fabulous! And there's a

190
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,749
frescoed ceiling on the dome.

191
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:02,700
There is! The ceiling had a dome of

192
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,635
heaven motif that I put in with the Sun God on his

193
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,784
chariot at the peak of the dome and the zodiac at the lower

194
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:12,584
register of the dome. And, look what we

195
00:07:12,584 --> 00:07:16,782
find right over Isis. We find the twins, Gemini.

196
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:18,832
I put them there because the last day of

197
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,166
Gemini is the summer solstice, so this is all

198
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,833
oriented very much towards the summer

199
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,884
solstice and sunset on the summer solstice,

200
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:29,099
because that is a day very important to Isis.

201
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,712
I'm honored that you gave us this tour.

202
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:31,458
Thank you!

203
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,625
You're welcome.
