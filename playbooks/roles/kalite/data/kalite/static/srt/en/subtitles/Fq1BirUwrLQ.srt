1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,420
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,050
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,470
I actually had to take a
five-second pause because

5
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,560
something came up, but
let me continue.

6
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,180
Problem number 10.

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,530
So let's see, they say that
this is x degrees.

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,260
So there's a formula for the
angles inside of a polygon,

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,990
but what I'm going to do is
derive it for you, because

10
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,320
frankly, on an exam you can--
well, later in life, it's very

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,570
easy to forget everything.

12
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,750
   

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,560
So what I do is, we know that
all of the angles are

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,290
congruent, right?

15
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,390
So if we know that this is--
let's call this angle y, then

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,890
this angle is going to be y,
this angle going to be y, that

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:49,950
is y, that's y, that's y, that's
y, that's y, that's y,

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,950
that's y, right?

19
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,030
All of these angles
are the same.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,580
And what do we know about
these angles here?

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,930
Let's called these
z, z, z, z, z.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,545
There are five of these z angles
and what are they going

23
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,470
to add up to be?

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,350
Well, they go around
in a circle, right?

25
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,470
So these five z angles
are going to have to

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,316
add up to 360 degrees.

27
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:15,660
So we could say 5z is equal
to 360 degrees.

28
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:25,370
z is equal to-- let's see, 5
goes into 360, 7, 35, 10, 72.

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,960
So z is equal to 72 degrees.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,480
So each of these z's
is 72 degrees.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,760
That angle of 72 degrees,
what are the y's?

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Well, y plus y plus z has
to be 180, right?

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,530
So you have y plus y plus 72
is equal to 180 degrees.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,350
2y plus 72 is equal to 180.

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,430
2y is equal to what?

36
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,166
108.

37
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,670
And actually we could
solve for y.

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,330
y is 54.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,580
But really we just want
to know what 2y is

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,430
because look at this.

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,656
We're trying to solve for x.

42
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:11,850
x plus 2y is 180, right?

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,912
How did I get that?

44
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:15,280
x is supplementary
with y and y.

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,710
This is 2y right here and
altogether they are

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,480
supplementary.

47
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,650
So that's where I get
x plus 2y is 180.

48
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,650
We know what 2y is.

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,236
It's 108.

50
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:28,868
x plus 108 is equal to 180.

51
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:32,940
x is equal to-- and actually,
it's interesting. x is going

52
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,800
to be equal to z, right?

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,250
x is 72 degrees.

54
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,160
And that is choice C.

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,590
And that actually is
interesting that x

56
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,410
is the same as z.

57
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,130
And actually, when you think
about it, it makes sense

58
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,460
because y plus y plus z is 180,
and here, y plus y plus x

59
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,570
has to be 180.

60
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,320
So x is going to
be equal to z.

61
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,660
You say there are 360 degrees
in the circle.

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,760
Divide by the number of z's
there are, one, two, three,

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,050
four, five, you get 72.

64
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,300
Next problem.

65
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,880
   

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,360
Problem 11.

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,090
The length of a drawing of a
tool is 3/8 of the length of

68
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,190
the actual tool.

69
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:23,630
OK, if the length of the drawing
of the tool is 6

70
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:31,600
inches, what is the length in
inches of the actual tool?

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,860
OK, 6 inches is equal to 3/8
times the actual tool.

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,360
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by the

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,830
reciprocal of this right here.

74
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:49,090
So let's say 8/3 times 6 is
equal to 8/3 times 3/8a.

75
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,190
This, of course, cancels out.

76
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,420
That's why I multiplied
by the reciprocal.

77
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,190
And this becomes a 2,
this becomes a 1.

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,530
8 times 2 is 16.

79
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,530
So the actual tool
is 16 inches.

80
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,290
And that's choice C.

81
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,590
Next problem.

82
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,555
Problem 12.

83
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,020
I might have space
to do it here.

84
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,110
   

85
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,779
If x plus 3/2 is an integer-- so
they're saying x plus 3 is

86
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,360
divisible by 2, right?

87
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,269
Because in order for this to be
an integer-- and so what do

88
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,010
we know about x?

89
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:28,130
Well, x plus 3 has to be
even number, right?

90
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,830
Because it's divisible by 2.

91
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,510
So that must mean that x has
to be an odd number.

92
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,300
How do I know that?

93
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,270
So I know that x
plus 3 is even.

94
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,300
   

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,080
If x plus 3 is even, then
I know that x is odd.

96
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,060
Why is that?

97
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,680
Because 3 is odd.

98
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,480
The only way, if I had one
number plus an odd and I get

99
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,500
an even, this number has
to be odd as well.

100
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,670
2 odds added together equal
an even, right?

101
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,210
For example, 5 plus 3 is
8, or 11 plus 3 is 14.

102
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,330
So an odd plus an
odd is an even.

103
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,850
So x has to be odd.

104
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,100
So when we look at the choices,
we have choice E.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,100
x is an odd integer.

106
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,390
That's the only thing that we
can really assume based on

107
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,370
this, and that's because x
plus 3 has to be even.

108
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,230
And anything plus an odd and
you get an even, that thing

109
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,050
you added to the odd has
to be odd as well.

110
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,420
And you can try it
out with numbers.

111
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,670
Next problem.

112
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,650
   

113
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,610
Problem 13.

114
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,000
All right.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,230
In the x, y plane above, points
q and s are the centers

116
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,140
of the circle.

117
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,190
Which are tangent
to the x-axis?

118
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,670
Let me see if I can draw this.

119
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,260
   

120
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,530
So this is the y-axis.

121
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,420
This is the x-axis.

122
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,930
And now they draw a
couple of circles.

123
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,035
A small one and a big one.

124
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,210
Let's see if I can draw it.

125
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,800
The small circle looks
something like that.

126
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,750
   

127
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,390
And the big circle doesn't
touch the small circle.

128
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:25,000
So the big circle looks
something like that.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,766
Fair enough.

130
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:31,650
Let's see, this is point Q.

131
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,786
This is point S and those
are the centers.

132
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:41,686
And they tell us that this point
right here is 3 comma 6,

133
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:47,305
and this point up here
is 11 comma 10.

134
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,400
And what else?

135
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,060
This is point R.

136
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:58,590
this is point P, QS, oh, and
then one last thing, I'm

137
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,270
drawing this line here
and a line here.

138
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,630
   

139
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,500
In both cases, they say this
is a perpendicular.

140
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,350
Let's do the problem.

141
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,790
In the x, y plane above, points
Q and S are the centers

142
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,880
of the circle, which are tangent
to the x-axis, right?

143
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,260
They just barely touch the
x-axis right here.

144
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,620
That's the x-axis.

145
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,870
What is the slope of line QS?

146
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,490
So what is the slope
of this line?

147
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,000
   

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,510
Line QS?

149
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,233
And it could go further out like
that, go further in this

150
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,670
direction like that.

151
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,850
So we really just have
to figure out the

152
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,640
coordinates Q and S.

153
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,190
So Q is the center of this, so
it's tangent to the x-axis.

154
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,070
This entire diameter has what?

155
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,680
Has height what?

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,100
Height 6.

157
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,190
So this the point 3.

158
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,330
This is 3, 6, so what's
this Q going to be?

159
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,060
The x is definitely going to
still be 3 and the y is going

160
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,030
to be halfway to
this top point.

161
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,230
Well, what's halfway to 6?

162
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,200
3.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,950
Similarly, this is point 11
comma 10, so the x-coordinate

164
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,130
is 11 and this y-coordinate
is to 10.

165
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,320
So what's the coordinate
of S going to be?

166
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,520
The x-coordinate is, of course,
still going to be 11.

167
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,550
And the y-coordinate is going
to be halfway to 10.

168
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,340
What's halfway to 10?

169
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,360
It's 5.

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,220
So what's the slope?

171
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,040
Slope is change in y
over change in x.

172
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,640
So let's take the y's.

173
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:41,520
It's 5 minus 3 over
11 minus 3.

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,770
That equals 2/9.

175
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,830
   

176
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,740
No, sorry, 2/8.

177
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,880
I always mess up
on that stuff.

178
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,420
11 minus 3 is 8.

179
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,800
So 2/8 and that equals 1/4.

180
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,534
And that is choice D.

181
00:08:57,534 --> 00:09:00,320
I'll see you in the
next video.
