1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,100
So we now know that there are
two ways that a company can

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,440
raise capital.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,120
It can do it by borrowing
money, which is debt.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,970
Or by selling shares of
itself, or essentially

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,230
allowing other people to become
partial owners of it,

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,330
and that is equity.

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,620
And these directly translate
into securities, that you're

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,930
probably familiar with, but
maybe you didn't have a more

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,940
exact idea of what they are.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,725
You know what equity securities
are, and just so

12
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,730
you know, what is a security?

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,630
A security is essentially
something that can be bought

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,610
and sold that has some type of
claim on something, or some

15
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,270
type of economic value.

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,750
So a security in the equity
world is a stock.

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,250
And a security in the debt
world is a bond.

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,110
Let me explain it.

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,310
So let me just draw the
balance sheet for the

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,785
fictional company.

21
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,890
It was pointed out to me that
socks.com actually is not a

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,620
fictional company.

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,700
That someone is indeed
selling socks online.

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,020
   

25
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,630
Which, by the way, I think
is a great idea.

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,430
So let's see, I have my
assets right here.

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,615
These are the assets
of the company.

28
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:11,790
But that's not what we're
worried about right now.

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,170
And let me draw the equity
of the company.

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,190
This is maybe shares
that they sold.

31
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,220
So let's say that they
have-- that there

32
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,410
are 10 million shares.

33
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,450
And then we have the debt, the
debt of the company, or the

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,070
liabilities.

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,000
There are other liabilities
other than debt, per se, but

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,380
that's all we'll worry
about right now.

37
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,080
This is the debt.

38
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,330
I'll do it in brown.

39
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,600
We have the debt.

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,420
   

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,550
And maybe the assets-- let me
just think of a good round

42
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,490
number-- the assets are
$10 million in assets.

43
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,440
And let's say our debt
is $6 million.

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,560
And then what's left over for
the equity-- and the way you

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,870
have to view it is OK, if I
have $10 million and I owe

46
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,700
people $6 million, what's left
for the owners of the company?

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,840
Well, the owners of
the company will

48
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,220
have $4 million left.

49
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,220
And it will be split amongst
the owners of the company.

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,000
And there's 10 million
individual shares.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,830
So every person who has one of
those stock certificates will

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,850
own one ten-millionth of this
$4 million, or essentially,

53
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,590
$0.40 a share, or something.

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,680
So anyway, this is-- and I think
you're familiar with

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,030
this already-- this is
essentially stock.

56
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,870
When we say 10 million
shares, that's 10

57
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,550
million shares of stock.

58
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,640
I could just draw 10 million
stock certificates.

59
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,960
And, I guess, whatever
the ticker symbol is.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,650
And there could be 10
million of those.

61
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,980
Now debt is interesting.

62
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,620
There's a lot of ways you can
raise debt, and actually

63
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,530
there's a lot of ways you
could raise equity, it

64
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,540
actually doesn't have
to be with selling.

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,950
Well, for the most part
you are selling stock.

66
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,640
You could maybe think of some
other way, and we'll talk

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,230
about other forms of
equity, preferred

68
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,250
stock and all of that.

69
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,700
But in the simplest level,
you're really

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,100
always selling stock.

71
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,330
Debt's a little different.

72
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,320
Debt could be just in the
form of a bank loan.

73
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,990
So this could be a bank loan,
where you literally go to the

74
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,620
bank and say hey, I need $6
million, and they say OK, here

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,400
you go, and we'll give it to you
for this interest. And you

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
have to pay back the money,
above and beyond the interest,

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,070
over this time schedule.

78
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,320
So it's not too different
than maybe a mortgage.

79
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,050
Or they might say OK, you pay
the interest for five years,

80
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,900
and at the end of the five years
you also have to pay the

81
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,780
principal amount.

82
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,030
So you have to pay the
whole $6 million.

83
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,750
Or you maybe have to come
up with a new loan or

84
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,270
something like that.

85
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,710
So that would just
be a bank loan.

86
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,440
There's other things that are
revolving lines of credit,

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,960
which is kind of like a
company's credit card to some

88
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,170
degree, that it doesn't
have to use it.

89
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,120
But if it does, that's kind of
debt the company takes on.

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,950
But kind of the one that people
always talk about, I

91
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,120
guess in the same phrase,
is bonds.

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,190
So bonds are-- essentially you
are borrowing from the public

93
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,890
markets again.

94
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,440
You are borrowing from
a bunch of people.

95
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,340
So what you do is you have,
let's say, the $6 million.

96
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,380
And it could be divided into--
you could divide this into

97
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,560
6,000 bond certificates.

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,390
So this could be 6,000 bond
certificates-- let me see, and

99
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,060
six million divided by 6,000,
that's a thousand, right?

100
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,450
So it's going to be 6,000
times $1,000 bond

101
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,700
certificates.

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,010
   

103
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,140
And let's visualize what a bond

104
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,960
certificate could look like.

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,280
So that could be a
bond certificate.

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,340
And its face value, and
sometimes they'll call it the

107
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,300
par value, or the
stated value.

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,270
It'll say-- let's call it
bond from Company XYZ.

109
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,060
And it's face value is $1,000.

110
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,490
So it's essentially-- this is
an IOU from Company XYZ.

111
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,530
If I were to hold one of these,
if I had one of these

112
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,640
sitting on my desk right now,
that tells me that Company XYZ

113
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,150
is going to pay me $1,000
at some future date.

114
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,210
And that future date
is at maturity.

115
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:17,700
So it's going to pay
$1,000 at maturity.

116
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,260
And you say oh, well, Sal,
that's all good, but what

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,970
about the interest in between?

118
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,820
And there's two ways to
think about this.

119
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Maybe they're going to pay me
$1000 in the future, but I

120
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,150
only had to give them
$500, right?

121
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,730
So, if you think about it,
there's automatically interest

122
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,800
accruing in that.

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,700
If I gave them $500 and then
five years later they pay me

124
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,990
$1000, they are essentially
paying interest, right?

125
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,020
They're paying me more back
than I gave to them.

126
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,560
And in future videos we'll
actually do the math of how to

127
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,200
figure out that type
of interest.

128
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,450
In that situation, where they're
not kind of paying me

129
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,770
interest as they go, this would
be viewed as a zero

130
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,180
coupon bond.

131
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,660
And I know I'm throwing out a
lot of terminology, but it'll

132
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,810
all make sense to you
to in a second.

133
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,910
So zero coupon essentially
means they're not paying

134
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,240
interest until they pay
off the whole loan.

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,930
And then they might kind of--
the interest will be implicit

136
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,455
in the whole value amount.

137
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,470
And I kind of jumped the
gun a little bit.

138
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,150
But coupon is essentially a
regular payment on the bond

139
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,140
that the company makes, in this
case XYZ will make, that

140
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,320
is essentially-- you can almost
view it as a kind of

141
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,740
interest.

142
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,940
But if you really had to figure
out the interest that

143
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,910
you're getting on the bond,
you'd actually have to

144
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,680
figure-- and I'll do maybe
a whole playlist on bond

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,780
mathematics-- you would have to
figure out-- It's based on

146
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,830
the coupon, what you gave them,
and then what they're

147
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,460
going to pay you, and when
they're going to do it.

148
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,190
So it's a little bit more
complicated than just saying,

149
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,970
oh, look at that, they're giving
a 6% coupon, which

150
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,210
essentially means twice a year
they're going to give me 3% of

151
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,000
the value of my bond.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,940
So just as the big
picture, both of

153
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,820
these things are traded.

154
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,110
This is a stock, it's
traded on exchange.

155
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,060
You're probably familiar that.

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,730
If you go to Yahoo!

157
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,380
Finance, you type in the ticker
symbol and you get the

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,840
price for that day.

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,270
Bonds are also traded.

160
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,470
Unfortunately, it's not as easy
to get a quote on a bond.

161
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,720
Usually you have to
have a Bloomberg

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,950
terminal of some type.

163
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,980
You can't get it on Yahoo!

164
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,370
Finance, and I think that's
by design, by bond traders

165
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,570
because they probably don't like
the transparency there.

166
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,790
But it is just like a stock.

167
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,630
It is a security.

168
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,550
It is traded.

169
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,050
There is a price.

170
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,910
But then there's a very
fundamental difference in what

171
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,050
the holder of the
bond is doing.

172
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,950
In a bond, you essentially-- if
I'm holding a $1,000 bond,

173
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,590
that means that I've
lent some amount of

174
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,440
money to the company.

175
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,380
And it'll be in this
part of it.

176
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,830
And as long as a company doesn't
go bankrupt, they'll

177
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,460
pay me some interest and
pay me my money back.

178
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,890
When I own a stock in the
company, I own a share of the

179
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,270
equity, as opposed to a share of
the debt, which is the case

180
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,550
with the bond.

181
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,180
When I own a share of the
equity, the company's not

182
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,050
promising to pay
back anything.

183
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,450
It's just saying look, you are
a part owner of this company,

184
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,780
and anything that any of the
owners get, you'll get.

185
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,390
So if this company becomes
worth a lot.

186
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,700
If we start dividending out
things to the shareholders,

187
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,570
then you'll get that.

188
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,800
If the company gets sold by
someone and pays x dollars per

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,270
share for it, you'll
get that money.

190
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,050
And if the company
goes bankrupt,

191
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,860
you'll also go bankrupt.

192
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,490
So that actually leads to an
interesting question, if the

193
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,250
company goes bankrupt--
actually, let's do the

194
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:15,940
example right now.

195
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,250
Let's say the company
goes bankrupt.

196
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,670
And I'll do a more in-depth
example of this.

197
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,670
The question is, let's say the
company goes bankrupt.

198
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,570
And people decide that it's not
operational anymore, that

199
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,660
it just can't do business.

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,590
Because there's actually two
types of bankruptcy.

201
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,980
There's one where you say, oh,
the business is good, and just

202
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,220
can't pay off it's debts.

203
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,580
So we have to somehow
restructure this side of it.

204
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,700
And then the other type of
bankruptcy is liquidation,

205
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,740
where they say, you know what?

206
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,110
This business doesn't
even make sense

207
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,220
to operate any more.

208
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,430
Let's just sell off
all of the assets.

209
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,560
So the question that I'll leave
you with in this video

210
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,000
is, what happens in a situation
where you enter

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,690
bankruptcy?

212
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,880
People want to liquidate
the assets.

213
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,190
And let's say when you liquidate
the assets, there's

214
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,720
only $8 million of assets.

215
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,650
So, the question is, who do you
think is going to eat that

216
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,590
$2 million.

217
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,470
Is it going to be the
debtholders, or the

218
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,090
stockholders?

219
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,250
Who is going to lose their money
first, or you can almost

220
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,630
say, who is more senior when it
comes to actually getting

221
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,260
their money back?

222
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,290
And I'll leave you with that,
maybe to the next video, or a

223
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,360
future video that I'll
do on bankruptcy.

224
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,610
See you in the next video.

225
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,500
