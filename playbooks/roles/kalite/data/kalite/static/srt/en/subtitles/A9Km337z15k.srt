1
00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:02,634
You have reached the first checkpoint

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:04,826
in the 'Journey to cryptography'-series.

3
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:07,675
And now I want to talk about what's next,

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:09,510
because I'm working on a new series.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,979
However, this one won't end here.

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,582
If anything, we are kind of at the beginning still.

7
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:17,718
So I'm going to do 3 different checkpoint videos.

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,254
This one is on 'Advanced Lessons'.

9
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:24,158
However, I also want to eventually talk about Tests and Challenges,

10
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:27,695
and what we can do with more interactive explorations

11
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:31,465
and computer science lessons as it applies to cryptography.

12
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,949
But for now, let's talk about Advanced Lessons.

13
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:37,194
When I say 'Advanced', I don't necessarily mean 'harder lessons',

14
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,340
I mean 'more detailed'.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,519
Let me give you a conceptual idea

16
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,688
for what I think this series could be and future series.

17
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,816
I like to think of each series as the trunk of a tree,

18
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,252
where I took you from prehistoric times

19
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,887
to around the 20th century, which is here,

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,745
with a few different threads.

21
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:59,226
And these ideas kind of branch apart.

22
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,895
Once you get to the 20th and 21st centuries,

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,598
they start getting highly specific.

24
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:09,703
And way down here on the leaves are current research questions,

25
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,338
which over here might be

26
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:13,748
problems related to prime number distribution

27
00:01:13,748 --> 00:01:18,267
and over here some very specific work being done

28
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:21,792
on randomized algorithms or hash functions,

29
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:27,187
and way up here we might have new public key protocols

30
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,523
- because RSA was just the first -

31
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,761
or we also have encryption standards such as DES and AES.

32
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,264
We would have a whole new branch on quantum cryptography.

33
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,163
So as you can see, there are so many different things

34
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:41,790
that branch out of this series

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,171
and I couldn't possibly do justice to them all.

36
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,940
So I think of this video as living right here.

37
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,777
At kind of a junction point.

38
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,613
Now I can branch off with help of the community

39
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,948
and possibly other video creators

40
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,485
to fill out this tree gradually over time.

41
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,288
Specifically with the help of the community.

42
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,491
I am really excited about the Q&A community

43
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,994
and the work being done to improve

44
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,930
how people can help people on Khan Academy.

45
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,590
So, for example,

46
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,032
in terms of where one of these branches can go,

47
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,671
I've noticed clusters of questions

48
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,441
kind of leading into a common branch.

49
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,130
For example, under 'the pseudo-random number generator',

50
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,288
I have two questions here: one by Sonny and one by Drakain.

51
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:27,490
Drakain's question is:

52
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,628
"Why has he suggested that time in milliseconds...

53
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,625
...is a suitable random seed?...

54
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,689
This is a huge no-no in security. ...

55
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,025
The time it is on your machine...

56
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:40,094
...is the time it is on my machine,...

57
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,031
...give or take 100 milliseconds...

58
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,028
(which can be brute-force attacked)"

59
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,233
And again, this is a great question too

60
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,502
because it speaks to the need that

61
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,140
I didn't present a cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator.

62
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,243
So the middle square's method is back here

63
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,847
in early 20th century, but up until today,

64
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,683
we are not using the middle square's method

65
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,753
and that's a whole interesting branch.

66
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:08,922
It is these sorts of questions which cluster together

67
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,025
and really drive new content.

68
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,595
I want to show you a really interesting example

69
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,730
of how this has happened already.

70
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,534
This is a question Samuel asked on the 'One time pad'-video

71
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,738
he said: "wouldn't a computer be able to test all the possibilities very fast?"

72
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:28,041
and Chuck Patrol basically asked the same question.

73
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,077
I see this happening a lot.

74
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,647
Similar questions all speak to the need of a new video.

75
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,418
So I went and created a video on 'perfect secrecy'

76
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,420
which really nails down

77
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,671
how you can't beat randomness in the world of encryption.

78
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:48,429
Out of this video, Dawn made a really great comment.

79
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:52,332
What they did, was basically summarise my video in two sentences.

80
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,002
So, this is what I want to try to do more of

81
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,603
in filling out these branches:

82
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,806
take questions, make new content,

83
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:03,177
and have this feed-back loop and see what we can do.

84
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,212
Now what I would really love,

85
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,130
is for you to ask questions below this video

86
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,124
which arise after watching the entire series.

87
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,688
Not specific details about certain video's,

88
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,523
- those can go with the videos -

89
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,893
but new questions, which are opening new can of worms.

90
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,296
And what I think will be fun to do, is:

91
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:26,099
Your question will lead to answers,

92
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,370
by both me and the rest of the community,

93
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,673
so we'll have multiple answers.

94
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:35,876
And what I can do is take this body of answers,

95
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:40,180
and out of this draft up a rough script

96
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,951
for more advanced videos on specific topics

97
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,020
that sub-sets of the community care about

98
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,723
So hopefully, out of the discussion below,

99
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,093
over time we can grow a bunch of new videos!

100
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,530
I want to be clear: this is an ongoing process.

101
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,099
This will not happen tomorrow or next week.

102
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,047
I hope it can happen months, even years from now.

103
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:05,506
We can still be building out new videos after the series

104
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,742
and these videos can be a collaborative effort

105
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,844
between myself and the community

106
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,889
and perhaps other video creators down the road.

107
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,780
So, let me know what you think below,

108
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:16,918
and let's get started!
