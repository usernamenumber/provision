1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,711
I have this rectangle here and I want to figure out its area.

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:08,137
I want to figure out how much space it is taking up on my screen, right over here.

3
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:13,212
And I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out the area of this entire rectangle.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:16,069
And when you do it think about the two different ways you could do it.

5
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:20,211
You either multiply the length of the rectangle times the entire width.

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,583
So just figure out the area of the entire thing.

7
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:28,004
Or you could separately figure out the area of this red or this purple rectangle

8
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,938
and then separately figure out this blue rectangle

9
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:36,136
and realize that their combined areas is the exact same thing as the entire rectangle.

10
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:41,461
So I encourage you pause the video and try both of those strategies out.

11
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,670
Let's just try them out ourselves.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,470
First, let's look at the overall dimensions of the larger rectangle.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,711
The length is 9, and we're going to multiply that times the width.

14
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,878
But what's the width here?

15
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,544
The width is going to be 8 plus 12.

16
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:01,337
This entire distance right over here is 8 plus 12.

17
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:07,961
So it's 9 times 8 plus 12.

18
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:12,269
This is one way that we could figure out the area of this entire thing.

19
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,670
This is just the length times the width.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,804
8 plus 12 is obviously going to be equal to 20.

21
00:01:17,804 --> 00:01:19,803
But the other way that we could do it,

22
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:22,738
and this must be equivalent because we're figuring out the area of the same thing,

23
00:01:22,738 --> 00:01:27,043
is to separate out the areas of these two sub-rectangles.

24
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,004
So let's do that.

25
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,378
And this must be equal to this thing.

26
00:01:29,378 --> 00:01:31,470
So what's the area of this purple rectangle?

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,212
It's going to be the length.

28
00:01:33,212 --> 00:01:40,670
It's going to be 9 times the width which is 8.

29
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,270
It's going to be 9 times 8.

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,805
And then what's the area of this blue rectangle?

31
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:53,671
That's going to be 9 times, the height here is 9 still.

32
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:54,854
The height is 9.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,094
And what's the width?

34
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,711
The width is 12.

35
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,405
And what's the area of the combined,

36
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:03,712
if you want to combine the areas of the purple rectangle and the blue one?

37
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:05,877
You just add these two things together.

38
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,738
You would just add these two things together.

39
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:11,204
And of course when you add these two things together,

40
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:12,946
you get the area of the entire thing!

41
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:16,137
So these things must be equivalent.

42
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:18,336
They are calculating the same area.

43
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,737
Now, what's neat about this is

44
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:24,419
we just kind of showed ourselves the distributive property,

45
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,470
when we're dealing with these numbers.

46
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,872
You could try these out for any numbers.

47
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:31,544
They'll work for any numbers because the distributive property works for any numbers.

48
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:35,543
You see when 9 times the sum of 8 plus 12

49
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,542
is equal to 9 times 8 plus 9 times 12.

50
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:43,543
We essentially have distributed the 9.

51
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,461
9 times 8 plus 9 times 12.

52
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:48,486
And let's actually calculate it.

53
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,269
Just to satisfy ourselves about the area.

54
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,544
If you multiply the length times the entire width.

55
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:00,629
That's 9 times 8 plus 12.

56
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:05,272
That's the same thing as 9 times 20, which is 180.

57
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:10,378
And over here if you calculate the area of this purple rectangle.

58
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,137
That is 9 times 8.

59
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:19,472
So that is going to be equal to 72.

60
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,922
That's the purple rectangle.

61
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,993
Area of the blue rectangle, 9 times 12.

62
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:27,117
That's 108.

63
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:29,082
And we're going to take the sum of the two

64
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:32,170
to find the area of the larger rectangle.

65
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,137
What is 72 plus 108?

66
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:39,138
72 plus 108 is also equal to 180.

67
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,765
So we verified, these indeed are equal to each other,

68
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,337
when we calculate them.

69
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:48,266
And they make sense because we are calculating the same exact area.
