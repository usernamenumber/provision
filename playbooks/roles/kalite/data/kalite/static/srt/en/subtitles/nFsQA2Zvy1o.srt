1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Most of us are familiar with the "=" sign.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
From our earliest days of arithmetic you might have seen something like

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1+1=2

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, a lot of people might think when they see something like this

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that somehow "=" means "give me the answer"

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"1+1" is a problem,
"=" means "give me the answer",

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and one plus one is two

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's not what "=" actually means

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"=" is actually just trying to compare two quantities.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I write

1+1=2
,

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that literally means that what I have on the left-hand side of the equal sign is the exact same quantity as what I have in the right-hand side of the equal sign.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could have just as easily had written

2=1+1

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These two things are equal.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could have written

2=2

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a completely true statement,
these two things are equal.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could have written

1+1=1+1

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could have written

1+1-1=3-2

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are both equal quantities!

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I have here on the left-hand side,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is 1

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One plus one minus one is one

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this, right over here is one.
These are both equal quantities.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, I will introduce you to other ways of comparing numbers.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The equal sign is when I have the exact same quantity on both sides.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, think about what we can do when we have different quantities on both sides.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's say I have the number 3 and I have the number 1, and I want to compare them.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, clearly, 3 and 1 are not equal.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, I can make that statement with the "not equal" (≠) sign.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I can say 3≠1 (3 does not equal 1)

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But let's say I want to figure out which one is larger and which one is smaller.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if I want to have some symbol where I can compare them,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where I can tell, where I can state which of these is larger.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the symbol for doing that is the ">" symbol.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(The "greater than" symbol)

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This would be literally read as
"3 is greater than 1"

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(3 is a larger quantity)

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you have trouble remembering what this means "greater than...",

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the larger quantity is on the opening.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I guess if you could view this as some type of an arrow,
