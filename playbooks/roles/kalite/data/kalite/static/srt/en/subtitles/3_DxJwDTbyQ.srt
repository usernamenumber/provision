1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,548
I've written some example relationships

2
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:03,772
between the two variables,

3
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:05,169
in this case between 'm' and 'n',

4
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,314
between 'a' and 'b', between 'x' and 'y',

5
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:08,847
and what I want to do in this video is

6
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:11,215
[to] see if we can identify whether the relationships

7
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:12,836
are a direct relationship,

8
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:14,280
whether they vary directlly,

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,614
or maybe they vary inversely,

10
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:17,890
or maybe it is neither.

11
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,333
So let's explore it a little bit.

12
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,199
So over here we have m/n = 1/7.

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,701
So let's see how we can manipulate this.

14
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:27,469
If we multiply both sides by 'n',

15
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,339
what are we going to get?

16
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,196
And in general, you want to separate them

17
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,114
so that the two variables are on different

18
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,246
sides of the equation,

19
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:37,082
so you can see-- is going to be the pattern--

20
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:38,333
Let me write it this way:

21
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,237
is m=kn, this would be direction variation,

22
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:43,493
or is it going to be the pattern

23
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:48,244
m = k * 1/n -- this is inverse variation.

24
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,769
And you see in either one of these,

25
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,943
they are on different sides of the equal sign.

26
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:54,112
So let's take this first relationship right now,

27
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:58,616
let's multiply both sides by 'n',

28
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,987
and you get m -- these cancel out--

29
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:04,870
is equal to 1/7 * n.

30
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,753
So this actually meets

31
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:07,271
the direct variation pattern.

32
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:09,099
It's some constant times 'n'.

33
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,503
m = some constant * n

34
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:20,337
So this right over here is direct variation.

35
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:23,540
Let's see ab = -3.

36
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,840
So if we want to separate them,

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,911
and we could do it with either variable,

38
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:30,070
let's divide both sides by 'a'.

39
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,649
We could've done it by 'b'.

40
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:33,333
If we divide both sides by 'a',

41
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,409
we get b = -3/a,

42
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,725
or, you could also write this as

43
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,976
b = -3 * 1/a.

44
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,692
And once again,

45
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:43,943
this is this pattern right here.

46
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:45,117
One variable is equal to

47
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,001
a constant times 1 over the other variable.

48
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,660
In this case, our constant is -3.

49
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,126
So over here, they vary inversely.

50
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:58,372
They vary inversely.

51
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:01,359
Let's try this one over here.

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,646
xy = 1/10

53
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:05,960
Once again, let's try to separate the variables,

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,168
isolate them on either sides of the equation,

55
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,216
and let's divide both sides by 'x'.

56
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,333
You could divide by 'y',

57
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,707
because you're really trying to find

58
00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:15,999
an inverse or direct relationship.

59
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,810
So divide both sides by 'x',

60
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,047
you get y = 1/10 over x,

61
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,321
which is the same thing as 1/10x,

62
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:27,503
which is the same thing as 1/10 * 1/x.

63
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:32,163
So y = some constant * 1/x.

64
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:39,309
Once again, 'y' and 'x' vary inversely.

65
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,769
Let's do this one over here:

66
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:48,245
9 * (1/m) = n

67
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,041
So this one's actually already done for us.

68
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,249
And it might be a little bit clearer

69
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,782
if we just flip this around.

70
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,143
If we just flip the left and the right-hand side,

71
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:57,667
we get n = 9 * 1/m.

72
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,996
n = some constant * 1/m.

73
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:06,400
So n varies inversely with m.

74
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:12,844
And, remember, if I say that n varies that m,

75
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:16,621
that also means that m varies inversely with n.

76
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:18,959
Those two things imply each other.

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,913
Now let's try it with this expression over here.

78
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:23,215
This one's a little bit of a trickier one.

79
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:24,298
Because we've already separated

80
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:25,707
the variables on both hands

81
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,238
and we have this kind of--

82
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,479
if this [were] b = 1/3 * a,

83
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,348
then we would direct variation,

84
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:34,622
and b would vary directly with a.

85
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,067
But in this case, we have 1/3 - a.

86
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:40,668
And you say, "Hey, maybe they're opposites,

87
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,168
or whatever."

88
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:41,668
And it actually turns out

89
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:45,953
that this is neither.

90
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,269
And to make that point 100% clear,

91
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,652
let's look at 2 of these examples.

92
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:52,581
In direct variation,

93
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,241
if you scale up one variable in one direction,

94
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,763
you would scale up the other variable

95
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,062
by the same amount.

96
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,347
So if x doubles from one to two,

97
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,854
when x is one, actually I should do this

98
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:06,433
with 'm' and 'n',

99
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:10,149
so m and n.

100
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,977
And the way I've written it here,

101
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,464
although you could algebraically manipulate it

102
00:04:13,464 --> 00:04:16,148
so that one looks more dependent that the other,

103
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:17,038
but in this situation

104
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:23,200
where n is 1, m is 1/7.

105
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,066
And when n is 7, m is going to be 1.

106
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,257
So you have the situation

107
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:33,271
that if n is scaled up by 7,

108
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,459
then m is also scaled up by 7.

109
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,265
Or vice versa.

110
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,548
This is more of a relationship.

111
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,640
I could've expressed n in terms of m.

112
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,517
But when you scale one variable up by 7,

113
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,847
you also have to scale up the other variable by 7.

114
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:46,347
Or if you scale it up

115
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,505
by some amount,

116
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:48,771
you have to scale up the other variable

117
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:49,901
by the same amount.

118
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:53,140
This is direct variation.

119
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,981
Let's take the inverse,

120
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:58,070
or when two variables vary inversely:

121
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,654
this situation right over here.

122
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:03,010
Let's take a and b.

123
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,898
When a = 1, b = -3.

124
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,540
Or we could do it explicitly right over here,

125
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,518
we could even go to the original one.

126
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:14,894
When a = 1, we have 1b = -3, b=-3.

127
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:19,439
If I were to take 'a', and I were to triple it,

128
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,360
so if I were to multiply it by 3,

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,031
so now a = 3, we have 1/3 * -3.

130
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:27,984
So now b = -1

131
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,275
Notice! We didn't multiply b times 3 here!

132
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:32,667
Now we divided by 3.

133
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,075
Or another way is

134
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,638
[that] we multiplied by 1/3.

135
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:42,239
So if you scale up 'a' by 3,

136
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,563
you're scaling down 'b' by 3.

137
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,651
So they're varying inversely.

138
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:48,278
What you're going to see in this 'neither'

139
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,331
is that neither of these

140
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:50,462
are going to be the case.

141
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:51,208
So let's try it out.

142
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:56,274
I'll do it in that same green color.

143
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,219
That same green.

144
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,044
So we have 'a' and 'b'.

145
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:02,318
So when 'a' is, I don't know,

146
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:04,919
when 'a' is 1, what is b?

147
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,016
1/3 - 1, that's 1/3 -3/3,

148
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,310
that's -2/3.

149
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,168
And then let's divide,

150
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:14,067
just for fun,

151
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:18,188
'a' by 3.

152
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,951
So 'a' goes to 1/3.

153
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:21,576
So we're dividing by 3,

154
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:24,313
or you could say that we're multiplying by 1/3.

155
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:25,818
So if 'a' is 1/3,

156
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,163
then 'b' is equal to 0.

157
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:32,067
If a = 1/3, b = 0.

158
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:34,423
So notice: if this [were] direction variation,

159
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:36,994
we would be multiplying this by 1/3 as well,

160
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,217
which clearly we didn't!

161
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:40,382
And if this [were] inverse variation,

162
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:41,467
if they varied inversely,

163
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,215
we would be multiplying by 3,

164
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:44,239
which clearly we didn't,

165
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,676
we just got some other number!

166
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:48,465
The scaling actually didn't matter;

167
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:49,902
what happened is that things

168
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,642
really just got shifted by some amount.

169
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:55,584
They got shifted by 2/3.

170
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:02,349
So these vary neither directly nor inversely--

171
00:07:02,349 --> 99:59:59,999
--this last one right over here.
