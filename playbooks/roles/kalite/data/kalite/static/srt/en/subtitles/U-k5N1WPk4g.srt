1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,070
Welcome to my presentation
on domain of a function.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,060
So what's is the domain?

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,720
The domain of a function,
you'll often hear it combined

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,090
with domain and range.

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,830
But the domain of a function is
just what values can I put into

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,150
a function and get
a valid output.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,360
So let's start with
something examples.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:32,880
Let's say I had f of x is equal
to, let's say, x squared.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,410
   

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,270
So let me ask you a question.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,440
What values of x can I put
in here so I get a valid

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,460
answer for x squared?

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,820
Well, I can really put anything
in here, any real number.

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:53,980
So here I'll say that the
domain is the set of x's

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,620
such that x is a member
of the real numbers.

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,020
So this is just a fancy way of
saying that OK, this r with

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,370
this kind of double backbone
here, that just means real

19
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,210
numbers, and I think you're
familiar with real numbers now.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,420
That's pretty much every number
outside of the complex numbers.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,640
And if you don't know
what complex numbers

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,910
are, that's fine.

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,980
You probably won't need
to know it right now.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,210
The real numbers are every
number that most people are

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,290
familiar with, including
irrational numbers, including

26
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,180
transcendental numbers,
including fractions -- every

27
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,470
number is a real number.

28
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,820
So the domain here is x --
x just has to be a member

29
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,730
of the real numbers.

30
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,840
And this little backwards
looking e or something, this

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,150
just means x is a member
of the real numbers.

32
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,200
So let's do another one
in a slight variation.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,445
   

34
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:51,310
So let's say I had f of x is
equal to 1 over x squared.

35
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,620
So is this same thing now?

36
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,890
Can I still put any x
value in here and get

37
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,970
a reasonable answer?

38
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,950
Well what's f of 0?

39
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:08,370
   

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,880
f of zero is equal to 1 over 0.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,870
And what's 1 over 0?

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,860
I don't know what it is,
so this is undefined.

43
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,470
   

44
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,780
No one ever took the trouble to
define what 1 over 0 should be.

45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,810
And they probably didn't do, so
some people probably thought

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,170
about what should be, but they
probably couldn't find out with

47
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,450
a good definition for 1 over
0 that's consistent with

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,250
the rest of mathematics.

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,710
So 1 over 0 stays undefined.

50
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,930
So f of 0 is undefined.

51
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,700
So we can't put 0 in and get
a valid answer for f of 0.

52
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:50,630
So here we say the domain is
equal to -- do little brackets,

53
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,900
that shows kind of the
set of what x's apply.

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,303
That's those little curly
brackets, I didn't

55
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:56,400
draw it that well.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,030
x is a member of the real
numbers still, such that

57
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,560
x does not equal 0.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,230
So here I just made a slight
variation on what I had before.

59
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,925
Before we said when f of x is
equal to x squared that x

60
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,050
is just any real number.

61
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,250
Now we're saying that x is any
real number except for 0.

62
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,400
This is just a fancy way of
saying it, and then these curly

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,290
brackets just mean a set.

64
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,390
Let's do a couple more ones.

65
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:44,360
Let's say f of x is equal to
the square root of x minus 3.

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,170
So up here we said, well this
function isn't defined when we

67
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,680
get a 0 in the denominator.

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,090
But what's interesting
about this function?

69
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,600
Can we take a square root
of a negative number?

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Well until we learn about
imaginary and complex

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,030
numbers we can't.

72
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,280
So here we say well, any x is
valid here except for the x's

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,220
that make this expression under
the radical sign negative.

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,510
So we have to say that x minus
3 has to be greater than or

75
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,690
equal to 0, right, because you
could have the square to 0,

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,235
that's fine, it's just 0.

77
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:20,070
So x minus 3 has to be greater
than or equal to 0, so x has to

78
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,700
be greater than or equal to 3.

79
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:35,130
So here our domain is x is a
member of the real numbers,

80
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,165
such that x is greater
than or equal to 3.

81
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:45,840
   

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,140
Let's do a slightly
more difficult one.

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:05:01,260
What if I said f of x is equal
to the square root of the

84
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,200
absolute value of x minus 3.

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,320
So now it's getting a little
bit more complicated.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,020
Well just like this time
around, this expression of

87
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,180
the radical still has to be
greater than or equal to 0.

88
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,400
So you can just say that the
absolute value of x minus 3 is

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,910
greater than or equal to 0.

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,580
So we have the absolute value
of x has to be greater

91
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,830
than or equal to 3.

92
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,480
And if order for the absolute
value of something to be

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,440
greater than or equal to
something, then that means that

94
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:46,290
x has to be less than or equal
to negative 3, or x has to be

95
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,530
greater than or equal to 3.

96
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,460
It makes sense because x
can't be negative 2, right?

97
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,240
Because negative 2 has an
absolute value less than 3.

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,700
So x has to be less
than negative 3.

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,930
It has to be further in the
negative direction than

100
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,220
negative 3, or it has to be
further in the positive

101
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,790
direction than positive 3.

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,490
So, once again, x has to be
less than negative 3 or x

103
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,000
has to be greater than 3,
so we have our domain.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,920
So we have it as x is
a member of the reals

105
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,960
-- I always forget.

106
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,460
Is that the line?

107
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,080
I forget, it's either
a colon or a line.

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,510
I'm rusty, it's been
years since I've done

109
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,400
this kind of stuff.

110
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,050
But anyway, I think
you get the point.

111
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,800
It could be any real number
here, as long as x is less

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,650
than negative 3, less than or
equal to negative 3, or x is

113
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,980
greater than or equal to 3.

114
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,650
Let me ask a question now.

115
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:50,970
What if instead of this it was
-- that was the denominator,

116
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,270
this is all a separate
problem up here.

117
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,500
So now we have 1 over the
square root of the absolute

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,160
value of x minus 3.

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,730
So now how does this
change the situation?

120
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,650
So not only does this
expression in the denominator,

121
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,170
not only does this have to be
greater than or equal to

122
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,360
0, can it be 0 anymore?

123
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Well no, because then you would
get the square root of 0, which

124
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,560
is 0 and you would get a
0 in the denominator.

125
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,310
So it's kind of like
this problem plus this

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,600
problem combined.

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,210
So now when you have 1 over the
square root of the absolute

128
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,430
value of x minus 3, now it's no
longer greater than or equal to

129
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,690
0, it's just a greater
than 0, right?

130
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,420
it's just greater than 0.

131
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,040
Because we can't have a 0
here in the denominator.

132
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,080
So if it's greater than 0, then
we just say greater than 3.

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,510
And essentially just get rid of
the equal signs right here.

134
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,790
Let me erase it properly.

135
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,310
   

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,750
It's a slightly different
color, but maybe

137
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,640
you won't notice.

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,130
So there you go.

139
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,450
Actually, we should do another
example since we have time.

140
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:58,470
   

141
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,180
Let me erase this.

142
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,810
OK.

143
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:35,140
Now let's say that f of x is
equal to 2, if x is even,

144
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:53,970
and 1 over x minus 2 times
x minus 1, if x is odd.

145
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,970
So what's the domain here?

146
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,620
What is a valid x I
can put in here.

147
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,820
So immediately we
have two clauses.

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:13,270
If x is even we use this
clause, so f of 4 -- well,

149
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,030
that's just equal to 2 because
we used this clause here.

150
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,300
But this clause applies
when x is odd.

151
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,370
Just like we did in the last
example, what are the

152
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,270
situations where this
kind of breaks down?

153
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,200
Well, when the
denominator is 0.

154
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,850
Well the denominator is 0
when x is equal to 2, or

155
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,870
x is equal to 1, right?

156
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,970
But this clause only
applies when x is odd.

157
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,350
So x is equal to 2 won't
apply to this clause.

158
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,370
So only x is equal to 1
would apply to this clause.

159
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,010
So the domain is x is a member
of the reals, such that

160
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,320
x does not equal 1.

161
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,160
I think that's all the
time I have for now.

162
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,210
Have fun practicing
these domain problems.

163
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,491
