1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,750
You've probably heard that the
top speed of some type of

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,060
aircraft is Mach 2.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,070
Or maybe you've watched some
type of science fiction movie,

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,465
or some type of fighter movie,
where they say, hey we are

6
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:21,050
going to travel at Mach 1.8.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,480
And you had a sense, because
they're using it in the same

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,680
context that you would use
as speed, that this is

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,660
some type of speed.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,350
That these numbers represent
some type of speed.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,750
And if you assume that,
you were right.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,340
And the speeds they represent
are actually a multiple, or

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,340
depending on how you want
to view it, multiples or

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,880
fractions of the speed of
sound in that medium.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,050
So if someone tells you that
the Mach number is 2, what

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:56,570
that tells you is that they are
traveling two times the

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:07,340
speed of sound, in that medium,
for those conditions.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,460
And I make those last two
qualifiers on it because the

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,840
speed of sound is not
always the same.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,100
It has a different speed
depending on whether it's

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,430
traveling in air, or water, or
even depending on what makes

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,910
up the air.

23
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,600
And even if it is only traveling
in a certain type of

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,050
air, or a certain makeup, a
mix of gases, it'll also

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,960
change depending on
the temperature.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,050
So if you're at sea level, at
roughly about 20 degrees

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,270
Celsius, the speed of sound is
300, so sea level-- do a

28
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,230
different color, maybe blue for
sea level-- so if you're

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,960
at sea level, the speed
of sound is about

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,070
340 meters per second.

31
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,080
This is at 20 degrees Celsius,
so it's a nice comfortable

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:03,820
temperature at sea level, which
is roughly about 760

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,800
miles per hour.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,240
Now if the temperature were to
drop, so if temperature goes

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,220
down, so does the
speed of sound.

36
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,170
   

37
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,520
And likewise, if the temperature
goes up, the speed

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,870
of sound goes up.

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,580
So when someone tells you that
something is traveling at Mach

40
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,320
2, they're saying its traveling
at two times the

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,660
speed of sound for
that medium.

42
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,250
Usually they're talking
about something

43
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,380
traveling through air.

44
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,300
And for the speed of sound at
the temperature that they're

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,720
going through.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,250
So if they're at some super-high
altitude, and

47
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,230
normally to travel at these
types of speeds, you have to

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,300
be at a fairly high altitude
where the air is less dense.

49
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,270
You're also traveling in an
environment where the

50
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,240
temperature is significantly
lower than 20 degrees Celsius.

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,100
So you might say, hey, does
that mean if someone's

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,090
traveling at Mach 2, does that
mean that they're definitely

53
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,560
traveling at 680 meters
per second, or at

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,440
1520 miles per hour?

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,160
And of course, whenever someone
gives an air speed,

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,270
it's relative to the air.

57
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,310
And the answer is no.

58
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,180
They're probably going to be
traveling a little bit slower

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,270
than that, because at the
altitude that they're

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,580
traveling the speed
of sound is lower.

61
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,980
Now there are ground speed
records where they are

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,860
traveling in kind of the Mach
range where their velocities

63
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,070
are high enough to say
it in terms of Mach.

64
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,400
And for those types of
situations, they are traveling

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,400
at multiples of 760 miles per
hour, 340 meters per second.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,280
Now you're probably saying, hey,
who is this person right

67
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,780
here that I've cut and pasted
from Wikipedia?

68
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,240
And this Ernst Mach.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,330
And this is who the Mach
number is named after.

70
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,440
Ernst Mach, and he was this
Austrian physicist and

71
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,214
philosopher.

72
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:57,780
He did a ton of research
on shockwaves and

73
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,060
soundwaves, and whatnot.

74
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,360
So the Mach number is
named after him.

75
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,866
