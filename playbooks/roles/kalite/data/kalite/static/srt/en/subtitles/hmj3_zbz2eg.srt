1
00:00:01,161 --> 00:00:03,533
what i want to do now is just a series of problems

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,828
that really makes sure that we know what

3
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:09,267
we are doing with parallel lines and triangles

4
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,000
and all the rest. And what we have right here is

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,745
a fairly classic problem. And what I want to do is

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,933
I want to figure out just given the information here

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,760
so obviously I have a triangle here I have another

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,006
triangle over here we were given some of the angles inside of these triangles. Given the information

9
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:30,133
over here I want to figure out what the measure of this angle is

10
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:35,533
right over there I want to figure out what that question mark is. And so you might want to give a go

11
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:42,267
at it just knowing what you know about the sums of the measures of the angles inside of a triangle and

12
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:46,867
maybe a bit of what you know about supplementary angles so you might want to pause it and give it a try

13
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:53,333
yourself since I'm about to give you the solution. So the first thing you might say and this is a general

14
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,467
way to think about these problems where they give you some angles and you have to figure out other angles

15
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:02,508
based on sum of angles in a triangle equaling 180, or this one doesn't have parallel lines but you might

16
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:08,133
see one with parallel lines and supplementary lines and complementary lines is to just fill in every

17
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:14,067
thing that you can figure out and one way or antoher you can probably figure out what this question mark

18
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:19,087
is. So the first thing that pops out to me is that we have one triangle right over here, we have this

19
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:25,200
triangle on the left, and on this triangle on the left we are given two of the angles. And if you have

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,267
two of the angles in a triangle you can always figure out the third angle because they are always going t

21
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:40,426
o add up to 180 degrees. So if you call that 'X' we know that 'X' plus 50 + 64 is going to be equal

22
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:52,083
to 180 degrees. Or we could say X plus 114 is equal to 180 degrees, we can subtract 114 from both sides

23
00:01:52,083 --> 00:02:03,867
of this equation and we get 'x' is equal to 180 minus 114 so 80 minus 14, 80 minus 10 is 70 minus another

24
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:13,933
4 is 66. So x is 66 degrees now if x is 66 degrees you might find that there is another angle that is

25
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:26,843
not too hard to figure out. So let me write it like this, so x, is equal to 66 degrees. Well if we

26
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:30,733
know this angle right over here, if we know the measure of this angle is 66 degrees. We know that that

27
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:38,200
angle is supplementary with this angle over here, there outer sides form a straight angle and they are

28
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:47,021
adjacent. So if we call this angle right over here y we know that y plus x is going to be equal to 180

29
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:56,100
degrees and we know x is equal to 66 degrees, so this is 66 so we can subtract 66 from both sides and

30
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:06,085
we get y is equal to 180-66 is 114 and that number n=might look a little familiar to you. notice this

31
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:12,933
114 is the exact same sum as these two angles over here. And thats actually a general idea and ill do i

32
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:19,761
t on the side here just to prove it too you. if i have lets say these two angles lets say the measure

33
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:25,267
of that angle is a, of that angle is b, the angle of this measure we know is going to be 180 minus a

34
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:32,333
minus b, thats this angle right over here. And then this angle which is considered to be an exterier

35
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:39,000
angle, so in this example y is an exterior angle in this example that is our exterior angle that is going

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,667
to be supplementary to 180 minus a mius b so this angle plus 180-a-b is going to be equal to 180 so if

37
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:59,514
you call this angle y you are going to have y plus 180 -a -b is equal to 180 you can subtract 180 from

38
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:07,757
both side you can add a and b to both sides so +a +b +a +b I'm running out of space on the right hand

39
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:13,200
side. and then you are left with - these cancel out - on the left hand side you are left with y on t

40
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,088
he right hand side is equal to a plus b. so this is just a general property. you can you can just reason

41
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:25,067
it through yourself just with the sum of the measures of a inside of of an the angles of an inside of

42
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:29,746
a triangle add up to 180 degrees and then you have the supplementary angles right over here or you van

43
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:37,733
just say look if I have the exterior angles right over here it is equal to the sum of the remote interior

44
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:43,400
angles thats just a little terminology you'd see there so y is equal to a +b , 114 degree we've already

45
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,867
shown to ourselves is equal to 64 + 50 degrees, anyways regardless of how we did it if we just reason i

46
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:55,867
t out step by step or if we just knew this property from the get go if we know that y = 114 degrees and

47
00:04:55,867 --> 00:05:02,092
I like to reason it out every time just to make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions. So if y is 114

48
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:07,467
degrees. we know this angle we know, we were given this angle at the beginning know we just have to

49
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:13,353
figure out this third angle in this triangle. so if we call this z, if we call this question mark is

50
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:26,000
equal to z we know that z + 114 +31 is equal to 180 degrees. the sums of the measures of the angle i

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,418
side of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, that is the only property that we are using at this step.

52
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:44,607
So we get z plus what is this 145 145 = 180, did I do that right if I we have a 15 and a 30 yep 145 is

53
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:55,533
equal to 180. subtract 145 from both sides of this equation and we are left with z = 80 - 45 is equal
