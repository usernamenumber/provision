1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:02,692
Rewrite the expression below

2
00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:04,699
applying the commutative

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,153
and associative properties of addition,

4
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:09,404
and then show that both expressions yield

5
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:12,130
the same result.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,538
So, one, we could just

7
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:15,023
evaluate the expression the way

8
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:16,279
that it is written, then

9
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:17,363
we could mess around with it using the

10
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:19,900
commutative and associative properties of addition.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,010
So lets first add 17.5 plus 3

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,697
so that's going to give us

13
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:28,770
20.5, so this is

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,189
going to be 20.5.

15
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:35,085
And to then to that we're going to add negative 7.5.

16
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:39,451
Now adding -7.5 is the exact same thing

17
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:42,492
as subtracting 7.5.

18
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,791
so this is going to be equal to -

19
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,680
the .5s cancel out -

20
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:51,187
and then 20 minus 7 is 13.

21
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:53,754
So that's our first way of getting the answer

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:56,175
and we kind of adhere to the parentheses.

23
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:58,542
Now let's use the commuatative property.

24
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,477
The commutative property tells us that the order doesn't matter;

25
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,547
we can commute these numbers around,

26
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:04,752
they can move (commute).

27
00:01:04,752 --> 00:01:06,300
It's like you're going to work.

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,989
They can move around. So lets just move the numbers around.

29
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:10,684
Let's make it, let's make it, actually

30
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,937
we could do all sorts of crazy things.

31
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,745
We could make it, one we could

32
00:01:14,745 --> 00:01:16,498
just change the order here.

33
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:25,901
We could make this -7.5 plus 17.5 plus 3.

34
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,469
We could keep the parentheses, just like that,

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,114
so we would have essentially just changed the order of this expression,

36
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:36,200
but let's use the commutative and the associaive property.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,615
So now we've commuted everything around,

38
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,612
and now we can reassociate everything.

39
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:42,377
So instead of putting the parentheses like that,

40
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:45,480
we could put the parentheses like that.

41
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:47,764
So that's what the associate property tells us.

42
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:49,621
Let me write this down.

43
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:53,636
So associative property of addition

44
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:58,770
tells us that (a+b)+c where you do a+b first

45
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,881
is the same as a+(b+c) where you do b+c first.

46
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:19,638
The commutative property

47
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:24,284
tells us that a + b = b + a

48
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,680
that you can move these guys around.

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,027
So let's evaluate this one.

50
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:31,066
We actually got here using both the commutative and the associative property,

51
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:37,129
so we get -7.5 + 17.5.

52
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:39,126
This is the exact same thing as

53
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,424
17.5 -7.5.

54
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,792
It might be easier for you to realize,

55
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:49,436
"Okay, I'm adding two numbers of different signs, so

56
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,712
what I could do is take the difference between the two,

57
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:53,616
and since the larger number is positive,

58
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:54,777
I have a larger number.

59
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:58,770
Or you could just do this as 17.5 - 7.5."

60
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,092
So 17.5 - 7.5,

61
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:04,622
the .5s cancel out. 17 - 7 is 10.

62
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:05,876
So this part right here

63
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:11,356
becomes 10. And we still have the plus three there

64
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:14,374
and that once again that is going to be

65
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:17,950
equal to 13. And we could keep commuting this around and

66
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,343
keep reassociating it

67
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:23,000
and no matter how we do it, we are going to get 13.
