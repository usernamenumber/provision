00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,952
Comedian Steven Wright, and I guess we can credit him with being a bit of a philosoper

2
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:10,616
once commented that "Black holes are where God divided by zero"

3
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:14,557
and I won't get in to the physics of it, and obviously the metaphor breaks down in certain ways

4
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:18,284
But it is strangely appropriate, because black holes

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:22,667
are where are current understanding of physics seems to break down

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:29,995
and dividing by zero, as simple an idea as that seems to be, is where our mathematics also breaks down

7
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:33,687
This is "undefined"

8
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:38,374
Sometimes when you see 'undefined' in math class it seems like a very bizarre idea

9
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,407
But it really means exactly what the word means

10
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:47,566
Mathematicians have never said what it means to divide by zero, what is that value?

11
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:50,845
And the reason they haven't done it is because they couldn't come up with a good answer

12
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:56,671
There's no good answer here, no good definition!

13
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:01,412
And because of that, any non-zero number, divided by zero, is left just 'undefined'

14
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:06,469
Seven divided by zero, eight divided by zero

15
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:12,076
Negative one divided by zero, we say all of these things are just 'undefined'

16
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:17,221
You might say "well, if we can just define it we can atleast try to come up with a definition

17
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,896
of what it means to take a non-zero number divided by zero"

18
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,636
So let's do that right now

19
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:26,812
We'll take the simplest of all non-zero numbers, we'll just take one

20
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,799
(but we could have done this with any non-zero number)

21
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,934
Since we don't know what it means to divide by zero

22
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:38,015
Lets just try a really really small positive number

23
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:43,330
Let's see what happens as we get close to zero

24
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,135
So lets divide by 0.1

25
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:49,878
Well, this will get us to ten

26
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:55,549
If we divide one by 0.01 that gets us to 100

27
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:05,018
If I go really really close to zero, if I divide one by 0.000001

28
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:13,933
This is one divided by a millionth

29
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,333
That's going to give us 1 million!

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:22,721
So we see a pattern here, if we divide one by smaller and smaller positive numbers

31
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:25,936
We get a larger and larger value

32
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:31,673
Based on just this you might say "Well, hey, I've got somewhat of a definition for one divided by zero

33
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:36,630
Maybe we can say that one divided by zero is positive infinity!"

34
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,652
As we get smaller and smaller positive numbers here we get super super large numbers right over here!"

35
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:48,727
But then, your friend might say "Well, that worked when we divided by positive numbers close to zero

36
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:52,043
but what happens when we divide by negative numbers close to zero?"

37
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:54,023
So lets try those out

38
00:02:54,023 --> 00:03:00,092
Well one divided by negative 0.1, that's going to be negative ten.

39
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:07,458
One divided by negative 0.01, that's going to be negative one-hundred.

40
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:16,767
And, if we go all the way to 1 divided by negative 0.000001

41
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:20,395
That gets us to negative 1 million

42
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:27,547
So you if we keep dividing one by negative numbers that are closer and closer to zero

43
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,093
We get a very different answer!

44
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,203
We actually start approaching negative infinity!

45
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:36,547
So over here we said it would be positive infinity, but you can make an equaly strong argument

46
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:39,127
that it could be a very different number!

47
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:46,326
Negative infinity is going the exact opposite direction

48
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,876
And this is why mathematicians say there's just no good answer here

49
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:53,288
Especially one that's consistent with the rest of mathematics

50
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:56,300
They could have just said it was equal to 42 or something like that

51
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,391
But that would make no sense!

52
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:03,050
Its neither one of these values, and it wouldn't be consistent with everything else we know

53
00:04:03,050 --> 99:59:59,999
So they just left the whole thing 'undefined'
