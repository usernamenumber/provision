1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,620
Let's say we have two
entrepreneurs.

3
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,700
And they are both interested
in buying a pizzeria and

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,480
eventually turning it into
a public company.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,640
So let's compare the two.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,630
So let me draw a dividing line
here between the first and the

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,260
second entrepreneurs.

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,460
And they're actually going
to buy identical assets.

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,140
So they're going to buy
a pizzeria with the

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,460
ovens inside of them.

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,250
And the same amount of cash
in the cash register.

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,980
Everything they need to operate
the pizzeria and they

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,550
may be in identical locations.

14
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,790
Maybe right next to each other
at the same intersection.

15
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,220
Or across the street
from each other.

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,400
It's the same asset.

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,270
Let me draw that out.

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,830
I don't want to draw this box.

19
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,620
So that's the asset.

20
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,410
And it costs $100,000.

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,910
That includes the building.

22
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,160
It includes the oven.

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,420
It includes the places where
the customers come sit.

24
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,870
It even includes
the cash needed

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,190
to operate the business.

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,800
So you need some cash to pay
vendors just to get started

27
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,540
and to pay for things
like dough.

28
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,270
And have some money in
the cash register.

29
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,250
And to have a little bit
of a bank account.

30
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:01,890
Things like that.

31
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,130
So that's all inclusive.

32
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:09,100
All of the assets needed to
start the firm, the pizzeria.

33
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,820
So this is the assets.

34
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,100
And they both buy identical
assets.

35
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,350
So let me copy and paste that.

36
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,050
   

37
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,870
They buy identical assets.

38
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,720
Now, the first entrepreneur,
he's very conservative and

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,930
he's been saving all his
whole life to do this.

40
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,840
So he actually has $100,000 of
cash to buy his pizzeria, so

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,010
he buys it outright.

42
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,115
So he owns it outright so all of
the $100,000 of asset value

43
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:38,060
is actually his equity.

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,875
Let me do equity in
a different color.

45
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,690
It's all his equity.

46
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,040
So that's all his equity.

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,060
This guy here, maybe he's a
little bit earlier in his

48
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,170
career, or he's just not as
good at saving money.

49
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,040
So he doesn't quite
have $100,000.

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,190
He actually only has $10,000
in his pocket.

51
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,450
But he's a smooth talker.

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,480
So he goes to the local bank
and says, hey I have this

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,350
great idea for-- let me write
this down, $10,000 of equity,

54
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,590
that's what he has-- but he
tells the guy at the bank, and

55
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,676
he buys him lunch, and he says,
I have this great idea

56
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,080
for a pizzeria.

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,630
And they agree to give
him not just $90,000.

58
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,160
This guy, he's a little
ambitious too.

59
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,160
He thinks not just beside
a pizzeria.

60
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,970
In the name of the pizzeria
he's going to borrow some

61
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,110
money and then maybe invest that
in stocks or something.

62
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,780
So he gets a sweetheart
deal on the loan.

63
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,970
And he's able to actually borrow
a little bit more than

64
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,760
what he even needs.

65
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,530
He only needs $90,000, but let's
say he borrows $100,000.

66
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,140
So he borrows $100,000
of debt.

67
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:49,710
   

68
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,490
And so, he has $110,000
to play with.

69
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,280
He buys a $100,000 pizzeria.

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,150
And then he has another $10,000
left over to do with

71
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,800
what he wants.

72
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,460
And he puts it in the pizzeria's
name, in the

73
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,100
pizzeria's bank account.

74
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,800
Because he has to show the bank
that it's going towards

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,090
the pizzeria.

76
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,570
But his real intent is to maybe
gamble with it on the

77
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,110
side in the pizzeria's name, and
maybe invest in stocks or

78
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,600
speculate on pork
belly futures or

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,340
something like that.

80
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,600
But for all intents and
purposes it's cash.

81
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,460
And so they go off and they
start their pizzeria.

82
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,140
Let's see what happens.

83
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,570
So let's look at them over
the course of one year.

84
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,820
So let's say, revenue.

85
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,290
   

86
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,490
So let's say the first year
they're identical.

87
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,150
They both make $100,000
in revenue.

88
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,760
   

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,890
Let's say their cost of goods
sold is roughly 50% of that.

90
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,340
So it's $50,000.

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,020
I'll put a minus there because
it's an expense.

92
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,910
Minus $50,000.

93
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:06,770
So both of their gross
profit is $50,000.

94
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,510
And then their SG&A
is the same.

95
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,140
If you've watched the video on
depreciation and amortization,

96
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,510
this might even include the
depreciation on some of the

97
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,279
physical assets they've
bought, or maybe the

98
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,850
amortization on the rights to
the name Super Pizzeria.

99
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,540
In either case.

100
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,730
Maybe the brands
are identical.

101
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,010
So that's another $20,000.

102
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,350
Minus $20,000.

103
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,790
So far they look very,
very identical.

104
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,000
And that's because they have
the same exact asset.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,250
So their operating profit.

106
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,280
   

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,780
50 minus 20 is $30,000.

108
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,020
And now we'll start to see
a little difference.

109
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,210
And this goes back to the
very first video we saw.

110
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,480
It says if you have an identical
asset and it's being

111
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,060
managed identically, which it
is in this case, they will

112
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,700
generate an identical amount
of operating profit.

113
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,660
But when I talk about the asset,
I'm talking about only

114
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,570
the operating assets.

115
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,600
This guy has some non-operating
assets, although

116
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,690
it's officially part
of the company.

117
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,100
He doesn't need it to operate.

118
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,330
This is cash above
and beyond what's

119
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,740
needed in the cash register.

120
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,530
And we might have a little bit
of cash here in this asset

121
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,410
that's needed for the
cash register.

122
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,980
And I'll teach you more
about working capital.

123
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,370
But in order to pay vendors
and things like this.

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,480
This is cash above and beyond
what's necessary.

125
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,525
This guy has a little
bit of cash just

126
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,650
to operate the business.

127
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,310
He just doesn't have this
gambling cash out here.

128
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,830
So now we add an interesting
line.

129
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,120
Non-operating income.

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,730
   

131
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,850
This guy doesn't
make anything.

132
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,150
He's not gambling.

133
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,090
This guy's pretty good
with this $10,000

134
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,320
of speculation cash.

135
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,300
He makes, say, 20% on it
in this first year.

136
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,060
So he makes $2,000.

137
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,120
And then we have interest
expense.

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
This guy has no debt.

139
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,610
Very prudent.

140
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:04,240
He has no interest. So his
pre-tax income is $30,000.

141
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,210
This guy, he does have interest.
And let's say on

142
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,580
that $100,000 of debt, he
got a really good deal.

143
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,930
Let's say that the Fed thought
that he was systemically

144
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,390
important to the future of
our financial system.

145
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,290
So he gave him a sweetheart 2%
debt deal, because he was

146
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,570
afraid that if this pizzeria
were to fail, it would bring

147
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,930
down the entire financial
system.

148
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,810
So given that 2% on
$100,000 debt.

149
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,190
That's $2,000 of debt a year.

150
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,840
So minus $2,000.

151
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
I'll make it a little
bit more realistic.

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,740
   

153
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,990
Let's say it's 5%.

154
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,360
   

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,330
So 5% on $100,000 is $5,000
per year in interest. So

156
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,440
that's his interest expense.

157
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,910
Let me write that.

158
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,490
This was interest. This
was non-op income.

159
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,690
This was operating profit.

160
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,320
You just have to carry
the lines over.

161
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,330
And so his pre-tax income
is now 30 plus

162
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,620
2 minus 5 is $27,000.

163
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,010
They both pay 30% in taxes.

164
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,090
And so this guy's
paying $10,000.

165
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,460
Well, actually, $9,000
would be 30%.

166
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,330
And this guy, 30% of 27.

167
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:24,720
So let's see.

168
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,570
Taxes.

169
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,710
3, 6,000 plus-- 8,100.

170
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,970
Minus $8,100.

171
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,250
Is that right?

172
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,540
Yeah.

173
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,820
That's $9,000.

174
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,490
And then if you have $3,000
less, you should be $900 less.

175
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,610
Yep, that's right.

176
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,780
And so, we're finally at
the net income line.

177
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,710
   

178
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,880
This guy makes $21,000.

179
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,390
This guy makes-- what is this?

180
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:58,140
This is $18,900 net income.

181
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,150
And of course the difference
is the money that he had to

182
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,900
spend on tax.

183
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,420
On interest expense.

184
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,120
If you net out all of his little
financial engineering,

185
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,290
he had to pay $3,000 more in
interest, if you net out his

186
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,080
profit he made on his little
cash bets, his side bets.

187
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,000
And that was able to
be a tax deduction.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,420
So the actual effect ends
up being $2,100.

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,020
Which is essentially $3,000
of a 30% tax rate.

190
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,280
So, fair enough.

191
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,350
That's not what I
want to do here.

192
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:30,790
I don't want to focus too much
on the tax savings on

193
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,559
interest. What I want to do here
is focus on valuation and

194
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,520
see whether the price to
earnings ratio holds up to

195
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,669
scrutiny in this situation,
where you have an identical

196
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,950
asset but very different
capital structures.

197
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,640
So let's say they both
have 10,000 shares.

198
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,070
I'll arbitrarily switch colors.

199
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,380
10,000.

200
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,150
So EPS.

201
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,960
This guy made $21,000
this year.

202
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,480
Divided by 10,000 shares
is $2.10 per share.

203
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,080
This guy, $18,900 divided by
$10,000 is $1.89 per share.

204
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,450
And we could have modeled
out their

205
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,460
income statements further.

206
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,360
And actually, this guy, even if
the top line, even if the

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,900
revenue grew the same and the
operating profit grew the

208
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,260
same, because of his leverage
he would actually grow a

209
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,980
little bit faster.

210
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,380
I'll do another video on how
that works with leverage.

211
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,090
But let's say that someone looks
at this and says, OK,

212
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,780
it's the same business
and everything.

213
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,250
And if anything, this guy's
growing a little bit faster

214
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,350
because he's got that leverage,
that extra juice

215
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,630
from the financials, from the
capital structure he's got.

216
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,060
So they both deserve at least
a price to earnings of 10.

217
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,330
So you say, they both deserve
a price to earnings of 10.

218
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,090
So 10 price to earnings.

219
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,340
You'd say, I'm willing to
pay $21 for this guy.

220
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,410
And I'm willing to pay
$18.90 for this guy.

221
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,860
Now what does that result in
their valuation, or in terms

222
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,670
of their market cap?

223
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,050
So in this guy's case,
market cap.

224
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,850
$21 times 21,000 times 10,000
shares, means that you are

225
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:11,630
ascribing a-- 21 times 10--
you're saying that the equity

226
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,330
in this company is
worth $210,000.

227
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,320
In this case, you're saying
that the equity in this

228
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,850
company is worth $189,000.

229
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,600
So this one's worth a little bit
more, because it's earning

230
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,170
a little bit more money.

231
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,290
Although I don't want to
complicate it, but you might

232
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,310
be willing to pay a higher
multiple here.

233
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,400
So something very interesting
is happening.

234
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,980
By applying the same price to
earnings, we're saying that

235
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,990
the market value of this equity
is $210,000, while the

236
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:56,590
market value of this equity is--
what was it?-- $189,000.

237
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,710
Something doesn't seem
to make sense.

238
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,740
This guy put up $100,000,
and sure, they invested

239
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,620
it and did all that.

240
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,650
So now the market's willing to
say, hey, you know what?

241
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,160
This is a pretty profitable
business, more profitable than

242
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,900
most. You're making
good margins.

243
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,580
And I'll do a bunch of videos
on margins in the future.

244
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,720
We're willing to say that
the market value of

245
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,020
your equity is $210,000.

246
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,030
Which implicitly means that the
market value of this asset

247
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,230
is $210,000.

248
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,340
They're saying, this
is worth $210,000.

249
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,810
That's because this must
be worth $210,000.

250
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,140
But if you look here, by giving
the same price to

251
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,990
earnings, because they're
the same business.

252
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,750
And maybe this guy's even
growing faster, so maybe

253
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,060
they're being conservative by
only giving this guy a 10

254
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,190
price to earnings.

255
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,590
You get a $189,000 market
cap for this equity.

256
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,880
Which, all of a sudden, this guy
only put in $10,000, and

257
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,490
people are saying it's
worth $189,000?

258
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,740
And if this little fraction
right here is $189,000, then

259
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,890
it implies what about
this asset?

260
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,600
What does it imply about the
value of that asset?

261
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,990
You have $189,000 as the
value of this equity.

262
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,320
The value of this debt
is $100,000.

263
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,070
So the market is saying, the
right-hand side of the balance

264
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,870
sheet is what?

265
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,780
It's $189,000 plus $100,000.

266
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,125
It's $289,000.

267
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,845
And let's say this cash
is still cash.

268
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,270
It's worth $10,000.

269
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,340
So if you subtract it out, the
market is saying, this is

270
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,380
$289,000 minus this
$10,000, $279,000.

271
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,960
So something is very
bizarre right here.

272
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,490
That the market-- just because
of how this guy has

273
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,780
capitalized his company--
if they just apprised a

274
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,540
superficial price to earnings of
10 to both companies, it's

275
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,080
willing to say that this asset
is worth $279,000, and this

276
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,970
asset's only worth $210,000,
even though

277
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,190
they're identical assets!

278
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,983
So I've already used more than
enough time on this video, so

279
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,290
I'll let you ponder
that a little bit.

280
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,220
In the next video, I'll show you
that the reason why this

281
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,590
is kind of breaking down is
because a price to earnings

282
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,790
ratio does break down to a
certain degree when you start

283
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,580
comparing things with different
capital structures.

284
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,590
And in the next video, I'll
introduce you to other ways of

285
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,900
comparing things with a
different capital structures,

286
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,730
or essentially deleveraging
them.

287
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,620
That when you just talk about
price to earnings or market

288
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,820
capitalization-- when you
just looked at market

289
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,030
capitalization, it looked OK.

290
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,150
Oh, they're similar
businesses.

291
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,490
This one's worth a little
bit more because

292
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,880
this one has debt.

293
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,270
But when you actually back out
the implicit value of the

294
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,150
asset, all of a sudden you
realize that you're really

295
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,960
overpaying for this asset.

296
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,340
So think about that
a little bit.

297
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,810
What's the conundrum here?

298
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,830
What went wrong?

299
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,300
And in the next video I'll
give you some tools to

300
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,470
actually do this right.
