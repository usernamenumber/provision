1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:03,345
We're on problem 51.

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:08,004
And they say, a diagram from
the proof or from a proof of the Pythagorean theorem is pictured below.

3
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:10,802
And they said, they say, which
statement would not

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,321
be used in the proof of the Pythagorean
theorem?

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,072
So since they have drawn this
diagram out, I think we might as well just

6
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:19,370
kind of do the proof and then we can look at their choices

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,620
and see which
ones kind of match up to what we did.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,121
Hopefully, hopefully, they do
it the same way.

9
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,479
So this, this is a pretty
neat proof

10
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:29,260
of the Pythagorean, Pythagorean theorem. I don't think I've
done it yet. So I might as well do it now.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,130
So, the way they've drawn it the big inside here is,

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,141
Well, let's figure out
what the area

13
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:36,420
of this large square is...

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,526
Right? Well there's two ways to think
about it

15
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:40,032
You could just say, "OK, this is a square."

16
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,545
That's (a), that's (b).

17
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:44,099
Well this is going
to be (b) as well.

18
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,377
This is going to be (a) as well.

19
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,363
So the area of the square is
going to be the

20
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,588
length of one of its sides squared...

21
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,141
...right? So

22
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,313
we could say (a) plus (b), the whole square's area,

23
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:54,823
is (a) plus (b) squared.

24
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:59,842
..(a) plus (b)...

25
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:07,645
...squared, and that's equal to (a) squared
plus 2ab plus (b) squared.

26
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:09,687
Fair enough.

27
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:12,281
Now we can also say that the
area of this larger square,

28
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,131
that's bit of an optical
illusion, looks like it's

29
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,561
tilted to the left because
of the way it's drawn. But anyway,

30
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,144
that the area of
this larger square is also

31
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:22,932
the area of these four triangles,
plus the area of

32
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:25,821
this smaller square.

33
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:29,879
So this, the area of the
larger square, which we figured out just by taking the...

34
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,364
taking one
side of it and squaring it, that should be equal to the area

35
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:34,928
of the four

36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,101
smaller triangles, so there's four of them.

37
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:39,865
And what's the area
of each of them?

38
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,451
Let's see it's 1/2 base, lets just pick this one.

39
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:45,073
1/2 base times height. So it's 1/2

40
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,457
times (a) times (b).

41
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:54,886
So it's 1/2 ab. So 1/2 ab is one of these and
I multiplied it by 4 to get all four of these

42
00:01:54,886 --> 00:01:57,767
triangles.

43
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:01,214
And then we want to add the area
of this inside, this inside square.

44
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:03,957
That's just going
to be (c) squared, right? this side is (c), that side is (c),

45
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,947
So plus (c) squared.

46
00:02:07,947 --> 00:02:10,476
Now let's see if we can
simplify this.

47
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:19,902
So, you get (a) squared plus 2ab
plus (b) squared is equal to 4

48
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:24,688
times 1/2 is 2ab
plus c squared.

49
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:29,131
Well, we could subtract
2ab from both sides of this equation, right?

50
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:32,189
I, I worked at the top and the bottom of
this equation the way I've written it.

51
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:38,147
But if we do that, you get subtract 2ab
from there, subtract 2ab from there, and you're left with

52
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:41,332
(a) squared plus (b) squared

53
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:44,382
is equal to (c) squared, which
is the Pythagorean theorem.

54
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:46,838
We've proved it.

55
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:50,291
So let's see which of their
choices matches what we did.

56
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,501
OK, which statement would not
be used in the proof

57
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,255
of the Pythagorean theorem?

58
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,244
The area of a triangle
equals 1/2 ab.

59
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,448
No, we used that;

60
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:03,359
we have to use that. The four right triangles are congruent.

61
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:05,011
No, we used that.

62
00:03:05,011 --> 00:03:07,910
The area of the inner square

63
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,870
is equal to half of the area of the larger square.

64
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,539
No, we didn't use that. I think this is the one that

65
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:16,226
would not be used in the proof. Let's see

66
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,959
choice D, the area of the larger
square is equal to

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,382
the sum of the squares of the
smaller square

68
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:24,630
and the four congruent triangles. No, that's, that was the crux of the, of the proof. So we definitely used that. So C is our answer. That's

69
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,479
the statement
that would not be

70
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,118
used in the proof.

71
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:32,918
and I'm,

72
00:03:32,918 --> 00:03:35,671
I'm learning to copy and
paste ahead of time.

73
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:37,474
So I don't waste your time.

74
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:40,206
Alright, a right triangle's
hypotenuse has length 5.

75
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,786
If one leg has length 2,
what is the length of the other leg?

76
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:50,580
ok, so this is, so its 5, 2, and they wanna know the other leg,

77
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,318
Pythagorean theorem, x squared
plus 2 squared is equal to 5 squared

78
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:58,799
because 5 is
the hypotenuse.

79
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,360
x squared plus 4
is equal to

80
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,927
25, subtract 4 from both sides.

81
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:08,276
x squared is equal to 21.

82
00:04:08,276 --> 00:04:11,870
So x is equal to the
square root of 21.

83
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,311
So choice B.

84
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,072
Next question.

85
00:04:17,072 --> 00:04:18,866
A new pipeline is being
constructed to reroute oil flow

86
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:27,184
around the exterior of a
national wildlife preserve.

87
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,919
I guess that's the national
wildlife preserve.

88
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,232
The plan showing the old
pipeline and the new route

89
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,381
is shown below.

90
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:39,942
OK, how many extra miles will
the oil flow once the new route

91
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,140
is establised. So the new route

92
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,397
is going to
be 60 miles plus 32 miles. So the new route

93
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:48,191
is 92 miles.

94
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:56,306
So what was the old route? Well the old route was the hypotenuse of this triangle, right?

95
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,937
So we could say, 60, let's
call that x.

96
00:04:58,937 --> 00:05:03,386
60 squared plus 32 squared
is equal to x squared.

97
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:13,077
Because that's the hypotenuse.

98
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:16,107
And these numbers, that's a bit
of a pain to, uh,

99
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:23,626
to deal with. Maybe if I can factor out
something here I can make it more interesting. So I don't have to multiply out

100
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:28,107
60 squared and 32 squared, and

101
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:33,632
all of the rest.
Well, let me let me just, see if i can .

102
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,243
if I factored out

103
00:05:35,243 --> 00:05:38,032
Both of those are
divisible by 4.

104
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:41,836
right? both of those are divisible by 4

105
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:44,392
So then I would have 15 and 8.

106
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:47,171
Yeah, that still doesn't
make it that useful.

107
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:50,243
So I'll just multiply
them out. So this is 3600.

108
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:54,605
At 32 squared, let's
see, 32 times 32.

109
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:58,867
2 times 32 is 64.

110
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:02,191
3 times 2 is 6.

111
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,802
3 times 3 is 9.

112
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:09,547
So it's 1024.

113
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:13,096
Plus 1024 is equal
to x squared.

114
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:15,754
So let me just switch
both sides.

115
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:18,842
x squared is equal to 3600
plus 1024 is 4624.

116
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:25,941
Let me see if I can get
an approximate.

117
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,417
lets see, twenty times,

118
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:31,001
So x is going to be the square
root of this thing right here.

119
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:33,932
So let's see if I can get
a handle at least on

120
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:36,661
the magnitude of where
this would be.

121
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:45,481
So 20 times 20 is 400. So this is way too small.

122
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:49,457
60 times 60 is 3600.

123
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:52,123
So 68 times 68, this
looks right. Especially because 8 times 8 should end in a 4. Let me try that out.

124
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:58,038
68 times 68.

125
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,446
8 times 8 is 64.

126
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:04,194
8 times 6 is 48 plus 6 is 54.

127
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:10,537
6 times 8, 48.

128
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:14,105
6 times 6, 36 plus 4 is 40.

129
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:19,031
4624....right,

130
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,139
So x is 68. So x is equal to 68.

131
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,255
Oh, you know what? I used 68, I shouldn't have.
Because they don't want

132
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:31,455
to know how long was
the old pipeline.

133
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:33,645
That's 68.

134
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:37,288
It just happened to be
one of the choices. That's just to

135
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,994
make
sure that you read the question properly.

136
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:41,184
But they want to know how
much longer

137
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:42,601
is going to be the new pipeline, right?

138
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,529
So the new one was 92.

139
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,420
And the old one is 68.

140
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,673
Good thing they had that
number there so I could try it out.

141
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,798
That was the square
root of 4624.

142
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:52,801
So how much longer
is the new one?

143
00:07:52,801 --> 00:08:06,041
Well 92 minus 68, that's
24 miles, right? Yeah, 24. So choice A.

144
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,246
Not choice B. B is how long the old
pipeline was.

145
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:13,148
We want to know how much longer
the new route is.

146
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,416
That was tricky.

147
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,940
Well not tricky, but I kind of
fell for it by

148
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,778
forgetting what the question was about.

149
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,464
Anyway, next question.

150
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:26,503
Marcia is using a straightedge
and compass to do the construction below.

151
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:28,441
Interesting.

152
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,682
Which best describes the
construction Marcia is doing.

153
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:34,169
So, I assume when they
say construction

154
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,692
she's drawing something.

155
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:39,097
Let's see what it looks like. It looks she's taking her compass,

156
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:41,223
she's probably putting one of the points here,

157
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:44,011
she put one of the points there and then she
kind of drew this arc.

158
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:47,290
And then it looks like she put
the point there

159
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,833
and then she drew that arc.

160
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,847
And then she put the point
here and drew that arc.

161
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:58,293
And then put the point there
and drew that arc.

162
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:03,453
And the end result, it seems
like the reason why she picked this point here is it

163
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:06,001
goes through this line L.

164
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:08,441
So she's probably trying to find
another point here,

165
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,985
so that she can draw
another line. Because they say she
has a straightedge. A straightedge is to
draw these lines. A compass is to draw
these curves.

166
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:17,495
So if she were to draw another
line between these two points,

167
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:27,370
if, you know, it looks something like
that, then she would have

168
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,076
parallel lines.

169
00:09:29,076 --> 00:09:33,979
The reason why she would have
parallel lines is because these would be corresponding
angles, and they would be congruent.

170
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:36,599
And so if you have a transversal, 
the corresponding angles are congruent, you're
dealing with parallel lines.

171
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:41,734
So my read of this question is
that she's probably trying to draw

172
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:44,533
a line that is
parallel to L.

173
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:54,060
A line through P parallel
to line L. Yeah!

174
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,443
That's what I think
she's trying to do.

175
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,806
All right, choice A.

176
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,170
55.

177
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,547
Given angle A.

178
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,992
So given this angle.

179
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:04,454
What is the first step in
constructing the angle

180
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:09,993
bisector of angle A?

181
00:10:09,993 --> 00:10:14,469
what is the first step constructing angle bisector

182
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:20,299
OK, this is, well actually I've
never done this.

183
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:22,939
But I can assume that
if I have a compass. You know what a compass is,
it has those two points.

184
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,510
One of them is like
a pivot point.

185
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,509
It looks something like this.

186
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,353
It looks like it has a little
pivot point, and then on the other side,

187
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:34,445
you can stick
your pencil.

188
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:37,870
And you can adjust it up here.

189
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,095
And the bottom line, you pivot
around this and then you can draw circles,

190
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,692
of arbitrary
radiuses. right?

191
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:46,955
It seems like that's
what they did here.

192
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:49,534
So if I want to draw the angle
bisector of (a)

193
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:52,181
just thinking about it, it seems I could put
the pivot point here,

194
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:57,928
and then I can put the pencil and
I can draw this circle. And really,

195
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:02,896
as long as I just
find the two points that it intersects those two lines
or those two rays,

196
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:07,973
then I'll be fine. And I could have done
it anywhere. I could have done it here.

197
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:10,740
I could have done it out here. They just picked
points B and C.

198
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,321
And then from each of those
points

199
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,961
you can put your pivot here.

200
00:11:15,961 --> 00:11:18,423
If you put your pivot here, and
then you were to draw

201
00:11:18,423 --> 00:11:20,506
a circle around that, you
would have gotten this one right here.

202
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:26,874
And then if you were to put your
pivot point right here, draw a circle, you would
be able to draw that.

203
00:11:26,874 --> 00:11:31,737
And then where they intersect,
that would that would give you

204
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,316
that would give you an indication of where the
angle bisector is.

205
00:11:34,316 --> 00:11:36,810
And you could then draw that
line to where they intersect.

206
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,839
So let's see, they say what is
the first step in constructing the angle bisector of angle (a).

207
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,635
So they say draw ray AD.

208
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,402
Well that seems like that
would be the last step. Then you're done.

209
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,656
Draw AD, that is the
angle biector.

210
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:54,201
Draw a line segment connecting
points B and C.

211
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:58,054
No, that's useless.

212
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:00,083
You don't need a line segment.

213
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,105
I mean even what they have
drawn, that's an arc.

214
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,233
It's not a line.

215
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,341
From points B and C, draw
equal arcs that intersect at D.

216
00:12:07,341 --> 00:12:09,656
That was the second step.

217
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:12,032
You have to have points B and
C before you can draw those equal arcs.

218
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:16,026
From point A, draw an arc that
intersects the side of the angle

219
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,912
at points B and C.

220
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,485
Yeah, that's what we said. That was the first step. Put your pivot here,

221
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:25,536
and use
your pencil to draw the arc. You say OK, this point
and this point.

222
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,307
So that would be
the first step.

223
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:29,999
D.

224
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,163
And I'm all out of problems
and I'm out of time.

225
00:12:33,163 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.
