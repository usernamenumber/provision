00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:03,048
I want to do a quick correction to the AIME problem

2
00:00:03,048 --> 00:00:06,432
where we cut out a wedge of a log in that problem.

3
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:07,825
So we had a wedge

4
00:00:07,825 --> 00:00:10,887
so just to remind ourselves that we had a log

5
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:13,145
and it looked like that

6
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:14,916
we made one cut that was right along

7
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,139
that was perpendicular to the axis of the log

8
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:18,039
and we made another cut

9
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,421
that had a 45 degree angle.

10
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:22,082
So it was like that.

11
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:23,549
And the solution to the problem

12
00:00:23,549 --> 00:00:25,104
we had to figure out the volume of the wedge

13
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:26,564
and the big trick there was

14
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:28,723
if I drew the wedge like this

15
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:30,395
so let me take a side view of the wedge.

16
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:34,148
So this is the side of the wedge right over here.

17
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:37,314
I could shade it to show that it's kind of round.

18
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:38,401
So if I were to shade it

19
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,824
you could kind of see that it is round.

20
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:41,687
So this is a side view of the wedge.

21
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:44,517
We knew that this right here is a 45 degree angle.

22
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:45,813
And the way that we solved the problem

23
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,420
or the kind of trick was to say

24
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,892
Hey, if we had another wedge like this

25
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:50,644
and we just stacked it on top of this one

26
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:53,714
if we just flipped it over and made it like this

27
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:57,655
then we also have a 45 degree angle over here

28
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:58,719
and it would make a cylinder

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,694
and it's very easy

30
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,549
to figure out the height of a cylinder.

31
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,219
And I misspoke when I said it was lucky

32
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,060
that we had a 45 degree angle.

33
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,274
Because in the last video

34
00:01:07,274 --> 00:01:09,335
I was actually visualizing it incorrectly.

35
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,147
Because I said if you had anything

36
00:01:10,147 --> 00:01:11,926
less than a 45 degree angle

37
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:13,553
this wouldn't have worked out properly

38
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:14,406
But I was wrong!

39
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,136
It would have worked out properly.

40
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,485
Let me show you.

41
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:22,640
So this, let's just say whatever angle you have here.

42
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,590
So this is going to be 90 degrees over here.

43
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,005
Whatever angle you have over here

44
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:27,980
so let's call that theta

45
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,198
this over here, they have to add up to 180.

46
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:33,364
So theta plus 90 plus this has to be 180

47
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:36,569
Or theta plus this has to be 90

48
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,315
or you could just call this 90 minus theta.

49
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:43,600
Now, if I were to take the same thing

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,267
if I took another kind of wedge like this

51
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,252
and flipped it over this thing

52
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:50,048
it's not this angle that's going to be right here

53
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,093
it's this angle.

54
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,539
Let me just draw it over here.

55
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:57,723
It would look like this.

56
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,194
Where this now is theta.

57
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,324
This end right here

58
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:03,038
is actually that end on the flipped version.

59
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:04,757
And now this angle right over here

60
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,942
is now 90 minus theta.

61
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:09,674
So clearly you have 90 minus theta plus theta.

62
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,902
So this thing is going to be a right angle

63
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,934
no matter what.

64
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,826
Obviously it has to be a reasonable angle

65
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,526
but no matter

66
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:18,203
assuming that its less than 90 degrees

67
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,260
it would have worked out.

68
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,523
You could have done the same trick.

69
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:21,821
Anyway, hopefully that clarifies it

70
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:22,495
and I apologize

71
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:26,329
for the incorrect visualization in the last video.
