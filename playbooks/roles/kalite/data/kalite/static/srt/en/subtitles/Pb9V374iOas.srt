1
00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:05,298
We're asked to simplify log base 5 of x to the third

2
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,964
and once again we're just going to rewrite this in a different way

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,549
you could argue whether's going to be more simple or not

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,736
and the logarithm property that I'm guessing we should use for

5
00:00:15,736 --> 00:00:17,470
this example right here is

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,298
the property if I take log base x

7
00:00:22,298 --> 00:00:25,603
of, of, let me fix more letters here

8
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:29,736
of log base x of y to the zth power

9
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:33,471
that this is the same thing as z times

10
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:37,137
log base x of y

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:40,548
so this is the logarithm property. If I'm taking the logarithm of a given base

12
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:43,805
of something to the power, I could take that power upfront

13
00:00:43,805 --> 00:00:48,937
and multiply that times the log of the base of

14
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:52,805
just the y in this case. So we apply this property over here

15
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:57,632
and the second once I do this problem I'll talk about why this actually makes a lot of sense

16
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:01,005
it comes straight out of exponent properties. If we just apply

17
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,737
that over here we get log base 5 of x to the

18
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:07,938
third. Well this is the exponent right over here. It's the same thing

19
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:11,271
as z so that's going to be the same this as

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,938
that three is the same thing. We could put it out front

21
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:19,049
that's the same thing as three times the logarithm

22
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,069
base five of x. And we're done this is just

23
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:27,048
another way of writing it using this property so you can argue this is a

24
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:31,964
maybe this is a simplification because you took the exponent outside of the logarithm and you're multiplying

25
00:01:31,964 --> 00:01:38,537
the logarithm by that number now. Now that out of the way, lets think about why that actually makes sense.

26
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:50,797
So lets say that we know that "a" to the "b" power is equal to "c"

27
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:54,405
and so if we know that, that's written as an exponential equation, if we want to write

28
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,963
the same truth as a logarithmic equation

29
00:01:57,963 --> 00:02:04,004
we would say, "logarithm base 'a' of 'c' is equal to 'b'"

30
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,548
To what power do I have to raise 'a' to get 'c'?

31
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:08,548
I raise it to the bth power

32
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:12,548
'a' to the 'b' power is equal to 'c'. Fair enough.

33
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:22,131
So lets take both sides of the equation over here and raise it to the 'dth' power.

34
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,871
Instead of doing in place I'm just going to rewrite it over here.

35
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:30,670
So I wrote the original equation, 'a' to the 'b' is equal to 'c', which is just rewriting the statement.

36
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,131
So let me just take both sides of this to the dth power and I should be consistent

37
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,881
I'll use all capital letters so this should be a 'b'

38
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:45,871
actually I'm using all lower cases so this is a lower case 'c'

39
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:51,070
I'm going to raise this to the dth power and I'm going to raise this to the dth power.

40
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,136
Obviously these two are equal to each other if I raise both sides to the same power

41
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,669
The equality is still going to hold.

42
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:02,964
Now, what's over here

43
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:07,631
is we can use what we know about exponent properties

44
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,547
Say if I have 'a' to the bth power, then I raise that to the dth power

45
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:14,962
our exponent properties say that this is the same thing

46
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:24,881
this is equal to 'a' to the b*d power

47
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:32,738
this right over here using what we know about exponent properties

48
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:39,138
this is equal to 'a' to the b<i>d power. So we have 'a' to the b</i>d power

49
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:42,214
so we have a to the b<i>d power this is equal to c to the b</i>d power

50
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:46,010
Now this exponential equation, if we write it as a logarithmic equation

51
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:55,138
we would say, log base 'a' of 'c' to the dth power

52
00:03:55,138 --> 00:04:00,670
is equal to b*d. What power do I have to raise 'a' to

53
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,404
to get to 'c' to the dth power? To get to this I have to raise it to the b*d power.

54
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:12,804
But what do we know that 'b' is? We already know that 'b' is this thing right over here.

55
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:18,046
So if we substitute this in for 'b' and we can write this as b*d

56
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:29,137
we get logarithm base 'a' c to the dth power is equal to b<i>d or you can also call that d</i>b

57
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:34,004
and so that's equal to d times b, be is just

58
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:38,880
log base 'a' of 'c'

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,213
So there you have it we just derived this property

60
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:46,405
log base 'a' of c to the dth, that's the same thing as d times log base 'a' of c

61
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:49,000
which we applied right over here.
