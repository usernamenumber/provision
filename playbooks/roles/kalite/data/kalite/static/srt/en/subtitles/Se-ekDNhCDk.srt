1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,960
We've got a few more molecular
structures to name, so let's

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,980
look at this first
one right here.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,840
The first thing you always want
to do is identify the

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,730
longest chain.

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,030
If we start over here, we have
one, two, three, four, five,

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,260
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,050
carbons, looks pretty long.

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,040
Now what if we start
over here?

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,240
This looks like it could also
be a long chain: one, two,

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,900
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven,

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,600
twelve, thirteen.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,180
So we have two different chains,
depending on whether

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,730
we want to go up here or whether
we go over here, that

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,520
have a length of thirteen.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,340
So you're probably asking, which
chain do you choose?

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,360
You should always, if we have
two chains of equal lengths

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,860
and they're the longest chains,
you pick the one that

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,690
will have more branches or
more alkyl groups on it.

19
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:56,250
So this group right here, if we
pick this from here to here

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,560
as our chain, we only have
one group on it,

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,830
that group up there.

22
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,970
If we pick this chain, starting
over here and then

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,550
going over here, we have
two groups on it.

24
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,250
We would have this group over
here and then we would have

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,140
this group over here.

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,540
This is the better chain
to use because it has

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,730
more groups on it.

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,110
It has more groups,
but the groups

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,100
are smaller and simpler.

30
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,550
So let's start counting.

31
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,010
And the direction we want to
count, we always want to start

32
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,980
on the side of the chain where
we're going to encounter

33
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,060
something first, and everything
is closer this end

34
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,090
of the chain so we'll
start counting here.

35
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:45,530
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:50,870
eleven, twelve, thirteen, so
we have thirteen carbons on

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,650
our main chain.

38
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,880
Let me draw our main chain.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,830
So our main chain is this thing
in orange I'm drawing

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,320
right here.

41
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,640
That is our main chain.

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,220
Thirteen, that's
three and ten.

43
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,380
The prefix is tridec- and it's
tridecane because we have all

44
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,960
single bonds here, so
it's tridecane.

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Tridecane is the main chain.

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Then we have two groups
over here.

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,650
This one in green, this only has
one the carbon branching

48
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,070
off of the main chain, so it's
prefix will be meth- and it'll

49
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,310
be a methyl group, so
that is methyl.

50
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,560
That is a methyl group
right there.

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,980
Then this one down here, we have
one, two, three carbons.

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,200
the prefix is prop-, so this
is a propyl group.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,990
   

54
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,660
And the methyl is sitting on the
three carbon of our main

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,920
chain and the propyl group is
sitting on the four carbon:

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,590
one, two, three, four.

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,370
Now when we figure out what
order to list them in when we

58
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,830
actually write out the name,
M, we just do it in

59
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,270
alphabetical order.

60
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,720
M comes before P, so we write 3-methyl before 4-propyl.

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,540
The entire compound here is
or the entire molecule is

62
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:33,540
3-methyl-4-propyltridecane And
this is actually all going to

63
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,520
be one word.

64
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,250
You use dashes to separate when
you have numbers, but if

65
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,860
you have a word followed by
a word, it just becomes

66
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,530
propyltridecane, so
3-methyl-4-propyltridecane.

67
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,530
And we're done.

68
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,710
Let's do this one down here.

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,090
Now this one seems a little
bit more complex.

70
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,510
The first thing to see is what
is the largest chain or

71
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,280
the largest ring that we have
in our structure?

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,910
The two candidates, we have
this chain over here.

73
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,030
This has one, two, three, four,

74
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,590
five, six, seven carbons.

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,930
Let's see how many carbons
our ring has.

76
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:13,140
Our ring has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,190
nine carbons.

78
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,290
So the ring is the largest
core structure in this

79
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,390
molecule, so that will be
our core structure.

80
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,200
We have nine carbons-- let me
highlight it-- so the ring is

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,896
this right here.

82
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:30,620
It has nine carbons.

83
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,260
The prefix for nine is non-.

84
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,290
It's all single bonds, so it's
nonane, and it is in a cycle.

85
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,420
It's a ring, so it's
cyclononane.

86
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,070
This part right here, that
part right there, is

87
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,320
cyclononane.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,850
   

89
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,970
We have several things that
branch off of the cyclononane,

90
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,010
so let's look at them one at a
time, and then we'll think

91
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,070
about how we're going to number
them on the ring.

92
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,090
We looked already at this at
this chain that has seven

93
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:10,520
carbons: one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

94
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,150
So that is a heptyl group.

95
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,100
   

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,650
This over here, let's see
what we're dealing with.

97
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,570
We have one, two, three carbons,
so that is just a

98
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,170
standard propyl group.

99
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,450
   

100
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:37,540
Then here, we have one, two,
three, four carbons, so we

101
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,410
could say this is
a butyl group.

102
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,960
But this isn't just
any butyl group.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,360
If we use the common naming,
the carbon we immediately

104
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,760
touch on or that we immediately
get to when we go

105
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,030
off of our main ring, that
branches off into three other

106
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,000
carbons, so this is tert-,
tert- for three.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,620
The tert- is usually
written in italics.

108
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,140
It's hard to differentiate
that when you see it.

109
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,470
I'll write it in cursive.

110
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,810
This is tert.

111
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,260
This is a tertbutyl group.

112
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,090
Now, the next question is how
do we specify where these

113
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,070
different groups sit
on this main ring?

114
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,500
If you just had one group, you
wouldn't have to specify it,

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,930
but when you have more than one,
what you actually do is

116
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,900
you figure out which one would
be alphabetically first, and

117
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,990
that would be number one.

118
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,860
Now, we have an H in heptyl, a
P in propyl, and tert-butyl,

119
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,250
you might say, well, do I use
the T or do I use the B?

120
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,770
And this is just the convention,
you use the B.

121
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,790
If you have sec-butyl or
tert-butyl, you ignore the

122
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,980
sec- or the tert-.

123
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,190
If this was an isobutyl or an
isopropyl, you actually would

124
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,200
use the I, so it's a little
bit-- I guess the best way to

125
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
think about it is there's a dash
here so you can kind of

126
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,990
ignore it, but if this was
isobutyl it would all be one

127
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,940
word, so you would
consider the I.

128
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,830
So in this situation, we would
consider the B, and B comes

129
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,200
before P or an H, so that
is where we will

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,410
start numbering one.

131
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,580
Then to figure out which
direction to keep numbering

132
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,360
in, we just go in the direction
where we're likely

133
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
to encounter the first or where
we will encounter the

134
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,180
first side chain, so we'll go
in this direction because we

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,240
get right to the propyl group.

136
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:19,440
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,180
So this compound, we're going
to start with the

138
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,430
alphabetically first side chain,
so it's 1-tert-butyl.

139
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:33,040
   

140
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,290
I'll write this in cursive.

141
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,860
   

142
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,100
1-tert-butyl.

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,490
Then the next one
alphabetically

144
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,810
is the heptyl group.

145
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,680
That's H for heptyl, so
then it is 5-heptyl.

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,790
   

147
00:07:51,790 --> 00:08:00,520
And then we have the propyl, and
then it is 2-propyl, and

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:10,120
then finally cyclononane,
and we're done!
