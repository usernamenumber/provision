1
00:00:00,555 --> 00:00:03,212
This right here is a picture of Carl Linnaeus,

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,037
and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing the word.

3
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:07,715
And he's a Swedish gentleman who lived in the 1700's.

4
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:12,126
And he's known as the Father of Modern Taxonomy.

5
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,544
And the word taxonomy,

6
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,403
if you just split it up into it's original root,

7
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:17,770
it really is the science of really classifying things.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,924
But when people talk about taxonomy,

9
00:00:19,924 --> 00:00:21,824
in this particular in Carl Linnaeus' case,

10
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:24,514
they're talking about the classification of living things.

11
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:29,462
So, classifying... classifying, organisms.

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:32,169
And his real innovation, before he came about,

13
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,521
people realized that you had species of animals

14
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:37,584
that lions had certain properties that made them all lions,

15
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:39,612
and they could interbreed and things like that

16
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:41,856
monkey or chimpanzees would all interbreed

17
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:43,312
and that would be a separate species

18
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,951
and that polar bears were a separate species,

19
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,379
and that humans were a separate species.

20
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,033
But what he really brought to the table, is he decided,

21
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,654
well "Let me just not just group animals into species,

22
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:55,551
maybe I can group species into, into other categories

23
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:58,015
and that's where we get the genus from...

24
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,370
You group similar species into a genus.

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,717
And then he went even beyond that,

26
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:04,284
because even the idea of grouping things into a genus

27
00:01:04,284 --> 00:01:06,746
dated back to the Ancient Greeks.

28
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:09,177
He said, "Well, why don't I group similar genuses together,

29
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,945
into orders, orders together into classes,

30
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,390
and then classes together into kingdoms.

31
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,088
So, really, what he did is, he said,

32
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:18,950
Well, maybe I can classify, I can create a tree.

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,193
I can create a tree of life.

34
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:22,104
I can create a structure so we can really see

35
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:24,981
how far apart any two organisms are.

36
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,750
And that's really why he's the Father of Modern Taxonomy.

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,535
And he did not have many tools.

38
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:31,966
All he could do was look at the powers,

39
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,202
his powers of observation.

40
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:34,640
He said: OK, those kinds of animals,

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,915
they have fur, or they reproduce in this way,

42
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:39,141
or they lay eggs, or they don't lay eggs,

43
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,331
or they have spinal columns,

44
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,542
or they don't have spinal columns.

45
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:42,995
So that's the best that he could do,

46
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:44,634
when he did his taxonomy.

47
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:47,866
But since then, there's obviously been tons of innovations

48
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,304
and how we perceive animals

49
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:53,433
or the natural world, and our tools for studying them.

50
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,315
So one thing that he did not know about is evolution.

51
00:01:57,315 --> 00:02:00,708
This idea of common ancestry

52
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,614
and between our understandings of evolution

53
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,842
and our ability to look back at the fossil record,

54
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,748
that helps us get more precise at figuring out

55
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,465
which animals are related to which.

56
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:12,231
We can see: do they have a common ancestor,

57
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,059
more recent, or further back?

58
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,580
And what even Charles Darwin didn't have,

59
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,226
which we now use as a tool in taxonomy,

60
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,456
is the genetic evidence.

61
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:23,949
So now we don't even have to rely on the fossil record,

62
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,547
we can look at the DNA of two species that exist today

63
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,007
and see how similar is the DNA,

64
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:32,303
and that tells us how recently they branched apart

65
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:35,010
if we were able to find it in the fossil record

66
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,600
or how recently in the past

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,777
did these two species become two different species.

68
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:42,868
Now with that said, I do want to make this clear.

69
00:02:42,868 --> 00:02:45,189
This is something, you know, I always have a little bit

70
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:48,629
It was fuzzy to me the first time I was exploring the idea of taxonomy.

71
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,730
It's that taxonomy is as much an art as it's a science.

72
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,235
Today, even to these days people are debating about

73
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,829
the best way to classify things.

74
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,668
And what you're pay attention to

75
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,403
and DNA has been the best tool so far

76
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:05,071
in giving us a more systematic, a more analytic way

77
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:07,854
of deciding how close two animals are,

78
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,653
but to a large degree a lot of these categories.

79
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:12,188
Deciding where to divide along

80
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:14,471
kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, tribe

81
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,259
these're somewhat arbitrary

82
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,891
these're just based on early taxonomists, including Carl Linnaeus

83
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,853
and saying "Oh this looks like a grouping right over here."

84
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:24,855
But they could have grouped on a broader level or at a deeper level

85
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:29,154
so this things right over here are somewhat arbitrary. Aaah...

86
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:30,749
A more analytic way is just to see

87
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:32,187
how much DNA you have in common

88
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,593
and then you just use that as a measure of

89
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,906
how far apart two animals are.

90
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,920
Or really I should say two species are,

91
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,297
because this taxonomy doesn't know

92
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:41,829
it doesn't apply just to animals,

93
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:44,288
it applies to plants and bacteria,

94
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:47,605
and Archaea and all sorts of things,

95
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,949
so it's actually a broader thing that just animals.

96
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:51,078
Now with that out of the way

97
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:52,111
what I'd thought would be fun

98
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,566
just so that we could really get a sense of

99
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,314
where modern taxonomy is,

100
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:58,750
where the field that was essentially fathered by Carl Linnaeus,

101
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,818
where it is now?

102
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,177
how we,... And use that to figure out

103
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:04,884
where we humans fit into the big picture.

104
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:06,990
And obviously I'm drawing

105
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,528
just a small fraction of the universe of the organisms

106
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:12,174
that we even know about right now,

107
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:13,813
but at least it frames the picture

108
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,361
in terms of something we understand,

109
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:18,998
in particular: us, in particular humans.

110
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:21,166
Now our species, we call ourselves humans,

111
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,799
but we are really Homo sapiens

112
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,720
and the sapiens is the species part

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,164
and then Homo is the genus.

114
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,912
What I'm doing right over here is I'm saying:

115
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,444
Well, if Homo is the genus,

116
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:35,001
what other species were inside of Homo?

117
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,845
and the reality is, or as least as far as we know,

118
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,539
there are no living species inside of Homo

119
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,549
that we've probably killed them all of

120
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,522
or did or maybe we interbred with them somehow.

121
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:47,089
which might have argued that

122
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:48,448
maybe they weren't different species,

123
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:51,311
but more likely they were competing in the same ecosystems,

124
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,048
and they became endangered species very quickly

125
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,460
when they competed with our ancestors,

126
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,443
but the most recent other species within the genus

127
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:01,947
that we know about are the Neanderthals

128
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:04,888
and the formal word, the formal, the formal term

129
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,011
for their species is Neanderthalensis.

130
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:12,318
Now if we go further up the tree of life, further up the taxonomy,

131
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:15,069
and you'll sometimes see tribe dimension, sometimes you won't,

132
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:17,717
and we tend to get a little more granular

133
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,016
the closer we get to humans

134
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,669
when we go further away in the tree of life

135
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,448
we get a little bit less granular sometimes,

136
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,196
but that's not always the case, as well.

137
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:27,258
You go a little bit further up and you get to Hominini,

138
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,974
and I'm sure I am mispronouncing some of this, as well,

139
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:33,970
but another species that is in Hominini that is not in Homo,

140
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,656
and I'm definitely not listing all of them

141
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:37,516
and that's why I'm showing all of these other branches,

142
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:39,480
all of these other branches over here,

143
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,361
is what we call the common chimpanzee

144
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,383
and their species name is, their genus is Pan

145
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:48,607
and their species is Troglodytes.

146
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:51,858
So you'd refer to them as Pan troglodytes.

147
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,279
And that's also another convention

148
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,688
that Carl Linnaeus came up with,

149
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,185
is that you refer to a particular species by its genus

150
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:00,663
and then its species, and you capitalize the genus

151
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:01,969
and you lower-case the species.

152
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,362
We are Homo sapiens, this is Homo neanderthalensis,

153
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:07,092
this is Pan troglodytes,

154
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,832
or often referred to as chimpanzees.

155
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:13,380
Now, if you go up one higher level of broadness

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,886
on this tree of life, you then get to the family

157
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:21,427
and we are in the family Hominidae, Hominidae

158
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,269
and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it once again.

159
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,500
But just to give you an example,

160
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,865
so everything I listed so far,

161
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,687
everything I've talked about so far are within this family.

162
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,392
And to show you an animal that is not in this family

163
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,188
you just have to look at the gorilla.

164
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:36,699
And you could call it the Gorillini, the Gorillini

165
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:40,181
Gorillini gorilla, or G. gorilla,

166
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:42,270
that's its actual species name.

167
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,081
And this family right over here

168
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,063
sometimes the common term is the great apes,

169
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,969
the great apes.

170
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,649
Now you go one further level, and this is;

171
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,141
the whole reason why I'm doing this,

172
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:54,438
and I am not by any means,

173
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:58,232
am I being exhaustive about the other species

174
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:01,762
that are in that family but that are not in our tribe,

175
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm just trying to get a picture of,

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,893
as we get further and further out,

177
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:07,446
as we get further out of our tribe, our family, our order,

178
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:11,052
we're getting to things where the common ancestor with human

179
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,909
goes further and further back in time,

180
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:15,999
the genetic similarities become more and more different,

181
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,525
and even just the physical differences

182
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,434
if we look at it in a very superficial level,

183
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,982
become more, and more, and more different.

184
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:23,718
So you get to even a broader category,

185
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:25,633
this is where you get to the primates

186
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,656
and this is probably something that

187
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,957
you might be somewhat familiar with.

188
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:31,141
And the term primates is general,

189
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:32,704
these animals that look like

190
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:34,779
they either live in trees or rain forests,

191
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,941
or they're descendant of things that live in trees

192
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:39,104
or they have these things that they can grasp things with.

193
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:41,721
They're good at climbing broadly, not all of them are.

194
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,406
Humans are probably the worst primates

195
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,681
when it comes to climbing, or one of the worst.

196
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,528
But that's the general classification that we...

197
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:49,543
that's what we generally think of

198
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,827
when we think of a primates.

199
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:53,314
And if we think of a primate that is not a great ape,

200
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,003
you just have to think of a baboon.

201
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:58,050
So this right here is a baboon.

202
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,587
It is a primate, but it is not a great ape.

203
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:01,809
It is probably descendant.

204
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:04,022
Some baboons actually don't live in trees,

205
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:05,679
but all of them are probably descendant

206
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,259
from things that first live in trees and

207
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,510
that's why their hands and their feet look the way they do.

208
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,468
Now you get into an even broader level of classification.

209
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,286
You get to the mammals, and once again,

210
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,322
probably something you're used to thinking about,

211
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:20,074
mammals are air-breathing animals.

212
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:21,923
They tend to have fur or hair.

213
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:26,669
They tend to provide some form of milk for their young.

214
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,385
They have active memory glands.

215
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,096
There're other things we can talk about what makes mammals.

216
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,291
I am not going into the rigorous definition.

217
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,069
But just to give you an example of a mammal that is not a primate,

218
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,976
I can show you a polar bear right over here.

219
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:44,411
This is a mammal, mammal that is not a primate.

220
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,070
I can do other thing. I can show you a tiger

221
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,913
or I can show you a giraffe or a horse.

222
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:52,732
By no stretch of the imagination, am I being comprehensive.

223
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:57,094
Let's keep getting broader. Now let's go to the class.

224
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,671
Or we are already at the class Mammalia.

225
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,178
Now let's go to the Phylum.

226
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:03,880
And Phylum...we are humans.

227
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,356
All mammals we are in the Phylum Chordates.

228
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:10,710
And Chordates we are actually in the sub Phylum,

229
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,054
which I didn't write here vertebrate,

230
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:13,439
which means we have a vertebra.

231
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,421
We have a spinal column with a spinal chordate.

232
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,399
Chordates are a little more general.

233
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,469
Chordate is a Phylum where kind of the arrangement

234
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,552
where the mouth is, where the digestive organs,

235
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:25,651
where the anus is, where the spinal column is,

236
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,688
where the brains, where the eyes, where the mouth.

237
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,592
They are kind of all in the same place.

238
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:31,555
If you think about it, everything I listed here,

239
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,472
kind of has the same general structure.

240
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,725
You have a spinal column.

241
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,133
You have a brain.

242
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:38,041
You have a mouth.

243
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,608
And the mouth leads to some type of digestive column.

244
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:42,912
In the end of it, you have an anus over there.

245
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:45,651
You have eyes in front of the brain.

246
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,360
So this is the general way.

247
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
I am not being very rigorous here.

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,706
It's how you describe a Chordate.

249
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,993
To show a Chordate that is not a mammal,

250
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,872
you just have to think about fish or sharks.

251
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,283
So this right over here,

252
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:05,248
this right over here is a non mammal Chordate.

253
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,292
This is a great white shark over here.

254
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,743
Let's go even broader.

255
00:10:08,743 --> 00:10:09,830
You'll see, now we are getting to things

256
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,317
that are very very not human like.

257
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,014
So you go one step broader.

258
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:19,953
Now we are at Animalia, the kingdom of animals.

259
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,376
This is the broadest definition

260
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,644
or the broadest category that Carl Linnaeus thought about.

261
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:26,944
Actually he did go into trees as well.

262
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:28,427
When you think about kingdom of animals,

263
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,111
you think of things that aren't Chordates.

264
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,265
You start going into things like insects

265
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,644
You start going into things like jellyfish.

266
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,055
If you go even broader,

267
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:37,668
now we are talking about the domain.

268
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:38,825
You go into Eukarya.

269
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:42,183
So these are all organisms that have cells.

270
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,863
Inside those cells, they have complex structures.

271
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:47,033
So if you are Eukarya,

272
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:48,502
you have cells with complex structures.

273
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:49,819
If you are Prokarya,

274
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,707
you don't have complex structures inside your cells.

275
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,124
But other Eukarya that are not animals,

276
00:10:55,124 --> 00:11:00,015
include things like plants.

277
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:01,586
Obviously I am giving no justice

278
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:03,520
to this whole branch of the tree of life.

279
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,884
It can be just as rich

280
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,659
or richer than everything I have drawn over here.

281
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,769
This is just a small fraction of the entire tree of life.

282
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,328
Let's go even broader than that.

283
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:14,333
So if you go even broader than that,

284
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,242
You say what's a kind of life form that isn't Eukarya?

285
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,593
That wouldn't have these more complex cell structures,

286
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:24,905
that is, the mitochondria in the cells, the cell nucleus-es.

287
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:28,712
Then you just have to think about something like bacteria.

288
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,118
If you want to go even broader,

289
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:31,552
there are things like viruses that

290
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:34,319
you can even debate whether they really even are life,

291
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,922
because they are dependent on other life forms

292
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:38,889
for their actual reproduction.

293
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,840
But they do have genetic materials like everything else.

294
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,008
That to me is kind of a mind blowing idea.

295
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:45,604
As different as a plant is,

296
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,350
look at house plants that are in your house right now,

297
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,919
or the tree when you walk home,

298
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,389
or bacteria or this jellyfish,

299
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,109
there is the commonality that we all have DNA.

300
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,831
That DNA for the most part

301
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,537
replicates in a very very very similar way.

302
00:11:57,537 --> 00:11:59,889
So it's actually crazy that we are actually even all related.

303
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,130
We even do have a common ancestor,

304
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,597
or some of these things.

305
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,090
That even begs the question:

306
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,642
what are about things like viruses?

307
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,144
Anyway I'll leave you here.

308
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,638
I really just want to let you know that

309
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:11,649
make sure you realize that

310
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,497
it's definitely worth studying,

311
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:15,877
because we understand

312
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:19,879
where we fit in the universe of living things.

313
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,425
But I also want to let you know that

314
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,542
it is a little bit of an art on where you decide

315
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,062
where to make these classifications,

316
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,772
where you decide to focus on,

317
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,728
what you want to focus on,

318
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,539
you know, what properties,

319
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,635
how they reproduce

320
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,157
or how they feed their their young

321
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:36,576
or can they move around

322
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:39,388
or what they breed whatever, things like that.

323
00:12:39,388 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway I let you go there.
