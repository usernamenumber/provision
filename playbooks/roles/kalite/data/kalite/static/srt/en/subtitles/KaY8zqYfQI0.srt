1
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:09,777
We're standing in the Piazza, the square in front of the Pantheon.

2
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,555
This is the best preserved ancient Roman monument.

3
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,622
And yet look at the sense of age.

4
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:19,175
Look at the weathering, the way in which its history is revealed through its surface.

5
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:20,347
It's been attacked.

6
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:23,459
Its original bronze fittings have been ripped off.

7
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:30,537
Look at the numerous holes, for instance, in the pediment that tell of all the different purposes that this building has been put to.

8
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,130
Originally a temple to the gods.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,589
Then sanctified and made into a church.

10
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,007
Now, of course it is also a major tourist attraction.

11
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:41,175
This is a building that has had just a tremendously complex history.

12
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:44,090
You can see it all over its surface.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,835
We’re seeing it very differently than anyone in antiquity would have seen it.

14
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:53,003
In fact we're standing many feet higher than we would have been in the ancient world.

15
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:58,165
Rome accumulated elevation from the debris of history.

16
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,745
Once, you would have stepped up to the porch of the Pantheon.

17
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,496
Now we actually glide downhill.

18
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:08,881
And the space in front of the Pantheon was framed by a colonnade.

19
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:19,623
And the colonnade and the other buildings that would have originally surrounded this building would have obscured the barrel on the side, and so that we would have only seen this very traditional temple front.

20
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:20,553
   

21
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,119
Exactly, it would have been something very familiar.

22
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,757
And the surprise was what happened as you approached the threshold.

23
00:01:26,757 --> 00:01:30,622
I have to tell you that I'm absolutely in love with those massive columns.

24
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:33,914
They're supported by these enormous marble bases.

25
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:37,705
They rise up unarticulated – without any fluting.

26
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:44,810
And then, and in these massive fragments of what were the originally marble Corinthian capitals.

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,174
These are monoliths, they’re single pieces of stone.

28
00:01:48,174 --> 00:02:00,317
Unlike Greek columns, they were not segments and they were not cut and they were imported from Egypt which was symbolic of Rome’s power over most of the Mediterranean under the Emperor Hadrian, who was responsible for the construction of this building.

29
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:01,363
So let's go in.

30
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:02,418
Let's go under the porch.

31
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:05,964
Let's go through those massive bronze doors.

32
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:11,586
We've just walked in under the strictly rectilinear porch, and then the space opens up.

33
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:15,516
Opens up into this vast circular space.

34
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:19,456
The width of the building and the height of the building completely fills my field of vision

35
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:25,040
and it is in a sense an expression of the limits of my sight.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,527
Unlike a basilica, this is a radial building –

37
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:33,476
that is to say that it has a central point and radiates outward from that central point.

38
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:41,381
But what's fascinating about this building is it's not a traditional radial structure in that the point would be on the floor.

39
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:48,612
The central point – its focus – is midway between the floor and the ceiling, and midway between its walls.

40
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:54,565
It is large enough and geometrically perfect enough to accommodate a perfect sphere.

41
00:02:54,565 --> 00:03:06,051
And as soon as you walk in, you notice that there's a kind of obsession with circles, with rectangles, with squares, with those kinds of perfect geometrical shapes.

42
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:10,111
This is a structure that is concerned with the ideal geometries.

43
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,724
But it also locates our place within those geometries.

44
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:18,276
But the experience of being in this space is anything but static.

45
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,356
No, it's really dynamic in fact.

46
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:30,434
And one of the causes of that is if we move our eye up the columns, we can see that they're beautifully aligned with the frieze of false windows that are just above them.

47
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:33,534
But then all that does not align with the dome.

48
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,934
That's right, they don't align with the coffers that we see in the dome.

49
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:47,430
What that does is create this feeling that the barrel that the dome rests on is independent from the dome, and almost makes it feel as though the dome could rotate.

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:04:01,037
That complex visual relationship between the dome and the decorative structures in the barrel remind us that this actual structural system here is dependent on concrete, and not these decorative columns that we see on the interior.

51
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:07,251
Exactly, there's this thick, thick barrel of concrete that supports the dome.

52
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:15,762
Because the dome pushes down and out, Roman architects had to think about how to support the weight and pressure of the dome.

53
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:20,817
And one of the things that’s doing that are the thick concrete walls of the barrel.

54
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,347
You know, the Romans had really perfected concrete.

55
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,139
And this is one of the buildings that shows what was possible.

56
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,515
This is shaping space.

57
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:38,998
Because concrete could be continuous, it could be built upward continuously with wooden forms which would then be removed, and could then open this space up in a way that post and lintel architecture never could.

58
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:49,126
So concrete could be laid onto a wooden support or poured into a mold, and could be shaped in a way that you can't do with post and lintel architecture.

59
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:53,186
Well what it does, is it allows for this vast open uninterrupted space.

60
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:55,773
We walk into the space and we feel freed.

61
00:04:55,773 --> 00:05:01,159
We are given a tremendous amount of freedom, in terms of how we move and how we see through this space.

62
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:11,266
Because of the Roman use of concrete, the idea that architecture could be something that shaped space and that could have a different kind of relationship to the viewer [took root].

63
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:14,748
It is, even now, in the 21st century, awesome.

64
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:23,756
The Emperor Hadrian, under whose direction this building was constructed, apparently loved the building and loved to actually have visitors come to him here.

65
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:27,701
One can imagine him even in the back apse opposite the entrance.

66
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:34,714
The Pantheon originally contained sculptures of the gods and of the deified emperors, we think.

67
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:36,183
It really was about the divine.

68
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:41,307
It was about the earthly sphere meeting the heavenly sphere.

69
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:44,083
And also, in some way, about human perception.

70
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,262
Look how rich this surface is.

71
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:52,534
And there would have been much more in antiquity when the coffers probably had gilded rosettes.

72
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:56,766
As we look at the drum, we see colored marble.

73
00:05:56,766 --> 00:06:00,323
We see purples, and oranges, and blues.

74
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:04,137
Remember these marbles are taken from around the Roman Empire.

75
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:08,631
So this is really an expression of Hadrian’s wealth and Hadrian's power.

76
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:15,266
This is the Empire being able to reach across the globe to draw in these precious materials.

77
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:23,294
Perhaps the most exciting part of this space is the oculus, because it almost seems to defy reason.

78
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,571
How could there be a hole in the center of that dome?

79
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,985
It doesn't make sense.

80
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:34,523
Well, it’s the only light that comes into the space, with the exception of some light wells in some other recessed areas,

81
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:37,624
and of course the grill just above the door, and the door itself.

82
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,730
There is one great window.

83
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,034
And my students, for years, have asked, “Is there glass?”

84
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:44,647
And, of course, the answer is "No."

85
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:47,102
When it rains, the floor gets wet.

86
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:53,488
The perfect circle of that oculus – the perfect circle of the dome –

87
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:57,987
The oculus is critical in the issues that you had raised before.

88
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:02,465
This is a building that, in some way, is a reflection of the movement of the heavens.

89
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:07,398
And what happens is light moves into this space from the sun.

90
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:16,317
It projects, often, a very sharp circle on the dome, and moves across the floor of the building, as the sun moves across the sky –

91
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:19,377
and then eventually creeps up the other side of the dome.

92
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:24,610
And so this entire building functions, in some ways, almost like a sundial.

93
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,547
It makes visible the movements of the heavens, and makes them manifest here on earth.

94
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:34,458
We've been talking about this building as a great monument of the ancient world.

95
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,048
But it was admired and copied in the Renaissance.

96
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:44,089
And, in fact, is perhaps the most influential building in architecture in the Renaissance, and in the modern era.

97
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,940
I mean, think about all of the different architects that have referenced this building.

98
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:56,895
I'm looking down at the floors and the geometry that you spoke of, the circles and the squares – and thinking about the pavement in front of the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue, in New York.

99
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:02,614
Actually, once you know the Pantheon, you begin to see copies of it and pieces of it everywhere.

100
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:03,451
It's true.

101
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:07,698
The dome, especially, is perhaps the most copied element – especially with the oculus.

102
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:11,206
You can see that, for instance, in the National Gallery in Washington.

103
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:16,446
You can see it in almost every neo-classical building in Europe and North America.

104
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:21,127
But before we leave I'd love to go and pay homage to Raphael, who's buried just over there.
