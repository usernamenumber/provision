1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,420
We saw on the last video that
if I have some sort of

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,910
orthonormal basis, I should have
a shorthand for this-- if

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:17,860
I have an orthonormal basis,
then to find for a subspace V,

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,290
and if I want to find the
projection of some vector x in

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:30,670
Rn onto V, the transformation
matrix simplifies to A times A

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,030
transpose times x.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,040
Where A is equal to essentially,
or exactly, the

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,490
matrix with the basis
vectors as columns.

10
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,780
So lets say v1, v2, all the way
through vk, these are the

11
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,790
basis vectors.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,290
Basis orthonormal, maybe I'll
write it like this,

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,150
orthonormal basis
vectors for V.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,380
We saw this in the last video,
and that was another reason

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,970
why we like orthonormal bases.

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,670
Let's do this with an actual
concrete example.

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:14,530
So let's say V is equal to
the span of the vector

18
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:21,940
1/3, 2/3, and 2/3.

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:33,160
And the vector 2/3, 1/3,
and minus 2/3.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,560
Now, we've already seen that
these two guys are linearly

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,060
independent and they both have
length 1, and then they're

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,160
both orthogonal to each other.

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,390
So we could say b, so we can say
the set-- let me write it

24
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,220
this way-- we'll call this
vector 1 for shorthand, if

25
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,780
that's v1 and that this is v2,
we know that the set of v1 and

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:08,370
v2, is an orthonormal
basis for V.

27
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:14,040
Now, we want to use this result
to find the projection.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,040
We want to find the
transformation matrix for the

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,930
projection of any vector x in
R-- well in this case, it's

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,440
going to be in R3, onto
our subspace, onto V.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,430
And the subspace is going
to be a plane in R3.

32
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,480
What's it going to be?

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,550
Well, we found the result that
we just have to construct-- we

34
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,400
have to construct a matrix A,
which is equal to-- which has

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,060
these guys as a column
vectors.

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:51,930
So 1/3, 2/3, 2/3, and 2/3,
1/3, and minus 2/3.

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,490
And if we construct A in that
way, then the projection of x

38
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,270
onto V, this linear
transformation can be

39
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:05,200
represented as A times
A transpose times x.

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,490
So to find our transformation
matrix, we just have to

41
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,770
multiply this guy times
his transpose.

42
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,190
So let's do that.

43
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,300
Let me just copy
and paste this.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,310
OK, let me do it right here.

45
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,270
   

46
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,720
So that's A.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,870
I need to multiply that
times A transpose.

48
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:39,590
A transpose is just going to
be 1/3, 2/3, 2/3, 1/3, and

49
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,930
then 2/3, minus 2/3.

50
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,340
   

51
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,490
That's A transpose.

52
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,530
So what is this going
to be equal to?

53
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,020
We have a 3 by 2, times a 2 by
3 matrix, so it's going to

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,375
result in a 3 by 3 matrix.

55
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,980
   

56
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,970
Which makes sense, because this
thing right here should

57
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,830
be a mapping from R3 to R3.

58
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,190
Right?

59
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,110
You give me some member of R3,
and I'm going to give you

60
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,370
another member of R3 that is in
my subspace V, and is the

61
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,019
projection of x onto V, and
we've also seen, the closest

62
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,410
member of V to x.

63
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,269
So what is this going to be?

64
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,960
It's going to be a
3 by 3 matrix.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,540
We have a 3 by 3 matrix.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,000
And so this first term, right
here, we're going to dot this

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,380
guy with this guy.

68
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,210
So it's going to be 1/3 times
1/3, which is 1/9,

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,320
plus 2/3 times 2/3.

70
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,010
So it's going to be
1/9 plus 4/9.

71
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,590
So I think we're going to be
dealing with a lot of ninths

72
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,520
here, so let me just divide
everything by nine.

73
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,220
So it's going be 1/9 plus 4/9
which is 5/9, but I'll just

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,440
write a 5 here.

75
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,660
And just know that we're
going to divide

76
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,720
everything by 9 at the end.

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,990
So that's that guy dotted
with that guy.

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,330
Now let's take the dot of
this guy with this guy.

79
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm going to get 2/9
plus 2/9, right?

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,370
That's 4/9.

81
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,520
Now I'm going to dot this
guy with this guy.

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,170
2/9 minus 4/9, that
is minus 2/9.

83
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,470
Now let's take the dot of the
this row, we're in the second

84
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,010
row and we're going to have to--
the dot of 2/3 and 1/3 is

85
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,706
2/9 plus 2/9, that is 4/9.

86
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,910
Let's put a 4 there,
we have 4/9.

87
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,400
Then we have 2/9 plus
1/9 is 3/9.

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,110
Let me get make sure
I got that right.

89
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:47,290
2/9-- oh sorry, 2/3 times 2/3 is
4/3, so it's 4- sorry, 2/3

90
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:52,360
times 2/3 is 4/9, plus
1/9, is 5/9.

91
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,110
And then we have 4/9
minus 2/9 is 2/9.

92
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,110
And then, let's do this last
one, we're almost there.

93
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,320
I hope you already appreciate
that this is a lot less

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,040
painful than we had to take A
transpose A, and then inverse

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,640
it in between.

96
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,870
We're just taking A
times A transpose.

97
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,150
So 2/3 times 1/3, that's
2/9 minus 4/9, so

98
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,260
that's minus 2/9.

99
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,560
And then we have 4/9 minus
2/9, that's 2/9.

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,850
And then we have 4/9 plus
4/9, so that is 8/9.

101
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,990
So just like that we were
able to figure out the

102
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,730
transformation matrix for the
projection of any vector in R3

103
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,700
onto our subspace V.

104
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,700
And this was a lot less painful
than the ways that

105
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,670
we've done it in the past.

106
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,934
