1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,001
We're in the Atraskan museum

2
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,606
in the Vatican Museums in Rome, and we're looking at my favorite

3
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:15,244
pot in the entire world. I can see why it's your favorite

4
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:19,185
pot. Seems to almost glow. The thing that makes it so fabulous

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,670
is we have these two heroes and we have a very simple image, but it's

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,733
giving us so much information. The heroes are

7
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:30,910
Achilles on the left and Ajax on the right, two of the great Greek

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,972
heroes featured in Homers Iliad and Exekias

9
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:38,808
is the potter who signed only two pots as the potter

10
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:42,800
and the painter, has identified these two figures by including

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,837
their names above them. He's also telling us what's happening

12
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:50,438
between the two. Achilles on the left is saying

13
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:54,749
the word four. You can see Tesra. And on the right

14
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:58,333
we see Ajax saying three; tri.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:03,091
We know immediately that Achilles is winning the game that they're playing.

16
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,137
But this is of course a metaphor for the way that this myth will unfold

17
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:10,512
On either side, we see their shields. Achilles

18
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:17,336
still has his helmet on, although Ajax has taken his off - so a moment of relaxation between battles.

19
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:22,170
They are on the battlefield of Troy. Exekias has given us even more information in this.

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,748
not just the rolls of the dice and in larger sense - their fate.

21
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:33,742
Look at the way for example that while both figures are hunched over and focused at the game at hand,

22
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:37,037
and remember, these two men are really close friends,

23
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:42,669
so there is an intimacy here, brotherhood. Nevertheless Achilles, who has the higher role,

24
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:47,150
is holding his spears loosely, you can see the way the points are actually separating.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,104
At the bottom you can see from the lines they're not as parallel.

26
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:55,279
But look at the figure at the right - Ajax, whose spears are held in a more parallel way,

27
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:58,248
so that we know that he is actually clinching with his fist,

28
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:02,607
he's tense. I even sensed a little bit of that tension in his brow.

29
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:10,941
Well, that's right, if you look at his brow really closely, you can see that Achilles has a single incised line to represent his brow.

30
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:17,004
But Ajax has a double line and it is a sort of clue that perhaps there's a little bit of tension there.

31
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,919
One other detail that can be easely seen, although it is really saddle,

32
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,914
look at the === of both figures.

33
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:27,376
Achilles again is relaxed, his heel is on the ground line,

34
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:34,336
But Ajax, his heel is picked up ever so slightly, so you can see the lithe bit of light underneath it.

35
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:39,410
Which means that his calf is engaged, those muscles are tense, his body is tense.

36
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,701
He is also a little bit more hunched over, his head is a little bit lower that that of his friend Achilles.

37
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:50,408
That does seam to mean something wider than just this board game.

38
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:56,749
Anybody who's looking it this pod in the ancient world would have known the story of Ajax and Achilles that Hommers tells.

39
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:01,203
As you said, Achilles is a great hero.

40
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:08,206
In fact, as a child his mother dipped him in the river Styx, which had the magical quality of making him invincible.

41
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:12,933
It's just that she held him by his heel, so his heel was not protected.

42
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:17,101
And ultimately he will be killed by an arrow that hits him there.

43
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:23,270
Hence, the term that we use often of "someone's Achilles' heel", that is their vulnerable spot.

44
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,002
Nevertheless, Achilles would die a great hero.

45
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,504
Ajax has a more complicated fate.

46
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:33,376
He will outlive Achilles and carry his great friend off the battle field.

47
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:37,544
Then ultimately he'll be in a battle for Achilles' armor.

48
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:43,694
Achilles has a very special armor, which has been made by the god Hephaestus.

49
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:49,906
Two people would want that armor and they would both give speeches to convince judges as to who should get the armor.

50
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:56,659
But Ajax, though he was closer to Achilles, would lose the contenst, have a bad moment, where he slayd a bunch of Greeks

51
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:02,081
and ultimately would kill himself on his own sword - humiliation at the end of his life.

52
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:08,102
So it's really interesting to think about this as an ancient Greek viewer who knows the whole story

53
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:11,169
and what would unfold for both of those heroes.

54
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:16,703
But the story is one thing and the way that Exekias the potter has represented this moment,

55
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:24,343
and these two figures with so much nobility, with such fine detail in the shape of a vase,

56
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:26,970
which is so elegant, is something else.

57
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,467
Exekias really was the great master of attic black-figure vase painting.

58
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:39,739
These black figures, they are silhouettes, that if you look closely, the decorative forms is mostly put inside with needle.

59
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:43,704
And the black surface is like paint, but is not quite paint.

60
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:53,505
This is slip-wear. The Greeks didn't had the technology to get kilns ovens hot enough to vitrify that is to create true gleasers the way ceramics do now.

61
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:58,936
So what they would do instead is they would take very fine particles of clay, suspend them in water

62
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,505
and use those as a kind of paint and depending on amount of oxygen they allowed into a kiln

63
00:05:03,505 --> 00:05:08,801
it would turn it black or red. They would paint the surface with the slip and then

64
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:13,197
they would burnish it, that is they would take a very smooth surface, imagine the back of a spoon,

65
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:20,604
and they would rub it back and fort so you get this surface that is really glossy and it almost looks like gliss.

66
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:27,771
When I look closely at the decorative borders on the handles or the decorative border just above the figures,

67
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:32,709
I can see beautiful detail and it's almost in three dimentional form.

68
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,272
The slip is almoust raised in areas, so it catches the light.

69
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:41,168
Well, the Greeks did often =========

70
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:45,711
And so, one could imagine almost decorating a cake.

71
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:51,700
You have a kind of ............ and it leaves a kind of bead that is raised against the surface.

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,637
And in a much finer level, that's what we're seeing here.

73
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:59,437
So, Exekias is a master, hes pots stand out in so many ways,

74
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:04,142
in their shape, and the painting, and the detail, in the drama,

75
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,802
that he was able to convey.

76
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:10,669
Well, certainly the Etruscans thought that was the case, because they must have spent a good deal of money

77
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:17,210
importing this pot from Greece across the Mediterranean all the way to the Italian peninsula, where they lived.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:23,499
You know, so many of the great pots from ancient Greece were actually buried in Etruscan tombs.

79
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:28,011
They were imported, the Greeks did a tremendous business, exporting such pots.

80
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,567
Exekias was one of the great masters.
