1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
You're just walking down the street

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,040
and someone comes up to you

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,210
and says "Quick! Quick!--

4
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,120
4792. Is this divisible by 3? This is an emergency!

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,700
Tell me as quickly as possible!

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,010
And luckily you have a little tool in your toolkit

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,110
where you know how to test for divisibility by 3

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,510
Well, you say I can just add up the digits

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,810
If the sum of that is a multiple of 3

10
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,590
then this whole thing is a multiple of 3

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:27,470
So you say 4 plus 7 plus 9 plus 2

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,730
That's 11. Plus 9, it's 20. Plus 2 is 22

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,660
That's not divisible by 3

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,860
If you're unsure, you can even add the digits of that

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,360
2 plus 2 is 4. Clearly not divisible by 3

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,580
So this thing right over here is not divisible by 3

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,070
And so luckily that emergency was saved

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,840
But then you walk down the street a little bit more

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,060
and someone comes up to you--- "Quick! Quick! Quick! 386,802--

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,900
Is that divisible by 3?"

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,360
Well, you employ the same tactic

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,800
You say, what's 3 plus 8 plus 6 plus 8 plus 0 plus 2?

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,540
3 plus 8 is 11. Plus 6 is 17. Plus 8 is 25. Plus 2 is 27

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,090
Well, 27 is divisible by 3

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,610
And if you're unsure, you could add these digits right over here

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,810
2 plus 7 is equal to 9. Clearly divisible by 3

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,790
So this is divisible by 3 as well

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,340
So now you feel pretty good

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,230
You've helped two perfect strangers with their emergencies

30
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,360
You figured out if these numbers were divisible by 3

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,100
very very very very quickly

32
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,510
But you have a nagging feeling

33
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,690
Because you're not quite sure why that worked

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,840
You've just kind of always known it

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,740
And so, let's think about why it worked

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,410
To think about it, I'll just pick a random number

37
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,390
But we could do this really for any number

38
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,910
But I don't want to go too puffy on it

39
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,290
just so you can see it's pretty common sense here

40
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,060
And the number we'll use is 498

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,440
I can literally use any number in this situation

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,220
And to think about why this whole little tool

43
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,530
this little system works

44
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,020
we just have to rewrite 498

45
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,510
We can rewrite the 4- since it's in the hundred's place

46
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,740
we can write that as 4 times 100

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,460
Or 4 times 100, that's the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99

48
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,410
That's all this 4 is

49
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,910
400, which is the same thing as 4 times 100

50
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,360
which is the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,030
And the little trick here is I want to write-

52
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,530
instead of writing 100, I want to write this as the sum of 1

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,620
plus something that is divisible by 3

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,370
And 99 is divisible by 3

55
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,050
If I add more digits here- 999, 9999--

56
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,630
they're all divisible by 3

57
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,950
And this is why you can do the same reasoning for divisibility by 9

58
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,690
Because they are divisible by 9 as well

59
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,630
Anyway, that's what the 4 in the hundred's place represents

60
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,270
This 9 in the ten's place- well that represents 90

61
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,460
or 9 times 10, or 9 times 1 plus 9

62
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,780
And then finally this 8. That's in the one's place

63
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,320
8 times 1, or we just write plus 8

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,800
Now we can distribute this 4

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:04,520
This is 4 times 1 plus 4 times 99. So it's 4 plus 4 times 99

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,670
Actually let me write it like this. I'm going to write--

67
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,640
Actually let me write it first like 4 plus 4 times 99

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,960
Do the same thing over here

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,290
This is the same thing as plus 9--

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:26,100
do that magenta color- plus 9 plus 9 times 9

71
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,390
And then finally I have this 8 right over here

72
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,290
And I can rearrange everything

73
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,900
These terms right over here, the 4 times 99, and the 9 times 9

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,140
I can write over here

75
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,550
4 times 99- I'll write what's like a different notation

76
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,040
plus the 9 times the 9, that's those two terms

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:54,190
and then we have the plus 4 plus 9 plus 8

78
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,990
Well, can we now tell whether this is divisible by 3?

79
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,880
These terms, these first two terms are definitely divisible by 3

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,290
This's divisible by 3 because 99 is divisible by 3

81
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,640
regardless of what we have already

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,810
you don't even have to look at this

83
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,980
This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying it

84
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,340
it's still going to be divisible by 3

85
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,140
This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying this whole thing

86
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,630
it's still going to be divisible by 3

87
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,380
If you add two things that are divisible by 3

88
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,130
the whole thing is going to be divisible by 3

89
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,290
So all of this is divisible by 3

90
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,820
And if you have another digit here, you'd done the same exact thing

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,270
Instead of having 1 plus 99, you'd had 1 plus 999, 1 plus 9999, etc

92
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,480
So the only thing you have to really worry about

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,990
is this part right over here

94
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,460
you have to ask yourself

95
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,440
in order for this whole thing to be divisible by 3

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,630
this part is- well that part is, then this part

97
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,480
in order for the whole thing has to be divisible by 3

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,120
that also has to be divisible by 3

99
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,890
But what is this right over here?

100
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,450
These are just our original digits

101
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,630
498. 4 and 9 and 8

102
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,650
We just have to make sure that when we take the sum

103
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,000
it's divisible by 3
