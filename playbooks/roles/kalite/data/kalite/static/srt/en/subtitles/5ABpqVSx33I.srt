1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,050
I want to use this video to kind of make sure

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,390
we, intuitively and otherwise,

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:12,616
understand the difference between a Z-statistic...

4
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:13,905
something I have trouble saying -

5
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:19,850
and a t-statistic.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,338
So in a lot of what we're doing in this inferential statistics,

7
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,264
we're trying to figure out what is the probability

8
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:28,610
of getting a certain sample mean.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,373
So what we've been doing,

10
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:32,315
- especially when we have a large sample size -

11
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:35,502
so let me just draw a sampling distribution here.

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,480
So let's say we have a sampling distribution of the

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,040
sample mean right here.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,557
It has some assumed mean value

15
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:48,090
and some standard deviation.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,920
What we want to do is any result that we get,

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,460
let's say we get some sample mean out here.

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,350
We want to figure out the probability of getting

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,700
a result at least as extreme as this.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,170
So you can either figure out the probability of getting

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,614
a result below this and subtract that from 1,

22
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:08,470
or just figure out this area right over there.

23
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,720
And to do that we've been figuring out how many

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,120
standard deviations above the mean we actually are.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,010
The way we figured that out is we take our sample mean,

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,200
we subtract from that our mean itself,

27
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,350
what we assume the mean should be,

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,890
or maybe we don't know what this is.

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,447
And then we divide that by the standard deviation

30
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,956
of the sampling distribution.

31
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:40,804
We divide that by the standard deviation

32
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:42,783
of the sampling distribution.

33
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:44,700
This is how many standard deviations

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,100
we are above the mean.

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,860
That is that distance right over there.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,420
Now, we usually don't know what this is either.

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,840
We normally don't know what that is either.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,020
And the central limit theorem told us that assuming that

39
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,650
we have a sufficient sample size, this thing right here,

40
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,913
this thing is going to be the same thing as...

41
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:16,257
the standard deviation of our population

42
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:19,231
divided by the square root of our sample size.

43
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:24,930
So this thing right over here can be re-written as our

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,290
sample mean minus the mean of our sampling distribution

45
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,510
of the sample mean divided by this thing right here--

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,482
divided by our population mean,

47
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:39,160
divided by the square root of our sample size.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,830
And this is essentially our best sense of how many

49
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,650
standard deviations away from the actual mean we are.

50
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,131
And this thing right here, we've learned it before,

51
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,532
is a Z-score.

52
00:02:49,532 --> 00:02:51,780
Or when we're dealing with an actual statistic when

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,631
it's derived from the sample mean statistic,

54
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:58,327
we call this a Z-statistic.

55
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:02,080
And then we could look it up in a Z-table or in a normal

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,730
distribution table to say what's the probability of

57
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,330
getting a value of this Z or greater.

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,890
So that would give us that probability.

59
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,640
So what's the probability of getting that

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,680
extreme of a result?

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,350
Now normally when we've done this in the last few videos,

62
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,270
we also do not know what the standard deviation

63
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,550
of the population is.

64
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,200
So in order to approximate that, we say that the Z-score

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,556
is approximately, or the Z-statistic,

66
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:36,623
is approximately going to be

67
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,460
-- so let me just write the numerator over again --

68
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,363
-- we estimate this using our sample standard deviation -

69
00:03:45,363 --> 00:03:47,797
-- let me do this in a new color--

70
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:53,623
with using our sample standard deviation.

71
00:03:53,623 --> 00:04:02,830
And this is OK, if our sample size is greater than 30.

72
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,600
Or another way to think about it is this will be

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:14,310
normally distributed if our sample size is greater than 30.

74
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,211
Even this approximation will be

75
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,930
approximately normally distributed.

76
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,850
Now, if your sample size is less than 30,

77
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,180
especially if it's a good bit less than 30, all of a sudden,

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,730
this expression will not be normally distributed.

79
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,270
So let me re-write the expression over here.

80
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,140
Sample mean minus the mean of your sampling distribution of

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,640
the sample mean divided by your sample standard deviation

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,420
over the square root of your sample size.

83
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,100
We just said if this thing is well over 30, or at least 30,

84
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,747
then this value right here, this statistic,

85
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,520
is going to be normally distributed.

86
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,263
If it's not, if this is small,

87
00:04:54,263 --> 00:05:00,112
then this is going to have a t-distribution.

88
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,100
And then you're going to do the exact same thing you did

89
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,810
here, but now you would assume that the bell is no longer

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,380
a normal distribution, so this example it was normal.

91
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,160
All of Z's are normally distributed.

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,100
Over here in a t-distribution, and this will actually be a

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,120
normalized t-distribution right here because we

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,220
subtracted out the mean.

95
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,220
So in a normalized t-distribution,

96
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,410
you're going to have a mean of 0.

97
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,070
And what you're going to do is you want to figure out the

98
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,850
probability of getting a t-value at least this extreme.

99
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,680
So this is your t-value you would get, and then

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,513
you essentially figure out the area under the curve

101
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:39,030
right over there.

102
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,237
So a very easy rule of thumb is:

103
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:47,410
Calculate this quantity either way.

104
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,320
If you will have more than 30 samples,

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,272
if your sample size is more than 30,

106
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,195
your sample standard deviation is going to be a

107
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:59,250
good approximator for your population standard deviation.

108
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,392
And so this whole thing is going to be

109
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,387
approximately normally distributed,

110
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,757
and so you can use a Z-table to figure out

111
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:08,380
the probability of getting a result at least that extreme.

112
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,142
If your sample size is small, then this statistic,

113
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:19,410
this quantity, is going to have a t-distribution,

114
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,292
and then you're going to have to use a t-table

115
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:25,333
to figure out the probability of getting a t-value

116
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,547
at least this extreme.

117
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,330
And we're going to see this in an example a couple

118
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,486
of videos from now. Anyway,

119
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:34,029
hopefully that helped clarify some things in your head about

120
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:38,170
when to use a Z-statistic or when to use a t-statistic.
