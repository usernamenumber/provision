1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:02,191
Let's say we are operating...

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,943
...in three dimensions.

3
00:00:03,943 --> 00:00:05,960
And I have a function, rho,

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,192
...which is a function of (x,y,z)...

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,255
...and it gives us the mass density...

6
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,944
...at any point in three dimensions,

7
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:13,050
...of some fluid.

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,201
Some particular fluid.

9
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,548
Maybe it's a gas, or a fluid,

10
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,659
...water. Who knows what it is?

11
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,210
Some type of substance.

12
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,486
It gives us the mass density...

13
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,385
...at any point in three dimensions.

14
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,952
And let's say we have another...

15
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:24,559
...function. This is a scalar function.

16
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,776
It just gives us a number...

17
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,282
...for any point in 3D.

18
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:29,213
And then, let's say we have another function, v,

19
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:30,676
...which is a vector function.

20
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,069
It gives us a vector...

21
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:33,831
...for any point in three dimensions.

22
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:35,211
And this right over here tells us...

23
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,322
...the velocity of that same...

24
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:40,370
...the velocity of that same fluid or gas...

25
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,128
...or whatever we're talking about.

26
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:43,726
Now let's imagine another function.

27
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:45,544
And this might all look a little bit familiar, because we did it...

28
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:47,013
We went through a very similar exercise...

29
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,226
...in two dimensions when we talked about line integrals.

30
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:51,705
Now we're just extending it to three dimensions.

31
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:53,411
Let's say we have a function, f.

32
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,361
Let's say we have a function, f,

33
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:57,181
...and it is equal to...

34
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,292
...the product...

35
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:00,739
...the product of rho and v.

36
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,627
So for any point in (x,y,z)...

37
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,167
...this will give us a vector, and then...

38
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,666
...we'll multiply it times this scalar right over here...

39
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,910
...for that same point in three dimensions.

40
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,445
So it's equal to...

41
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,055
...rho times v.

42
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,494
Let me use the same color...

43
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,189
...that I used for v before.

44
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,369
And there's a couple of ways you could conceptualize this,

45
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,441
...so you could view this as...

46
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,845
Obviously it maintains the direction of the velocity,

47
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,746
...but now its magnitude...

48
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:33,759
One way to think about it is...

49
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,360
...kind of the momentum density.

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,514
And if that doesn't make too much sense,

51
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,176
...you don't have to worry too much about it.

52
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,189
Hopefully, as we use these two functions,

53
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,662
...and we talk-- think a little bit more...

54
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:42,829
...about them relative to a surface,

55
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:45,522
...it'll make a little bit more conceptual sense.

56
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,040
Now, what I want to do...

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,907
...is think about what it means...

58
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,007
...what it means...

59
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,242
...given this function, f,

60
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:54,191
...to evaluate the surface integral...

61
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,104
...over some surface...

62
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,823
So we're going to evaluate over some surface.

63
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:00,129
We're going to evaluate f...

64
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:04,403
We're going to evaluate f dot n,

65
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:07,194
...where n is the unit normal vector at every--

66
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,561
...at each point on that surface,

67
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,786
...dS.

68
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:12,829
d-surface.

69
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,981
So let's think about what this is saying.

70
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:18,216
So first, let me draw my axes.

71
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:21,621
So I have my z-axis.

72
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,085
z-axis...

73
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:24,409
This could be my...

74
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,650
Let's make that...

75
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,707
Let's make that my x-axis.

76
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:29,637
And let's say that this right over here...

77
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:31,654
...is my y-axis.

78
00:02:31,654 --> 00:02:33,124
And let's say my surface...

79
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,047
...I'll use that same color...

80
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:36,422
My surface looks something like that.

81
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,135
So that is my surface.

82
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:41,904
That is the surface in question.

83
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:43,526
That is S.

84
00:02:43,526 --> 00:02:44,838
Now let's think about the units,

85
00:02:44,838 --> 00:02:46,551
...and hopefully that'll give us conceptual understanding...

86
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,869
...of what this thing right over here is measuring.

87
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,094
It's completely analogous to...

88
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,590
...what we did in the two-dimensional case...

89
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,712
...with the line integrals.

90
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:54,595
So we have a dS.

91
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,244
A dS is a little chunk of area...

92
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,569
...of that surface.

93
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,524
So that is dS.

94
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:01,456
So this is going to be area.

95
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,304
And if we want to break...

96
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,077
This is...

97
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:04,404
We want to pick particular units...

98
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:06,053
This could be square...

99
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,460
This could be square meters.

100
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,344
And I think when we do...

101
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:10,137
...particular units, it starts to make...

102
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:11,971
...a little bit more concrete sense.

103
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,310
Now, the normal vector...

104
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,546
...at that dS...

105
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:15,661
The normal vector is going to...

106
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,535
...point right out of it.

107
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,604
It's literally normal to that plane.

108
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:20,818
It's literally normal to that plane.

109
00:03:20,818 --> 00:03:22,374
It has a magnitude 1.

110
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:24,409
So that is our unit normal vector.

111
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,568
And f is defined throughout this three-dimensional space.

112
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,855
You give me any (x,y,z),

113
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,089
...I'll know its mass density,

114
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:30,873
...I'll know its velocity,

115
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:32,059
...and I'll get some f.

116
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,009
I'll get some f at any point...

117
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,723
...at any point in three-dimensional space,

118
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,458
...including on the surface.

119
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,908
Including right over here.

120
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:41,925
So right over here, f might look...

121
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,376
...f might look something like this.

122
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:47,169
So that is f right at that point.

123
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:48,161
Right at that point.

124
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,142
So what does all of this mean?

125
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:50,408
Well when you take the dot product...

126
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:51,992
...of two vectors, this is essentially saying,

127
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:53,694
"How much do they go together?"

128
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:55,276
And since n is a unit vector,

129
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,776
...since it has a magnitude 1,

130
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,111
...it's-- this is essentially saying..

131
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:58,895
"What is..."

132
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:00,421
"What is the magnitude...

133
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:01,522
...of the component of f...

134
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,191
...that's going in the direction of n?"

135
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,338
Or the component-- Or...

136
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:05,941
"What is the magnitude of the...

137
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:06,759
...component of f that is...

138
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,740
...normal to the surface?"

139
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,595
Or "How much of f is normal...

140
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,311
...to the surface?"

141
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:12,820
So the component of f that is...

142
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,921
...normal to the surface...

143
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,053
...might look something like...

144
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,653
...might look something...

145
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,777
...like that.

146
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,395
Might look something like that.

147
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,875
And this right over here...

148
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,212
...will essentially just give...

149
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:25,777
...the magnitude of that.

150
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:26,730
And it's just going to...

151
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,007
It's just going to keep the units of f.

152
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,476
n, right over here, just specifies...

153
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,864
...a direction. It has no units associated with it.

154
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:33,944
It's dimensionless.

155
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:36,093
f's units are going to be...

156
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,875
...units of mass density,

157
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,827
So it could be...

158
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:39,928
It's going to be...

159
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:41,008
Let's say it could be...

160
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:44,496
...kilogram per meter-cubed.

161
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,195
That's...

162
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:46,924
Well that's actually just the rho part.

163
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:48,878
So it's mass density times velocity.

164
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:51,216
Times meters per second.

165
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:52,271
Let me write it in those colors...

166
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:52,911
...so we have...

167
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:54,437
...clear what's happening here.

168
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:55,604
So the units of f...

169
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:57,878
...are going to be the units of rho...

170
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,204
...which are going to be...

171
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:02,372
...kilogram per cubic meter...

172
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:03,579
That's mass density.

173
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,838
...times the units of v...

174
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,646
...which is meters per second.

175
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:09,124
Meters per second.

176
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:11,776
And we're going to multiply that times meters squared.

177
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:12,837
So what you have is...

178
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:13,557
You have a meter and then...

179
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:14,894
...a meter squared in the numerator...

180
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,512
That's meters cubed in the numerator.

181
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:17,946
And meters cubed in the denominator.

182
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:20,142
That, that, that cancels out.

183
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,846
And so the units that we get for this...

184
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,043
The units that we get for this...

185
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:26,474
...are kilogram per second.

186
00:05:26,474 --> 00:05:27,971
And so the way to conceptualize it...

187
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,833
Given how we've defined f...

188
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,041
...when we say what we say f represents...

189
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,361
The way to conceptualize this...

190
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,576
This is saying, "How much mass..."

191
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:37,399
"How much mass, given this mass density,

192
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,704
...this velocity, is going directly...

193
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,822
...out of this little dS,

194
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:42,359
...this little...

195
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,138
...'infinitesimally' chunk of surface...

196
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:46,156
...in a given amount of time?"

197
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:46,880
And then if we were to add up...

198
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,130
...all of the dS-es,

199
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,055
...and this is what essentially that surface integral is,

200
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,033
...we're essentially saying,

201
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,270
"How much mass,

202
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,606
...in kilograms per second,

203
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:55,324
...that's what we picked...

204
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,510
How much mass...

205
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,091
...is traveling across this surface...

206
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:01,721
...at any given moment in time?"

207
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:03,351
And this is really the same idea we do with...

208
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,287
...the line integrals.

209
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,908
This is essentially the flux through a two-dimensional surface.

210
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,352
So this is...

211
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:12,605
...the flux through a 2D surface.

212
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,164
And this isn't like...

213
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:21,582
...some crazy, abstract thing.

214
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,762
I mean, you could imagine...

215
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,023
You know, you could imagine...

216
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:26,717
...something like water vapor in your bathroom.

217
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:27,876
Water vapor in your bathroom.

218
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:28,722
And I like to imagine that,

219
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,910
...because that's actually visible,

220
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,107
...especially when sunlight is shining through it.

221
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:33,908
And we've all seen water vapor...

222
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:34,579
...through a...

223
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:35,725
...water vapor in our bathroom when...

224
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,241
...you have a ray of sunlight, and you can see...

225
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,240
...how the particles...

226
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,791
...how the particles are traveling.

227
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,321
And you see they have a certain density...

228
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:42,228
...at different points.

229
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:43,441
And so you could imagine...

230
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,526
You could imagine...

231
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:46,493
You care about the surface...

232
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,493
...the surface of your...

233
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,394
Maybe you have a window.

234
00:06:50,394 --> 00:06:52,509
Maybe you have a window in the bathroom.

235
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:53,885
So you have a window.

236
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:55,021
And so, if you were...

237
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,058
If the surface was the window,

238
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:57,704
...and the window...

239
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:58,777
And let's say the window's open,

240
00:06:58,777 --> 00:06:59,639
...so it's kind of a...

241
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,072
There's nothing physical there.

242
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,031
It's just kind of a...

243
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,899
...a rectangular surface that...

244
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,331
...things can pass freely through,

245
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,014
...if-- and f was essentially...

246
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:10,128
...the mass density of the water vapor times...

247
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,670
...the velocity of the water vapor,

248
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,677
...then this thing right over here will essentially tell you...

249
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:15,687
...the mass of water vapor that is traveling...

250
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,341
...through that window at any given moment of time.

251
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,774
Another way to think about it is...

252
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,804
Imagine a...

253
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:21,862
Imagine a river.

254
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,695
And I'm going to conceptualize this river...

255
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:24,606
...as kind of a...

256
00:07:24,606 --> 00:07:26,644
...just a section of the river.

257
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:27,894
And I'm conceptualizing it...

258
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:28,718
This is kind of...

259
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:29,218
...a river.

260
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:30,449
Obviously this would be the surface...

261
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,573
...that we normally see.

262
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:32,960
But obviously it has some depth.

263
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,585
It's three-dimensional in nature.

264
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:36,838
And so we would know the density.

265
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:37,686
Maybe it's constant.

266
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:40,060
You know the density, and you know the velocity...

267
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,105
...at any point.

268
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:42,786
That's what f gives us.

269
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:44,558
So that tells us...

270
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,789
As we said, we could view that as the...

271
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,358
...momentum density at any given point in time.

272
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:51,939
And maybe our surface is some type of a net.

273
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,434
Our surface is some type of a net.

274
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,010
And the net doesn't even have to be rectangular.

275
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,521
It could be some weird-shaped net.

276
00:07:56,521 --> 00:07:57,830
But I'll do it in rectangular, just because it's...

277
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,978
...easier to draw.

278
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,041
It's some type of net that in no way impedes the flow...

279
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,975
...of the fluid.

280
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:04,124
Then once again,

281
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:05,658
...when you evaluate this integral,

282
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:08,045
...it would tell you the mass of fluid that is flowing...

283
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,069
...through that net...

284
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,040
...at any given moment of time.

285
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,057
So hopefully this makes...

286
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,194
...a little bit of conceptual sense now.

287
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,044
In the next few videos,

288
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,088
...we'll actually think about...

289
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:16,804
...how to...

290
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,304
...how to calculate this,

291
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,008
...and how we can actually represent it...

292
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,745
...in different ways.
