1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:05,072
I'm going to tell you about a number that's cooler than pi, more mysterious than the golden ratio

2
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:06,974
weirder than e or i.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:11,912
Somehow in recent times we seemed to have forgotten just how incredible this number is

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,615
yet many ancient cultures knew of it.

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,055
Some even worshipped it.

6
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:19,987
It was known to Pythagoras, Ptolemy, and Zeno of Illyria.

7
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,656
It was independently discovered in East Asia

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,292
and there's even evidence that the Aztecs were aware of it.

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,262
It's pretty different from most other numbers you've heard of

10
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:33,088
but today's mathematicians are becoming increasingly fascinated by this ancient concept

11
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:38,972
and I want to bring back into the common knowledge how cool, how amazing this number really is.

12
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,678
A fitting name for this number is the obsolete Greek letter digamma

13
00:00:42,678 --> 00:00:46,880
which originally represented a 'W' sound and was called Wau.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,891
Trying to write wau in decimal notation is, I think

15
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,538
a misleading exercise which distracts from the nature

16
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:54,455
of the number itself.

17
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,424
One difficulty is that there's actually more than one way

18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,302
to represent it as an infinite decimal.

19
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:03,463
But, wau can be defined in some unconventional ways.

20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,934
Take this unusual fractal fraction.

21
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,590
How do you find out what this equals?

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,507
Let's see if it converges to something

23
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:13,762
If you had just one layer, it would be two over four

24
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:14,996
or, one half

25
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:18,312
Take two layers and it's three-fourths plus one-fourth

26
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,148
so that's four-fourths, so this is two over one

27
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,508
or just two.

28
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:25,124
Add another layer that's three over one, plus one over one

29
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:27,020
two over four again.

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,990
And for any finite number of layers, it will be one of those

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,094
But it turns out if you continue this fraction on to infinity

32
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,064
you get neither two over one, nor one over two.

33
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,066
but the curious number wau.

34
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,471
Here's another way to write wau.

35
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,304
Wau equals five-sixths plus, all over six, five-sixths

36
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,241
plus, all over six, five-sixths, plus, all over six

37
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,644
five-sixths, and so on.

38
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:55,482
This infinite fractal quality of wau lets you do some really crazy stuff.

39
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:58,986
Take this: wau to the wau to the wau to the wau,

40
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,404
but this is wau times wau, it's all wau times wau

41
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:04,942
I don't even know how to pronounce this, but

42
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:08,028
infinite fractal exponentiation of wau loops back

43
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,865
and equals wau. I mean, that's just wau!

44
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,242
And wau does have an intimate relationship with

45
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,812
other special numbers. Check this out.

46
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:20,140
Wau to the pi, to the wau, to the two pi, to the wau,

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,510
to the four pi, to the wau, to the eight pi...and so on

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,279
equals wau times square root wau

49
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,849
times cube root wau times...and so on.

50
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,418
I mean, this isn't much more mind-boggling than

51
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,421
thinking about what might happen if you tried raising

52
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,390
a number to an imaginary power.

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,662
Speaking of which, e to the two i pi equals wau.

54
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,698
Relatedly, you can find wau in calculus.

55
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,634
The derivative of e to the wau equals

56
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,037
wau e!

57
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,539
And e to the i to the e i o

58
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,208
is e to the wau to the tau wau wau

59
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,232
You might be tempted to try and solve these things

60
00:02:57,232 --> 00:03:00,763
using logarithms, but when you try to take

61
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,250
log base wau, it kind of doesn't work.

62
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,919
It's like, dividing by 0. Cool, right?

63
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,088
People talk about the geometry of the golden ratio

64
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,424
as if it's special, but it's actually pretty normal.

65
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,563
Normal numbers you can make a rectangle with that

66
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,429
proportion just fine. Make the proportion wau, and

67
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,335
well, you get something that most people wouldn't

68
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,901
call a rectangle unless you're a mathematician and being technical.

69
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:24,104
but if x and y are the sides of a wau rectangle,

70
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,339
meaning if x over y is wau, then x

71
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,577
plus x to the y, over y plus y to the x

72
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:35,015
equals wau. And, now if I take the previous two

73
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,118
x to the x to the y, and down here,

74
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:42,122
y to the y to the x--this equals wau

75
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,624
and if I make the next term take just the previous two

76
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,228
x to the y to the x to the x to the y,

77
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,364
and y to the x to the y to the y to the x,

78
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,134
this also equals wau!

79
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:56,703
And you can keep going and get these non-repeating patterns

80
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,638
related to the Fibonacci sequence.

81
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:02,718
And this will all work out to wau for any numbers x and y

82
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:05,212
where x over y is wau.

83
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,804
Yeah, wau is awesome.

84
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:10,165
You can make an equiangular spiral when you make

85
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,958
the angle phi as you go around and you get a golden spiral

86
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:16,000
Pretty straightforward. But wau is such a weird number

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,725
if you tried to make the angle wau, then the spiral

88
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:23,630
curls up infinitely on itself, collapsing and entangling

89
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,499
like a quantum string.

90
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,214
Wau, in fact, shows up in physics too.

91
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:31,671
e to the wau, divided by mc squared, is equal to

92
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,879
wau squared.

93
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,747
And wau shows up everywhere in nature.

94
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:38,221
I mean, everywhere! Every single flower

95
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:40,981
or tree you see embodies wau.

96
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,116
But instead of going on about that, I'll just give you

97
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,519
one more crazy concept.

98
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,135
Just imagine that you took a number to the power of that number

99
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:52,626
to the power of that number, all the way to infinity

100
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,395
and then beyond infinity. So far that it came back

101
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,206
and became that number's root

102
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,098
of the number's root of the number's root

103
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,411
of...all the way past infinity until it gets back

104
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:03,819
around to the beginning.

105
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,757
It's not a notion that even makes sense according to

106
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,109
standard mathematics, but if you make this number wau

107
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,751
it actually becomes possible to argue that

108
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:15,223
all this, equals one.

109
00:05:15,223 --> 99:59:59,999
What amazing properties of wau can you come up with?
