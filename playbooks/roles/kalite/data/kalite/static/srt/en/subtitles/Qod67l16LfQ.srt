1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,620
We're on problem 120.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,310
David has d books, which is 3 times as many as Jeff,

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,130
and 1/2 as many as Paula.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,170
So d is equal to 1/2 the number of books Paula has.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,720
How many books do the three of them

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,070
have together in terms of d?

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,080
So they want to know how much d plus j plus p is,

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,010
in terms of d. So what's j in terms of d?

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,000
j is equal to-- divide both sides by 3-- is equal to d/3.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,860
And what's p in terms of d?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,170
If we multiply both sides by 2, you get p is equal to 2d.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,790
So this turns into d plus j,which is d/3,plus p, which is 2d.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,080
Let's find the common denominator. Well, 3.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,600
1d is the same thing as 3d over 3.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,580
d over 3, well, that's still just going to be d/3.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,850
2d, that's the same thing is 6d over 3.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:29,160
That's equal to 3, 4, plus 6 is 10d over 3, or 10 thirds d.

18
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,670
And that's choice C. 10 thirds d.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,060
Problem 121.

20
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,710
There are 8 teams in a certain league,

21
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,420
and each team plays each of the other teams exactly once.

22
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:57,200
If each game is played by 2 teams-- it's a traditional game--

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,500
what is the total number of games played?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,080
Let's think about it a little bit.

25
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,050
They each play each other exactly once.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,090
So this turns into that grid problem that we did last time.

27
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,670
If I have 8 teams, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,700
And I'm going to write the same thing.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:33,670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

30
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,520
They can't play each other. 1 is never going to play 1.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,850
2 is never going to play 2. 3 is never going to play 3.

32
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,480
4 is never going to play 4, et cetera,

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,610
all the way down the diagonal. You can't play yourself.

34
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,810
And 1 is going to play 2 exactly 1 game. That's 1 game.

35
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,090
And we're not going to write 2 played 1,

36
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,480
because 1 already played 2. They only play each other once.

37
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,330
So you don't want to count this one down here.

38
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,010
You don't want to count this one. This is when 1 plays 3.

39
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,710
This is when 2 plays 3.So,essentially, you want to figure out

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,620
all of these spots that are above the diagonal.

41
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,580
Let's think about how many spots there are.

42
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:21,430
If we have an 8 by 8 square, there are 8 times 8 squares on

43
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,950
this grid, if I actually drew them as squares.

44
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,450
I did that a couple of problems ago.

45
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,560
If I actually drew it like that,

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,620
then you might see the grid a little bit better.

47
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,940
But I think you get the idea.

48
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,000
You have 8 by 8 spots on this grid,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,030
because it's 8 spots high,8 spots wide. So you have 64 spots.

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,050
Now, you're not going to have one of the games along the

51
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,440
diagonal, because that would be a team playing itself.

52
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,760
So how many spots are along the diagonal? There's 8.

53
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,000
There's 1 against 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,630
So that's each team playing itself.

55
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:02,020
So there's 8 spots along the diagonal. So 64 minus 8 is 56.

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,390
And so 56 would give us the number of squares that

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,610
aren't in the diagonal.

58
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,900
But if we counted all of them, we would be double counting.

59
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,000
We'd be counting 1 playing 2 up here, and 2 playing 1.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
So we only want to count half of the remaining squares.

61
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,050
So if you divide this by 2, you get 28.

62
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,030
So there'd be a total of 28 games. And that's choice C.

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,620
Question 122.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,600
An operation theta is defined by the equation a theta b is

65
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,500
equal to a minus b over a plus b for all numbers a and b

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,520
such that a does not equal minus b.

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,760
That ensures that the denominator does not equal 0.

68
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,820
So they're defining the domain.

69
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,170
If a equaled minus b, then it would be undefined,

70
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,030
because you'd have something divided by 0.

71
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:12,820
If a does not equal negative c, and a theta c is equal to 0,

72
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,970
then c is equal to-- So they're telling us right now

73
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,820
that a does not equal minus c. So let's just write it down.

74
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,440
a theta c is equal to a minus c over a plus c.

75
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,150
And then, that we want to set equal to 0.

76
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,160
Because they're telling us a theta c is equal to 0.

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,910
They're telling us that a does not equal minus c.

78
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,360
So that's essentially saying if a was minus c,

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,470
then the denominator would be 0,

80
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,580
and we would have something really strange.

81
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,320
So they are telling us the denominator does not equal 0.So if

82
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,680
the denominator does not equal 0, and this fraction equals 0,

83
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,390
then the numerator of this fraction has to be equal to 0.

84
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,780
Or another way you could say it,

85
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,100
a minus c over a plus c is equal to 0.

86
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,160
We know a plus c is not equal to 0.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,030
So let's multiply both sides of the equation times it.

88
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,760
And you get a minus c is equal to 0 times a plus c.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,690
That's just 0. In other words, if a fraction is equal 0,

90
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,100
the denominator is not 0. That would make it undefined.

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,050
Then the numerator has to be equal to 0.

92
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,430
So then, just solving, you get a is equal to c.

93
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,710
Add c to both sides. So they want to know what c is equal to.

94
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,700
So c is equal to a. And that is choice E.

95
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,050
Next question. Let me switch colors. 123.

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,580
The price of a lunch for 15 people was $207,

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,010
including a 15% gratuity for service. So that was plus 15%.

98
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:03,200
What was the average price per person,excluding the gratuity?

99
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:13,020
So essentially, we want to figure out the price of 15

100
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,640
before gratuity times-- so this is after gratuity.

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,610
So I'll call this, price before gratuity.

102
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,460
I don't want to get too complicated with my notation--

103
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,610
Price before gratuity times 1.15,

104
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,070
because we're going to increase by 15, is equal to $207.

105
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,730
So the price before gratuity of the 15 people is equal to

106
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,990
207 divided by 1.15.

107
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,690
And we want to figure out the average price per person.

108
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:56,470
So we want to figure out this divided by 15.

109
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,890
This looks, at its heart, kind kind of messy.

110
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:06,030
But let's just chug through it and see where we can go.

111
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:19,700
So this is the same thing is 207/1.15 times 1/15. And

112
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:29,000
that's equal to 207 divided by 15 times 1.15,the denominator.

113
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's figure out the denominator first.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Well, maybe the numerator-- 207 divided by 1.15.

115
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:46,000
1.15 goes into 207. Add some decimals.

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,190
Push this two to the right, two to the right.

117
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,090
The decimal goes there. 115 goes into 207 one time.

118
00:08:53,090 --> 00:09:09,010
1 times 115 is 115.Then,it's 85 plus 7. 85 plus 7 is 92. 920.

119
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:15,130
And then then this should go roughly 8 times. 8 times 115.

120
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:22,130
8 times 5 is 40. 8 times 1 is 8 plus 4 is 12. Carry the 1.

121
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,860
8 times 1 is 8, plus 1 is 9. It actually equals exactly 920.

122
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,490
Great.

123
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,040
So before gratuity, it was $180.

124
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,880
Before gratuity, our price was $180.

125
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,020
And now,we have to divide that by 15 to get the average price

126
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,080
So 15 goes into 180 how many times?

127
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,110
1 times 15, 30. 15 goes into 30 two times.

128
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,020
So the average price before gratuity was exactly $12, B.

129
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,080
And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
