1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,640
In this video, I want to
introduce you to the idea of

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:11,070
an exponential function and
really just show you how fast

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,660
these things can grow.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,340
So let's just write an example
exponential function here.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,500
So let's say we have y is equal
to 3 to the x power.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,575
Notice, this isn't x to
the third power, this

8
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:26,260
is 3 to the x power.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,240
Our independent variable x
is the actual exponent.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,660
So let's make a table here to
see how quickly this thing

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,740
grows, and maybe we'll
graph it as well.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,540
So let's take some
x values here.

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,590
Let's start with x is
equal to negative 4.

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:50,350
Then we'll go to negative 3,
negative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,370
And let's figure out what our
y-values are going to be for

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,540
each of these x-values.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,110
Now, here, y is going to be 3 to
the negative 4 power, which

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,460
is equal to 1 over 3 to
the fourth power.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,420
3 to the third is 27 times
3 again is 81.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,670
So this is equal to 1/81.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,620
When x is equal to negative
3, y is 3.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,850
We'll do this in a
different color.

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,250
This color is hard to read.

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,530
y is 3 to the negative
3 power.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,840
Well, that's 1 over 3
to the third power,

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,500
which is equal to 1/27.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,050
So we're going from a
super-small number to a less

28
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,300
super-small number.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,460
And then 3 to the negative
2 power is

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,470
going to be 1/9, right?

31
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,970
1 over 3 squared, and then we
have 3 to the 0 power, which

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,880
is just equal to 1.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,110
So we're getting a little bit
larger, a little bit larger,

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,580
but you'll see that we
are about to explode.

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,750
Now, we have 3 to
the first power.

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,370
That's equal to 3.

37
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,825
So we have 3 to the second
power, right? y is equal to 3

38
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:53,830
to the second power.

39
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,200
That's 9.

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,050
3 to the third power, 27.

41
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,820
3 to the fourth power, 81.

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,970
If we were to put the
fifth power, 243.

43
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,690
Let's graph this, just
to get an idea of how

44
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,950
quickly we're exploding.

45
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,495
Let me draw my axes here.

46
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:13,780
   

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,270
So that's my x-axis and
that is my y-axis.

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,000
   

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,400
And let me just do it in
increments of 5, because I

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,500
really want to get the general
shape of the graph here.

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,690
So let me just draw as straight
a line as I can.

52
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,600
Let's say this is 5, 10, 15.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,240
Actually, I won't get
to 81 that way.

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,250
I want to get to 81.

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,480
Well, that's good enough.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,390
Let me draw it a little
bit differently

57
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,030
than I've drawn it.

58
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,960
So let me draw it down here
because all of these values,

59
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,450
you might notice, are positive
values because I have a

60
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,130
positive base.

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,105
So let me draw it like this.

62
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:59,340
   

63
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,330
Good enough.

64
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,750
And then let's say I have 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,320
That is 80 right there.

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,500
That's 10.

67
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,790
That's 30.

68
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,860
That'll be good for
approximation.

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,150
And then let's say that
this is negative 5.

70
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,700
This is positive 5 right here.

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,842
And actually, let me stretch
it out a little bit more.

72
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:28,990
Let's say this is negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3,

73
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,140
negative 4.

74
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,830
Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4.

75
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,980
So when x is equal to 0, we're
equal to 1, right?

76
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,840
When x is equal to 0, y is equal
to 1, which is right

77
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,860
around there.

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,460
When x is equal to 1, y is equal
to 3, which is right

79
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,700
around there.

80
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,770
When x is equal to 2, y is equal
to 9, which is right

81
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,960
around there.

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,440
When x equal to 3, y is
equal to 27, which is

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,500
right around there.

84
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,790
When x is equal to 4,
y is equal to 81.

85
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,820
You see very quickly this
is just exploding.

86
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,170
If I did 5, we'd go to
243, which wouldn't

87
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,500
even fit on my screen.

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,070
When you go to negative 1, we
get smaller and smaller.

89
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,910
So at negative 1,
we're at 1/9.

90
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,430
Eventually, you're not even
going to see this.

91
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,760
It's going to get closer
and closer to zero.

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,660
As this approaches larger and
larger negative numbers, or I

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,220
guess I should say smaller
negative numbers, so 3 to the

94
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,140
negative thousand, 3 to the
negative million, we're

95
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,590
getting numbers closer and
closer to zero without

96
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,490
actually ever approaching
zero.

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,380
So as we go from negative
infinity, x is equal to

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,060
negative infinity, we're getting
very close to zero,

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,350
we're slowly getting our
way ourselves away from

100
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,810
zero, but then bam!

101
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,050
Once we start getting
into the positive

102
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,440
numbers, we just explode.

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,040
We just explode, and we
keep exploding at an

104
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,660
ever-increasing rate.

105
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,230
So the idea here is just to
show you that exponential

106
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,850
functions are really,
really dramatic.

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,240
Well, you can always construct
a faster expanding function.

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
For example, you could say y is
equal to x to the x, even

109
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,690
faster expanding, but out of the
ones that we deal with in

110
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,970
everyday life, this is one of
the fastest. So given that,

111
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,220
let's do some word problems
that just give us an

112
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,250
appreciation for exponential
functions.

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,970
So let's say that someone
sends out a chain

114
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,162
letter in week 1.

115
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:29,170
In week 1, someone sent a chain
letter to 10 people.

116
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:33,130
And the chain letter says you
have to now send this chain

117
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,775
letter to 10 more new people,
and if you don't, you're going

118
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:40,140
to have bad luck, and your hair
is going to fall out, and

119
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,350
you'll marry a frog,
or whatever else.

120
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,730
So all of these people agree and
they go and each send it

121
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,410
to 10 people the next week.

122
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,610
So in week 2, they go
out and each send

123
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,250
it to 10 more people.

124
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,330
So each of those original 10
people are each sending out 10

125
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,710
more of the letters.

126
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,860
So now 100 people have
the letters, right?

127
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,500
Each of those 10 sent
out 10, so that 100

128
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,800
letters were sent out.

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,710
   

130
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,050
10 were sent.

131
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,510
Here, 100 were sent.

132
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,570
In week 3, what's
going to happen?

133
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,260
Each of those 100 people who
got this one, they're each

134
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,730
going to send out 10, assuming
that everyone is really into

135
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,110
chain letters.

136
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,330
So 1,000 people are
going to get it.

137
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,840
And so the general pattern
here is, the people who

138
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,250
receive it, so in week n where
n is the week we're talking

139
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,920
about, how many people
received the letter?

140
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:46,960
In week n, we have 10 to the nth
people receive-- i before

141
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,080
e except after c-- the letter.

142
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,920
So if I were to ask you, how
many people are getting the

143
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,700
letter on the sixth week?

144
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,370
   

145
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,230
How many people are actually
going to receive that letter?

146
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,140
Well, what's 10 to
the sixth power?

147
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,150
10 to the sixth is equal to 1
with six zeroes, which is 1

148
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,870
million people are going to
receive that letter in just 6

149
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,250
weeks, just sending out
10 letters each.

150
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,420
And obviously, in the real
world, most people chuck these

151
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,170
in the basket, so you don't have
this good of a hit rate.

152
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,290
But if you did, if every 10
people you sent it to also

153
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,760
sent it to 10 people and so on
and so forth, by the sixth

154
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,420
week, you would have
a million people.

155
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,000
And by the ninth week, you would
have a billion people.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,610
And frankly, the week
after that, you

157
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,100
would run out of people.

158
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,250
I'll see you in the
next video.

159
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,666
