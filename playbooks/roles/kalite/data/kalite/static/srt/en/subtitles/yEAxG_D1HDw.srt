1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,097
Lets see if we can stumble our way

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:05,041
to another logrithm property

3
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,509
So lets say that

4
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:09,490
Oh, I dont know

5
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:11,945
Lets say that

6
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:20,100
log base x of A

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,407
is equal to B, right?

8
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:26,409
That's the same thing as saying

9
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,676
That's the exact same thing as saying that

10
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:37,089
x to the B is equal to A

11
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:38,515
Fair enough

12
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:45,099
What I want to do is experiment - what happens if I multiply this expression by another variable - let's call it C

13
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:50,594
Right, so I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by C

14
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,846
I'm going to switch colours just to keep things interesting

15
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,925
That's not an X that's a dot - times C

16
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:58,779
So I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by C

17
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:09,192
So I get C times log base X of A is equal to

18
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:10,761
(multiply both sides, right?)

19
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:14,177
is equal to B times C

20
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,352
Fair enough.
