1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,270
In the last video we saw, a
little bit more formally than

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,990
you might have been exposed to
the past, that a function is

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,250
just a mapping of the members
of one set to another set.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,050
So if this is my first set, x.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,580
We call that the domain.

7
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,850
And the set that we're mapping
to, y, in this case, that's

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,260
called the codomain.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,290
And the function just maps each
of the specific entries

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,230
of x to an entry in y.

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,030
When I say map, it really just
creates an association.

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,580
If we think of these in even
less abstract terms -- which,

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,395
on some levels is more abstract
-- you could view x

14
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:40,150
as a basket of bananas and
y as a basket of apples.

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,330
And for every banana, you're
associating it

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,030
with one of the apples.

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,130
   

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,130
The mapping of going from each
of those bananas to each of

19
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,490
those apples would
be a function.

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,520
I don't know if that helps you
or not, but I just want to

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,810
broaden your preconceived notion
of what a function is.

22
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,280
I mean everything that you've
probably seen before probably

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,720
took a form that looks
something like that.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,810
Where you said, oh, a function
is, you just give me some

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,600
number and I'll give
you another number.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
Or I'll do something
to that number.

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,230
While it can be much more
general than that.

28
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,980
It's an association between any
member of one set and some

29
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,890
other members of another set.

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,190
Now, we know that vectors
are members of sets.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,210
Right?

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:28,970
In particular, if we say that
some vector x is a member of

33
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,440
some set -- let me just say it's
a member of rn, because

34
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,390
that's what we deal with -- all
that means is that this is

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,220
just a particular representation
of an n-tuple.

36
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,680
Remember what rn was.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,150
rn we defined way back at the
beginning of the linear

38
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,482
algebra playlist. We defined it
as the set of all n-tuples

39
00:01:50,482 --> 00:02:03,370
-- x1, x2, xn, where your x1's,
x2's, all the way to

40
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,600
xn's are a member of
the real numbers.

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,880
So your rn is most
definitely a set.

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,120
This could be rn.

43
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,550
And obviously the use of the
letter n is arbitrary.

44
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,510
It could be rm, it
could be rs.

45
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,200
n is just kind of a placeholder
for how many

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,990
tuples we have. It
could be r5.

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,790
It could be 5 tuples.

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,990
And when we say that a vector
x is a member of rn, we're

49
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,370
just saying that it's another
way of writing

50
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,680
one of these n-tuples.

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,440
And all of our vectors so far
are column vectors -- that's

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,830
the only type that we've defined
so far -- and we say

53
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,820
it's this ordered list where
each of the members are a

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,505
member of r's.

55
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,770
It's an ordered list of n --
it's an ordered list of

56
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,540
n-components -- x1, x2, all the
way to xn -- where each of

57
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,440
those guys, or each of those
x1's, x2's all the way to

58
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,130
xn's, are a member of
the real numbers.

59
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,890
That's, by definition, what we
mean when we say that x is a

60
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,480
member of rn.

61
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,840
So if x is a member of rn -- so
let me draw two sets right

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,590
here -- let's say that this set
right here is rn and then

63
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,890
let me just change, just to be
general, let me create another

64
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,120
set right there and call that
set right there rm.

65
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,250
Just a different number.

66
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,200
It it could be the same as
n, it could be different.

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,900
This is m-tuples,
that's n-tuples.

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,520
   

69
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,540
We've defined that vectors
can be members of rn.

70
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,930
So you could have some vector
here and then, if you

71
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,430
associate with that vector in rn
-- if you associate it with

72
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:47,790
some vector in are rm -- if you
associate it with, let's

73
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,550
call that vector y, if you make
this association, that

74
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,120
too is a function.

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,480
And that might have already been
obvious to you and this

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,885
would be a function that's
mapping from rn to rm.

77
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:06,430
And actually, I just want
to make one little

78
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,080
special note here.

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
When I just drew the arrow like
this, this shows that I'm

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,280
mapping between two sets.

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm taking elements of this set
and I'm associating with

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,060
them with elements
of that set.

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,690
Now, in the last video you
probably saw this.

84
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,550
I wanted to do the side note
note because I realized it

85
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,910
might've been confusing.

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,330
I introduced you to another
way of writing a

87
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,615
function like this.

88
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:28,330
Where I said f could be defined
as a mapping for any

89
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,480
given x to x squared.

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,960
And I just want to make a
note on the notation.

91
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,860
When I just have a regular arrow
I'm going between sets.

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,100
When I have this little vertical
line at the base of

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,860
the arrow, that's kind of
the function definition.

94
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,060
It tells me for any x you give
me in the first set, in the

95
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,560
second set I'm going to
associate this x with, in this

96
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,530
case, x squared.

97
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,210
Anyway, I just wanted to
make that side note.

98
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,580
But the whole direction I was
going in is that vectors are

99
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,220
valid elements of sets,
functions are just mappings

100
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,300
between elements of sets,
so you could have

101
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,540
functions of vectors.

102
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,000
And I even touched on that a
little bit in the last video

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
when I talked about
vector-valued functions.

104
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:25,080
If your codomain is a subset of
rm, where m is greater than

105
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,600
1, then we say your function
is vector-valued.

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,910
It's not just mapping into
the real numbers.

107
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,080
It's mapping into some m-tuple
of real numbers.

108
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,670
So if you mapped two-dimensional
space, you're

109
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,325
dealing with a vector-valued
function.

110
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:44,140
Now I've been all abstract and
whatnot, so let me actually

111
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,290
deal with some vectors and it
might make everything a little

112
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,540
bit more concrete.

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:06:00,620
So let's say I define the
function f as f of x1, x2, and

114
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:13,440
x3, is equal to x1 plus
2x2 and the second

115
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,740
coordinate is just 3x3.

116
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,480
And actually, I haven't formally
defined coordinates

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,440
for you yet, but I think you
understand that just from your

118
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
basic algebra training.

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,060
So let's say that that's my
function definition based on

120
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,000
the notation that we've
been introduced to.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,660
We could say that f is a mapping
from -- its domain is

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,470
r3 -- and it maps from r3, or it
associates all values in r3

123
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,960
with some value in r2.

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,210
This is a 2-tuple.

125
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,420
   

126
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,760
Right?

127
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,040
So this is an r2 This
is 3-tuple.

128
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,310
   

129
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,730
Right?

130
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,750
Or another way we could do this,
if we just wanted to

131
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,170
write it in vector notation, I
could write that f -- if you

132
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:10,610
pass f to some vector x1, x2,
x3, I could say this will be

133
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,550
equal to the vector -- and
now it's going to have a

134
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,640
two-component vector.

135
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,050
It's going to be a vector in r2
where the first term is x1

136
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,320
plus 2x2 and the second
term is 3x3.

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,810
So let's play around with
this a little bit.

138
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,010
See what it does for us, what
it does to the vectors.

139
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:39,280
So what is f of the
vector 1, 1, 1?

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,890
Well, I get 1 plus 2 times 1
is, I get the vector 3, and

141
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,860
then my second term is just 3
times this one, so I get the

142
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,690
vector 3, 3.

143
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,040
Fair enough, let me
do another one.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,850
Just to really experiment
with this mapping.

145
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:09,490
If I take the f of the vector in
r3 2, 4, 1, what do I get?

146
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,330
That equals 2 plus 2 times 4.

147
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,840
That goes to the vector 10.

148
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,570
2 plus 2 times 4 and
then 3 times the

149
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,720
third term right there.

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,670
So the vector 10, 3.

151
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,630
So how can we visualize this?

152
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,220
Well, three-dimensional vectors
-- or vectors in r3 --

153
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,240
are not always the easiest to
visualize, but I think we can

154
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,784
attempt to visualize
these two guys.

155
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:45,090
   

156
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,030
So let's say that this is the
x1-axis, that's the x2-axis,

157
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,160
that's the x3-axis.

158
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,650
So this first vector right here,
this yellow one, 1, 1,

159
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,090
1, it will look like
this -- 1, 1, 1.

160
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,210
And so if I were to go out here,
then go out here, then

161
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,170
go up 1, the point would be
right there and if I were to

162
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,790
draw it in standard position,
I'd start at the origin, and

163
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,940
the vector looks something
like that.

164
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,250
And then the second guy, 2, 4,
1, it would look like this.

165
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,630
It would go 2 out here,
we'd go 4 this

166
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,790
direction, 1, 2, 3, 4.

167
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,070
And then we'd go 1 up.

168
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,350
So it looks something
like this.

169
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,330
2, 4, 1.

170
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,970
I think you get the idea.

171
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,680
So I've drawn these two vectors
that are essentially

172
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,970
in my domain.

173
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,380
Our domain is r3.

174
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,370
This is our r3 right here.

175
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,350
And let's see what
our function maps

176
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,980
these vectors to.

177
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,510
So what's our codomain?

178
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,110
Our codomain is r2, so this
is much easier to

179
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,880
visualize for us.

180
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,320
So we just have to draw
two axes like this.

181
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,420
Let's call this x1 and
let's call this x2.

182
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,650
And so what does f of 1, 1, 1 --
of this yellow vector -- it

183
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,540
becomes 3, 3.

184
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:12,010
So if I do it in yellow,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

185
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,360
So it gets me this one.

186
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,370
If I draw it in standard
position the

187
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,070
vector looks like this.

188
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,110
So, literally, our function
went from mapped from this

189
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,250
vector in r3 to this
vector in r2.

190
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,560
That was what our
function did.

191
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,870
Likewise, if we take the other
vector, we went from this 2,

192
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,860
4, 1 vector to sector 10, 3.

193
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,970
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

194
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,410
So it's going to look
something like this.

195
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,180
And it's going to be 3 up,
so it's going to look

196
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,480
something like this.

197
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,000
So this vector right here, by
our function, f, got mapped --

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,610
let me do a different color
-- to this vector.

199
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,700
This vector right here in r3 got
mapped to this vector in

200
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,620
r2 by our function.

201
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,230
Now this is just a switch
of terminology.

202
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,060
When we talk about functions
of vectors the term that we

203
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,700
tend to use is the word
transformation.

204
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,000
   

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,600
But it really is the exact
same thing as a function.

206
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,340
I don't want to confuse you,
because if you watch the

207
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,990
differential equations playlist,
you saw the idea of

208
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,440
a Laplace transformation, which
is really an operation

209
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,500
that takes a function
as an argument.

210
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,550
But in this case, and when
we're dealing into linear

211
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,270
algebra world, a transformation
is really just

212
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,180
a function operating on vectors
-- or the way we're

213
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,330
going to use it -- it's just a
function operating on vectors.

214
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:46,080
   

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,640
And so the general notation,
instead of writing a lowercase

216
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,670
f like that, for a function,
people use an uppercase T to

217
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,850
say it's a transformation.

218
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,330
Although it doesn't have
to be an uppercase T.

219
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,210
But that's the one that people
use the most. Just like this

220
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,160
could be a g or an h,
but people always

221
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,300
use a lowercase f.

222
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,920
So the same way we could have
written this, we could have

223
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,260
called this a transformation.

224
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,210
And my sense of why, in the
linear algebra world, they use

225
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,150
this, is because you kind of
imagine that this vector is

226
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,100
being changed into
that vector.

227
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,370
Or that this is vector is being

228
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,610
transformed into that vector.

229
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,210
I think that's why they call it
a transformation as opposed

230
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,760
to a function.

231
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,340
And it actually makes a lot
more sense when you start

232
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,870
going into things like video
game programming.

233
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,630
And a lot of what we're
embarking on with our

234
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,360
transformations is key to
video game programming.

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,860
But you're kind of transforming
one image into

236
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,030
another image if you're viewing
at it from a different

237
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,030
angle or whatever else
you might want to do.

238
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,850
We'll talk a lot more about
that in the future.

239
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,320
But I just wanted to introduce
you to this notation.

240
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,570
So these statements, I could
have replaced all my f's with

241
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,010
T's and I could have defined
some transformation.

242
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,030
And I just want to make you
comfortable the notation.

243
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,200
I could have defined it
similarly, a transformation

244
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:11,510
from r3 to r2 and I could have
said that T of x1, x2, x3 is

245
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:21,460
equal to the 2-tuple x1 plus 2
x1 comma 3x3 And I could have,

246
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,250
just as similarly put a T up
here because I have defined it

247
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,150
the same way.

248
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,990
I could have said T of
my vector 1, 1, 1

249
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,210
is equal to 3, 3.

250
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,960
Now, you might say, hey Sal, why
are you going through all

251
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,050
this trouble of replacing
T's with f's?

252
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,800
I'm just doing this so you
don't get confused.

253
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,300
So that when you see in your
linear algebra book, when you

254
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
see linear algebra problems,
when you see this big capital

255
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,940
T and you're like, wow, I've
never seen that before and

256
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,180
they're using this fancy word
called a transformation.

257
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,890
This is completely identical to
your notion of a function.

258
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,540
It is a function.

259
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,130
In the next video I'm going
to talk about linear

260
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,230
transformations.

261
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,190
That's really just
linear functions.

262
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,820
And I'll define that
a little bit more

263
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,450
precisely in the next video.

264
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,390
But hopefully by watching this
video you at least have a

265
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,945
sense that you can apply
functions to vectors and, in

266
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,360
the linear algebra world,
we tend to call those

267
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,270
transformations.

268
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,670
And hopefully this example
right here gives you, at

269
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,080
least, a visual representation
of why it's called a

270
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,760
transformation.

271
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,250
We're transforming from
one vector to another.
