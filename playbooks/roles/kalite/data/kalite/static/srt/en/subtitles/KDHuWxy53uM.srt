1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,510
Let's learn a little bit
about the dot product.

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,040
The dot product, frankly, out of
the two ways of multiplying

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,410
vectors, I think is
the easier one.

5
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,820
So what does the
dot product do?

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,406
Why don't I give you the
definition, and then I'll give

7
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:12,080
you an intuition.

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:23,960
So if I have two vectors; vector
a dot vector b-- that's

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,660
how I draw my arrows.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,300
I can draw my arrows
like that.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,940
That is equal to the magnitude
of vector a times the

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,610
magnitude of vector b
times cosine of the

13
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,430
angle between them.

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,520
Now where does this come from?

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,480
This might seem a little
arbitrary, but I think with a

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,500
visual explanation, it will make
a little bit more sense.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,850
So let me draw, arbitrarily,
these two vectors.

18
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,060
So that is my vector a-- nice
big and fat vector.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,710
It's good for showing
the point.

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,810
And let me draw vector
b like that.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,350
   

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,380
Vector b.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,180
And then let me draw the cosine,
or let me, at least,

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,650
draw the angle between them.

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,090
This is theta.

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,650
So there's two ways
of view this.

27
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,600
Let me label them.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,886
This is vector a.

29
00:01:14,886 --> 00:01:17,010
I'm trying to be color
consistent.

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,740
This is vector b.

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,120
So there's two ways of
viewing this product.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,360
You could view it as vector a--
because multiplication is

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,130
associative, you could
switch the order.

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,400
So this could also be written
as, the magnitude of vector a

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,200
times cosine of theta, times--
and I'll do it in color

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,700
appropriate-- vector b.

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,300
And this times, this
is the dot product.

38
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,470
I almost don't have
to write it.

39
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,860
This is just regular
multiplication, because these

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,200
are all scalar quantities.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,300
When you see the dot between
vectors, you're talking about

42
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,550
the vector dot product.

43
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,640
So if we were to just rearrange
this expression this

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,410
way, what does it mean?

45
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,110
What is a cosine of theta?

46
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,180
Let me ask you a question.

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,970
If I were to drop a right
angle, right here,

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:06,740
perpendicular to b-- so let's
just drop a right angle

49
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,900
there-- cosine of theta
soh-coh-toa so, cah cosine--

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,260
is equal to adjacent of
a hypotenuse, right?

51
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,990
Well, what's the adjacent?

52
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,540
It's equal to this.

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,900
And the hypotenuse is equal to
the magnitude of a, right?

54
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,740
Let me re-write that.

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,230
So cosine of theta-- and this
applies to the a vector.

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,270
Cosine of theta of this angle
is equal to ajacent, which

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,800
is-- I don't know what you could
call this-- let's call

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,130
this the projection
of a onto b.

59
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,890
It's like if you were to shine
a light perpendicular to b--

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,080
if there was a light source
here and the light was

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
straight down, it would be
the shadow of a onto b.

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,110
Or you could almost think of it
as the part of a that goes

63
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,440
in the same direction of b.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,340
So this projection, they call
it-- at least the way I get

65
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,050
the intuition of what a
projection is, I kind of view

66
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,910
it as a shadow.

67
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,480
If you had a light source that
came up perpendicular, what

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,590
would be the shadow of that
vector on to this one?

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,260
So if you think about it, this
shadow right here-- you could

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,240
call that, the projection
of a onto b.

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,180
Or, I don't know.

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,200
Let's just call it, a sub b.

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,240
And it's the magnitude
of it, right?

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,520
It's how much of vector a goes
on vector b over-- that's the

75
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,650
adjacent side-- over
the hypotenuse.

76
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,790
The hypotenuse is just the
magnitude of vector a.

77
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,810
It's just our basic calculus.

78
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,500
Or another way you could view
it, just multiply both sides

79
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,190
by the magnitude of vector a.

80
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,390
You get the projection of a onto
b, which is just a fancy

81
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,830
way of saying, this side; the
part of a that goes in the

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,750
same direction as b-- is another
way to say it-- is

83
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,590
equal to just multiplying both
sides times the magnitude of a

84
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,240
is equal to the magnitude
of a, cosine of theta.

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,430
Which is exactly what
we have up here.

86
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,570
And the definition of
the dot product.

87
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,860
So another way of visualizing
the dot product is, you could

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,570
replace this term with the
magnitude of the projection of

89
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,760
a onto b-- which is just
this-- times the

90
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,870
magnitude of b.

91
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,360
That's interesting.

92
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,410
All the dot product of two
vectors is-- let's just take

93
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,650
one vector.

94
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,720
Let's figure out how much of
that vector-- what component

95
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,650
of it's magnitude-- goes in
the same direction as the

96
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,570
other vector, and let's
just multiply them.

97
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,250
And where is that useful?

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,040
Well, think about it.

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,020
What about work?

100
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,720
When we learned work
in physics?

101
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,870
Work is force times distance.

102
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,600
But it's not just
the total force

103
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,460
times the total distance.

104
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,110
It's the force going
in the same

105
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,360
direction as the distance.

106
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,030
   

107
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,320
You should review the physics
playlist if you're watching

108
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,150
this within the calculus
playlist. Let's say I have a

109
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,250
10 newton object.

110
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,710
It's sitting on ice, so
there's no friction.

111
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,920
We don't want to worry about
fiction right now.

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,915
And let's say I pull on it.

113
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:20,485
Let's say my force vector--
This is my force vector.

114
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:25,540
   

115
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:34,440
Let's say my force vector
is 100 newtons.

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,910
I'm making the numbers up.

117
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,250
100 newtons.

118
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,940
And Let's say I slide it to
the right, so my distance

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:54,720
vector is 10 meters parallel
to the ground.

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,910
   

121
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,820
And the angle between them is
equal to 60 degrees, which is

122
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,080
the same thing is pi over 3.

123
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,125
We'll stick to degrees.

124
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,790
It's a little bit
more intuitive.

125
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,660
It's 60 degrees.

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,940
This distance right
here is 10 meters.

127
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,550
So my question is, by pulling on
this rope, or whatever, at

128
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,360
the 60 degree angle, with a
force of 100 newtons, and

129
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,980
pulling this block to the right
for 10 meters, how much

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,560
work am I doing?

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,990
Well, work is force times the
distance, but not just the

132
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,890
total force.

133
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,880
The magnitude of the force in
the direction of the distance.

134
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,150
So what's the magnitude
of the force in the

135
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,590
direction of the distance?

136
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,730
It would be the horizontal
component of this force

137
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,690
vector, right?

138
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,110
So it would be 100
newtons times the

139
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,520
cosine of 60 degrees.

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,620
It will tell you how
much of that 100

141
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,180
newtons goes to the right.

142
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,540
Or another way you could
view it if this

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,390
is the force vector.

144
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,110
And this down here is
the distance vector.

145
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,710
You could say that the total
work you performed is equal to

146
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,350
the force vector dot the
distance vector, using the dot

147
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,940
product-- taking the dot
product, to the force and the

148
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,650
distance factor.

149
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,930
And we know that the definition
is the magnitude of

150
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,700
the force vector, which is 100
newtons, times the magnitude

151
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,880
of the distance vector, which is
10 meters, times the cosine

152
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,990
of the angle between them.

153
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,030
Cosine of the angle
is 60 degrees.

154
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,890
So that's equal to 1,000
newton meters

155
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,010
times cosine of 60.

156
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,410
Cosine of 60 is what?

157
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,510
It's square root of 3 over 2.

158
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,690
   

159
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,040
Square root of 3 over 2, if
I remember correctly.

160
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,750
So times the square
root of 3 over 2.

161
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,290
So the 2 becomes 500.

162
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,160
So it becomes 500 square roots
of 3 joules, whatever that is.

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,990
I don't know 700 something,
I'm guessing.

164
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,960
Maybe it's 800 something.

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm not quite sure.

166
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,950
But the important thing to
realize is that the dot

167
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,010
product is useful.

168
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,880
It applies to work.

169
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,230
It actually calculates what
component of what vector goes

170
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,280
in the other direction.

171
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,400
Now you could interpret
it the other way.

172
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,190
You could say this is
the magnitude of a

173
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,500
times b cosine of theta.

174
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,110
And that's completely valid.

175
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,370
And what's b cosine of theta?

176
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,920
Well, if you took b cosine of
theta, and you could work this

177
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,370
out as an exercise for yourself,
that's the amount of

178
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,020
the magnitude of the
b vector that's

179
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,580
going in the a direction.

180
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,630
So it doesn't matter
what order you go.

181
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,520
So when you take the cross
product, it matters whether

182
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,680
you do a cross b,
or b cross a.

183
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,980
But when you're doing the dot
product, it doesn't matter

184
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,740
what order.

185
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,049
So b cosine theta would be the
magnitude of vector b that

186
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,570
goes in the direction of a.

187
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,810
So if you were to draw a
perpendicular line here, b

188
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,455
cosine theta would
be this vector.

189
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,030
   

190
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,660
That would be b cosine theta.

191
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,590
The magnitude of
b cosine theta.

192
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,090
So you could say how much of
vector b goes in the same

193
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,820
direction as a?

194
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,730
Then multiply the
two magnitudes.

195
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,460
Or you could say how much of
vector a goes in the same

196
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,680
direction is vector b?

197
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,970
And then multiply the
two magnitudes.

198
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,410
And now, this is, I think, a
good time to just make sure

199
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,590
you understand the difference
between the dot product and

200
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,240
the cross product.

201
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,200
The dot product ends up
with just a number.

202
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,280
You multiply two vectors and
all you have is a number.

203
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,990
You end up with just
a scalar quantity.

204
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,950
And why is that interesting?

205
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,610
Well, it tells you how much do
these-- you could almost say--

206
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,280
these vectors reinforce
each other.

207
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,330
Because you're taking the parts
of their magnitudes that

208
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,305
go in the same direction
and multiplying them.

209
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:42,420
The cross product is actually
almost the opposite.

210
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,110
You're taking their orthogonal
components, right?

211
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,390
The difference was, this
was a a sine of theta.

212
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,110
I don't want to mess you up
this picture too much.

213
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,460
But you should review the
cross product videos.

214
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,020
And I'll do another video where
I actually compare and

215
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,880
contrast them.

216
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,240
But the cross product is, you're
saying, let's multiply

217
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,820
the magnitudes of the vectors
that are perpendicular to each

218
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,660
other, that aren't going in the
same direction, that are

219
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,380
actually orthogonal
to each other.

220
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,770
And then, you have to pick a
direction since you're not

221
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,230
saying, well, the same
direction that

222
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,570
they're both going in.

223
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,060
So you're picking the direction
that's orthogonal to

224
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,150
both vectors.

225
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,813
And then, that's why the
orientation matters and you

226
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,370
have to take the right hand
rule, because there's actually

227
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,190
two vectors that are
perpendicular to any other two

228
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,810
vectors in three dimensions.

229
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,380
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

230
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,750
I'll continue this, hopefully
not too confusing, discussion

231
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,330
in the next video.

232
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,730
I'll compare and contrast
the cross

233
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,260
product and the dot product.

234
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,070
See you in the next video.

235
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,500
