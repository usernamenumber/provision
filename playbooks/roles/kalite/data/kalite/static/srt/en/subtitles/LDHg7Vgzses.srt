1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,740
In the last video we talked
about how every atom really

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,280
wants to have eight-- let me
write that down-- eight

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,030
electrons in its outermost
shell.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,510
This is kind of the most stable
configuration that an

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,740
electron can have. And given
this fact that's been

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,180
determined just by observing
the world, really, we can

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,420
start to figure out what's
likely to happen in different

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,350
groups of the periodic table.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,820
A group of a periodic table
is just a column of

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,220
the periodic table.

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,479
Like this group, right here, and
actually I'll start with

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,960
this group, because it's
got a special name.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,160
This group right here is
called the noble gases.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,860
And what's common when you
go down a group in

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,900
the periodic table?

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,970
What's common about a column
in the periodic table?

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,100
Well, in the last video we saw
that every element in a column

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,700
has the same number of
valence electrons.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,220
Or it has the same number
of electrons in

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,580
its outermost shell.

21
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,000
And we figured out
what that was.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,160
This column, right here, which
we learned were the alkali

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,830
metals, this has one electron
in its outermost shell.

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,530
And I made that one caveat
that hydrogen isn't

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,830
necessarily considered
an alkali metal.

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,230
One, it's usually not
in metal form.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,320
And it doesn't want to give
away electrons as much as

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,490
other metals do.

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,080
When people talk about
metal-like characteristics of

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,160
an element, they're really
talking about how likely it is

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,640
to give away electron.

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,460
We'll talk about other
characteristics of a metal,

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,020
especially the way that we
perceive metals as being

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,610
shiny, and maybe they conduct
electricity, and see how that

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,060
plays out in the
periodic table.

36
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,760
But anyway, back to what
I was talking about.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,610
This column, right here,
this is called the

38
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,680
alkaline earth metals.

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,420
So this is alkaline earth.

40
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,340
These all have two atoms
in its outermost shell.

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,450
So remember, everyone wants
to get to eight.

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,070
If these guys wanted to get to
eight by adding electrons,

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,130
they would have a
long way to go.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,570
This way, we would have to
add seven electrons.

45
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,850
They would have to add
six electrons.

46
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,340
And who are they going
to take it from?

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,090
Because these guys don't want to
give away their electrons.

48
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,860
They're so close to
getting to eight.

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,980
So it's much easier when you're
on the left-hand side

50
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,350
of the periodic table to
give away electrons.

51
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,120
In fact, when you only have one
to give away-- especially

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,150
in the case of elements other
than hydrogen-- when you only

53
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,980
have one to give away, it
really wants to do that.

54
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,330
And because of that, these
elements right here are very

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,440
seldom found in their
elemental state.

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,900
When I say elemental state, it
means there's nothing but

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,730
lithium there, there's nothing
but sodium there, there's

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,950
nothing but potassium there.

59
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,610
They're very likely, if you
find this, it's probably

60
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,530
already reacted with
something.

61
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,470
Probably with something on
this side of the periodic

62
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,520
table, because this wants to
give away something really

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,150
bad, this wants to take
something really bad.

64
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,340
So the reaction will
probably happen.

65
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
These are still reactive.

66
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,200
The alkaline earth metals are
still reactive, but not as

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,160
reactive as the alkali metals.

68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,090
And that's because these guys
are really close to getting to

69
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,840
the stable magic eight number.

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,210
These guys are a little
bit further away.

71
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,420
So it takes a little bit more,
I guess you could say, of a

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,670
push for them to
give away two.

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,820
These guys only have
to give away one.

74
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,485
And then we learned that
this has two in

75
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:20,440
its outermost shell.

76
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,140
And then all of these elements,
which are called the

77
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,710
transition metals, as you add
electrons, they're just

78
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,410
backfilling the previous
shell's d subshell.

79
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:31,940
Right?

80
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,920
So their outermost shell
still has two.

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,660
It still has those.

82
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,300
If this is the fourth period,
all of these elements'

83
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,460
outermost shell has 4s2.

84
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,560
And these elements are just
backfilling their 3d

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
suborbital.

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,950
Or their 3d subshell.

87
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,690
These are 2's.

88
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,400
So these all have two
outermost electrons.

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,190
So all of these, like the
alkaline earth metals, need to

90
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,320
lose two electrons in order to,
quote-unquote, be happy.

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,410
And the way I think about this,
and this is really just

92
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,810
a way-- and it maybe it bears
out in physical reality-- is

93
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,870
that these guys have kind of
a deep bench of electrons.

94
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,649
That if they are able to shed
some of these valence

95
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,580
electrons-- so if I write iron
has two valence electrons like

96
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,890
that-- even if they shed these
electrons, they kind of have a

97
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,660
reserve of electrons in
the d subshell for

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,420
the previous shell.

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,980
So if it sheds its 4s2
electrons, it still has all

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,740
those 3d electrons that have a
high energy state that can

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,650
maybe kind of replace them.

102
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,930
And I'll use everything in
quotation marks, because these

103
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,770
are just ways for me to
visualize things.

104
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,010
And the reason why I make that
point is because metals are

105
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,020
just very giving with
their electrons.

106
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,380
And these guys react.

107
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,780
They say, hey, take
my electrons.

108
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,680
These guys say, take these
two electrons.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,680
And these guys, they start to
say, especially as you fill

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,260
the d subshell, I've got these
two electrons, and not only do

111
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,420
I have those two electrons,
but I have more electrons

112
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,520
where-- well almost where--
that came from.

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,050
I have some in reserve
in my d.

114
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,690
And what happens in these
transition metals, and it

115
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,470
especially happens in the
metals-- so these are the

116
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,110
metals right here, and these
don't follow just a group, but

117
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,960
this is the metals, this color
right here-- is that they have

118
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,940
so many electrons to hand off,
not only do they have these

119
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,370
extra there, but they filled
their d subshell, that they

120
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,660
can kind of, especially when
they're in elemental form, and

121
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,820
when I say elemental form, this
means that you just have

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,450
a big block of aluminum.

123
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,700
Aluminum hasn't reacted with
anything like oxygen.

124
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,500
It's just a bunch of aluminum.

125
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:47,810
Right?

126
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,640
When you have a bunch of
aluminum, what happens is you

127
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,840
have these metallic bonds where
all of the aluminum

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,550
atoms say, you know what, I have
all these extra, I have

129
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,525
definitely, in the case of
aluminum, three electrons in

130
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,470
my outermost shell.

131
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,840
But I have all of these kind of
backfilled electrons in my

132
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
d suborbital.

133
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm just going to share them
with the other aluminum atoms.

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,170
So you create this sea of
aluminum atoms. And they're

135
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,430
attracted to each other.

136
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,750
Or you create this sea of
aluminum electrons.

137
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:20,090
So you have a bunch of electrons
sitting in between

138
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,620
the atoms, and since the atoms
kind of donated these

139
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,270
electrons, they're attracted
to them.

140
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,950
Right?

141
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,030
So the actual atoms-- so this
would be an aluminum plus, and

142
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,405
maybe we would have donated
three electrons.

143
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,470
But I'm not being exact here.

144
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,410
I want to just give you the
sense of how things work.

145
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,320
And that's why metals conduct
really well, because

146
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,320
electricity is just a bunch of
electrons moving, and in order

147
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,460
to have electrons moving, you
have to have surplus electrons

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,330
lying around.

149
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,480
So elements right around this
area are really good

150
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,980
conductors.

151
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,650
In fact, silver is the
best conductor.

152
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,240
Silver, right here, is the best
conductor on the planet.

153
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,440
And the reason why that's not
used for our wiring and copper

154
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,300
is because copper is easier
to find than silver.

155
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,140
But silver is the
best conductor.

156
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,340
And the way I think about it
is that these-- once you've

157
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,010
filled an orbital, that orbital

158
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,890
becomes somewhat stable.

159
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,140
So all of these guys have
filled their d orbital.

160
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,960
While these guys, their d
orbital is not filled.

161
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,910
So they just have a lot of
surplus electrons that are

162
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,970
really good for conduction.

163
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,120
Now, that's just an intuition.

164
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
I haven't done the experiment
to prove that.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
But it'll give you a
sense of why things

166
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
conduct and all of that.

167
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,370
So these are the transition
metals.

168
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,870
These are actually considered
the metals.

169
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,940
But the reason why these are
considered the transition

170
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,960
metals is because they're
filling the d-block.

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,600
But transition metals kind
of sound like not

172
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,390
as good as a metal.

173
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,460
But when I think of metals,
iron is kind of the first

174
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,610
metal I always think of.

175
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,020
I definitely think of silver and
copper and gold as metals.

176
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,270
So to call them transition
metals is a little not fair.

177
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,120
I don't really consider aluminum
more of a metal than,

178
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,230
let's say, iron is.

179
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,140
But in chemistry classification
world, aluminum

180
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,370
is more of a metal.

181
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,880
These elements right here.

182
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,700
And I know I dropped off come
from kind of the group notion.

183
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,280
But let me just actually write
the valence electrons.

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,220
So these all have three
valence electrons.

185
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,720
Four, five, six, seven.

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,680
So these all have three
electrons in

187
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,150
its outermost shell.

188
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,420
It still seems easier for them
to give them away than to take

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,990
them, but maybe now, in certain
cases, there could be,

190
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,910
especially in the case of, let's
say, boron, there could

191
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,180
be a situation where it maybe
could gain five electrons,

192
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,820
although that seems hard.

193
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,090
It's much easier to give away
three and that's why a lot of

194
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,470
the, quote-unquote,
official metals

195
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,340
show up in this category.

196
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,230
And as you can see, as you go
down the periodic table you

197
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,480
can kind of have metals
that have more and

198
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,650
more valence electrons.

199
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,730
So for, let's say, lead.

200
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,120
It's still a metal,
even though it has

201
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,690
four valence electrons.

202
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:00,490
And that's because the atom is
so big, its radius is so large

203
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,030
that the outermost shell is so
far away from the nucleus,

204
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,150
that those electrons are
easier to take off.

205
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,510
So for example, as you go down,
carbon, those electrons

206
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,470
are very close to the nucleus.

207
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,820
So they're very hard
to take off.

208
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,290
So carbon would probably more
likely gain electrons from

209
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,840
somebody else to get to eight.

210
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,270
While these guys' valence
electrons are so far away from

211
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,070
the nucleus that they're more
likely to kind of want to get

212
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,440
rid of them to get to eight and
get back to an electron

213
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,960
configuration of, let's
say, xenon.

214
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,260
And you go and then these
guys are the nonmetals.

215
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,600
Right?

216
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,560
They're likely to probably gain

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,330
electrons in most reactions.

218
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,820
And then this yellow category
that I said was highly

219
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,720
reactive, especially highly
reactive with the alkali

220
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,030
metals over here, these
are called halogens.

221
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,620
And you've probably heard
the word before.

222
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,870
Halogen lamps.

223
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,930
That's no mistake there to
call them halogen lamps.

224
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,070
That's not a random
choice of words.

225
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,560
Maybe I'll do a video on halogen
lamps in the future.

226
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,260
And then finally, we're
at the noble gases.

227
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,760
What's interesting about
the noble gases?

228
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
Well they have eight
electrons in their

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,540
outermost shell, right?

230
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,220
Except for helium.

231
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,850
Helium has two, right?

232
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,010
Helium's electron configuration
is 1s2.

233
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,250
But all of these other guys,
this guy's electron

234
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,290
configuration is 1s2.

235
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,040
This is neon.

236
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,050
1s2, 2s2, 2p6.

237
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,510
So he has eight electrons
in his outermost shell.

238
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,370
So he's happy.

239
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,960
Argon, same thing.

240
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,010
The outermost shell will
look like 3s2, 3p6.

241
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,050
Krypton will have in
its outermost shell

242
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,000
will be 3s2, 3p6.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,750
It will also have some 3d
electrons around as it

244
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,840
backfilled back here.

245
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,070
But all of these have eight
in its outermost shell, so

246
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,000
they're happy.

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
They have no incentive
to react.

248
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,700
They're kind of like, hey, all
of you other elements, just,

249
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,720
you know, you guys can do all
that crazy reactions that

250
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
you've got to do,
but we're happy.

251
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,850
And we don't want to give
or take electrons.

252
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,130
And because of that these guys
are highly, highly unreactive.

253
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,460
Very, very unreactive.

254
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,550
And you know, back in the day,
when they used to make these

255
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,150
kind of zeppelins, these big
blimps-- the Hindenburg is a

256
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,290
famous example-- they
used hydrogen.

257
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,380
And obviously hydrogen is a
pretty reactive substance.

258
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,560
It's actually very combustible
and that's why it blows up

259
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,630
very fast. And that's why now,
clowns or children's balloon

260
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,930
manufacturers, they instead
would prefer to use helium.

261
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,840
Because helium is a noble gas
and it's very unreactive.

262
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,150
And it's very unlikely
to explode at a

263
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,790
child's birthday party.

264
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,300
But anyway, I think I'm done
now with this video.

265
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,780
And in the next video we'll talk
a little bit more about

266
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,820
trends across the
periodic table.
