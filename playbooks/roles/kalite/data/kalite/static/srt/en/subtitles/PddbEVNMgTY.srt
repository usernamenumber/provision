Hey everybody, Lebron here. Got another quick brain teaser for you

2
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:12,933
Do I have better odds of making three free throws in a row or one three pointer

3
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,717
Heres my friend Sal with the answer.

4
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:21,451
Excellent question Lebron, but before I answer, I want to point out an interesting trend related to

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:25,119
your question that I just "Dug up". It's from the New York Times

6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,167
October 2009 so it's a couple of years old but it's really interesting

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It shows that since three pointers were first introduced

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They were first introduced in the 1979-1980 season

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the three pointers have become more and more frequent, so what they are
