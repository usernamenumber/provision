1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,576
It begins with a large tortilla.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,596
Cut a strip from the middle where it's widest and free this long rectangle

3
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:10,392
from the useless wedges that surround it.

4
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,631
This is how we start our journey to us creating the perfect food.

5
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:17,220
The hardest part is folding an angle of equal thirds,

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,596
but if you folded a piece of paper into thirds for a letter or pamphlet,

7
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:22,389
you know the principle.

8
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,892
Approximate, and then adjust, until you reach a quality.

9
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:28,731
In the case of the tortilla, to get an equilateral triangle you fold an angle,

10
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:30,480
rather than an edge.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,155
Be sure your folds meet at a point, one corner of a triangle.

12
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:39,115
Unlike paper, the soft and delicious tortilla is forgiving,

13
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:43,863
Adjusting easily, rather than creasing and crumbling.

14
00:00:43,863 --> 00:00:45,447
Continue folding one triangle on top of another.

15
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:47,578
Pinch each fold to give it a crease.

16
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:49,747
Ten triangles are necessary.

17
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:51,915
Remove the extra.

18
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:54,519
Arrange the strip of triangles into a hexagon.

19
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:58,460
Note that the folds naturally want to go the same way you creased them.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,881
This will help you to arrange the overlap so that it is symmetric,

21
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:07,138
woven together the same way you would fold the flaps on top of a box, to support each other.

22
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,971
In paper, I might use 9 triangles, and then a piece of tape.

23
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:15,187
For a tortilla, use ten and attach the first to the last.

24
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:19,816
Score the tortilla lightly with a knife to ruff it up and then use your fingers to wet it with water.

25
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:22,404
The water combines with the flour and the tortilla.

26
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,572
And by pressing the triangles firmly to one another,

27
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,908
they are effectively glued together.

28
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,328
Thus, a tortilla hexaflexagon is created.

29
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:37,937
It can be flexed by pinching two triangles together and pushing in the opposite side to get a flat 3 armed shape, then opening up the inside.

30
00:01:37,937 --> 00:01:42,301
However, it is imperfect, for it is not yet delicious.

31
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:47,387
Luckily, there are several sophisticated tools with which to relegate this problem,

32
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,105
the first of which is guacamole.

33
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:55,685
I start with the easiest spreadable ingredients which can be folded flat into the hexaflexagon.

34
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:59,145
Flex it by lifting the three parts with the flapy foldy creases,

35
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:11,406
and fold them to the inside. Then the bottom can be opened up, and the flexagon is once again ready to be piled with delicious ingredients, the precious guacamole being stood safely within the folds.

36
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:15,937
After adding beans and cheese, your hexaflexamexagon is ready for consumption.

37
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:22,881
To eat, flex only halfway and to bite the delicious exposed, triangular pockets of flex mex perfection.

38
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:27,437
As you can see, the ingredients tend to leak slightly out of the folds of the flexagon.

39
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:33,223
This is expected, and unavoidable, as the nature of the burrito is to be a delicious leaking mess

40
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:37,597
regardless of whether it is cylindercle or hexaflexaginal.

41
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:43,175
As your next flex mex project, consider the humble crane, guarding her flavorful nest.
