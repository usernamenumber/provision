1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,150
Let's do a couple more examples

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,310
graphing rational functions.

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:11,530
So let's say I have y is equal
to 2x over x plus 1.

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,600
So the first thing we might
want to do is identify our

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,180
horizontal asymptotes,
if there are any.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,440
And I said before, all you
have to do is look at the

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,510
highest degree term in the
numerator and the denominator.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,210
The highest degree term here,
there's only one term.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,140
It is 2x.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,450
And the highest degree
term here is x.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,780
They're both first-degree
terms.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,630
So you can say that as x
approaches infinity, y is

14
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,150
going to be-- as x gets
super-large values, these two

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,300
terms are going to dominate.

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,280
This isn't going to
matter so much.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,710
So then our expression, then y
is going to be approximately

18
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,570
equal to 2x over x, which
is just equal to 2.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,140
That actually would
also be true as x

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,990
approaches negative infinity.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,440
So as x gets really large or
super-negative, this is going

22
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,340
to approach 2.

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,210
This term won't matter much.

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,330
So let's graph that horizontal
asymptote.

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,980
So it's y is equal to 2.

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,810
Let's graph it.

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,800
So this is our horizontal
asymptote right there.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,000
   

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,340
y is equal to 2, that right
there-- let me write it down--

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,340
horizontal asymptote.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,820
That is what our graph
approaches but never quite

32
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,950
touches as we get to more and
more positive values of x or

33
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,890
more and more negative
values of x.

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,800
Now, do we have any vertical
asymptotes here?

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,700
Well, sure.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,410
We have when x is equal to
negative 1, this equation or

37
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,630
this function is undefined.

38
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:07,030
So we say y undefined when
x is equal to negative 1.

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,800
That's definitely true because
when x is equal to negative 1,

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,130
the denominator becomes zero.

41
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,830
We don't know what 1/0 is.

42
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,200
It's not defined.

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,670
And this is a vertical asymptote
because the x

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,160
doesn't cancel out.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,490
The x plus 1-- sorry--
doesn't cancel out

46
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,610
with something else.

47
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,050
Let me give you a quick
example right here.

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,170
Let's say I have the equation
y is equal to x plus

49
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,070
1 over x plus 1.

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,430
In this circumstance, you might
say, hey, when x is

51
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,730
equal to negative 1, my
graph is undefined.

52
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,470
And you would be right because
if you put a negative 1 here,

53
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,770
you get a 0 down here.

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,420
In fact, you'll also
get a 0 on top.

55
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,330
You'll get a 0 over a 0.

56
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,370
It's undefined.

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,040
But as you can see, if you
assume that x does not equal

58
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,630
negative 1, if you assume that
this term and that term are

59
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,310
not equal to zero, you can
divide the numerator and the

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,340
denominator by x plus 1, or you
could say, well, that over

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,710
that, if it was anything
else over itself, it

62
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,950
would be equal to 1.

63
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:14,740
You would say this would be
equal to 1 when x does not

64
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,340
equal negative 1 or when these
terms don't equal zero.

65
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,810
It equals 0/0, which we don't
know what that is, when x is

66
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,090
equal to negative 1.

67
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,570
So in this situation,
you would not

68
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,140
have a vertical asymptote.

69
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:36,610
So this graph right here,
no vertical asymptote.

70
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,350
And actually, you're probably
curious, what does

71
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,850
this graph look like?

72
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,470
I'll take a little aside here
to draw it for you.

73
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,170
This graph right here, if I had
to graph this right there,

74
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,810
what this would be is this would
be y is equal to 1 for

75
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,250
all the values except for x
is equal to negative 1.

76
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,760
So in this situation the graph,
it would be y is equal

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:04,090
to 1 everywhere, except for
y is equal to negative 1.

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,355
And y is equal to negative
1, it's undefined.

79
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,710
So we actually have
a hole there.

80
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,070
We actually draw a little circle
around there, a little

81
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,760
hollowed-out circle, so that we
don't know what y is when x

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,990
is equal to negative 1.

83
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,360
So this looks like
that right there.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,940
It looks like that
horizontal line.

85
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,580
No vertical asymptote.

86
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,270
And that's because this term and
that term cancel out when

87
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,370
they're not equal to zero,
when x is not equal to

88
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,310
negative 1.

89
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,640
So when your identifying
vertical asymptotes-- let me

90
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,160
clear this out a little bit.

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
when you're identifying vertical
asymptotes, you want

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
to be sure that this expression
right here isn't

93
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,080
canceling out with something
in the numerator.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,410
And in this case, it's not.

95
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,160
In this case, it did,
so you don't

96
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,400
have a vertical asymptote.

97
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,410
In this case, you aren't
canceling out, so this will

98
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,560
define a vertical asymptote.

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,610
x is equal to negative 1 is a
vertical asymptote for this

100
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,690
graph right here.

101
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,720
So x is equal to negative 1--
let me draw the vertical

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,510
asymptote-- will
look like that.

103
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,250
   

104
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,080
And then to figure out what the
graph is doing, we could

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,630
try out a couple of values.

106
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,270
So what happens when
x is equal to 0?

107
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,080
So when x is equal to 0 we have
2 times 0, which is 0

108
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800
over 0 plus 1.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,700
So it's 0/1, which is 0.

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,970
So the point 0, 0
is on our curve.

111
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,990
What happens when
x is equal to 1?

112
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,860
We have 2 times 1, which
is 2 over 1 plus 1.

113
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,040
So it's 2/2.

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,310
So it's 1, 1 is also
on our curve.

115
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,380
So that's on our curve
right there.

116
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,630
So we could keep plotting
points, but the curve is going

117
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,730
to look something like this.

118
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,020
It looks like it's going
approach negative infinity as

119
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,600
it approaches the vertical
asymptote from the right.

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,500
So as you go this way it, goes
to negative infinity.

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,010
And then it'll approach our
horizontal asymptote from the

122
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,665
negative direction.

123
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,100
So it's going to look
something like that.

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,850
And then, let's see, what
happens when x is equal to--

125
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,765
let me do this in
a darker color.

126
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,520
I'll do it in this red color.

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,540
What happens when x is
equal to negative 2?

128
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,420
We have negative 2 times
2 is negative 4.

129
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,420
And then we have negative-- so
it's going to be negative 4

130
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,950
over negative 2 plus 1,
which is negative 1,

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,760
which is just 4.

132
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,460
So it's just equal
to negative 2, 4.

133
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,940
So negative 2-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

134
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,460
Negative 2, 4 is on our line.

135
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,560
And what about-- well, let's
just do one more point.

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,040
What about negative 3?

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,536
So the point negative 3-- on the
numerator, we're going to

138
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,010
get 2 times negative 3 is
negative 6 over negative 3

139
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,570
plus 1, which is negative 2.

140
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,290
Negative 6 over negative
2 is positive 3.

141
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,150
So negative 3, 3.

142
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,890
1, 2, 3.

143
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,090
1, 2, 3.

144
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,660
So that's also there.

145
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,393
So the graph is going to look
something like that.

146
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:14,390
   

147
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,570
So as we approach negative
infinity, we're going to

148
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,170
approach our horizontal
asymptote from above.

149
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,115
As we approach negative 1, x is
equal to negative 1, we're

150
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,270
going to pop up to positive
infinity.

151
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,340
So let's verify that once again
this is indeed the graph

152
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,180
of our equation.

153
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,780
Let's get our graphing
calculator out.

154
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:46,660
We're going to define y as 2x
divided by x plus 1 is equal

155
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,530
to-- delete all of that out--
and then we want to graph it.

156
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,650
And there we go.

157
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,520
It looks just like
what we drew.

158
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,680
And that vertical asymptote, it
connected the dots, but we

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,240
know that it's not
defined there.

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,450
It just tried to connect
the super-positive

161
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,490
value all the way down.

162
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,660
Because it's just trying out--
all the graphing calculator's

163
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,740
doing is actually just making
a very detailed table of

164
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,460
values and then just connecting
all the dots.

165
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,740
So it doesn't know that this
is an asymptote, so it

166
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,340
actually tried to connect
the dots.

167
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,350
But there should be no
connection right there.

168
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,190
Hopefully, you found this
example useful.
