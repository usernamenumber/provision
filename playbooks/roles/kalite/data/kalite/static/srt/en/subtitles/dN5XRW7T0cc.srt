1
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:14,636
We've walked into the cathedral under the part of the church that remains from 1140 - 1145

2
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:19,433
into the post-fire church, begun in 1194.

3
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:24,369
And you get that sense that the priority for the architect was the stained glass.

4
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:29,403
Even though it's a brilliantly lit day outside, we walk in and we're in this dark space,

5
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:35,836
and it almost seems as if these windows are not so much attached to walls, or they're not so much openings in walls,

6
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,833
the walls themselves disappear and they're almost like floating planes of light.

7
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:46,168
When the sun is coming in from the right direction, the walls are speckled with coloured light in a way that

8
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:51,613
almost makes the walls and the piers turn into spirit instead of matter.

9
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:56,672
This use of light is a symbol for divinity.

10
00:00:56,672 --> 00:01:02,209
And the colours of the glass, the deepest blues, the richest reds, and purples...

11
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:06,839
They're vivid in a way that I think the medieval would have rarely seen.

12
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:13,001
What the architect of Chartres did, was to eliminate what had been a four part elevation,

13
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:20,236
consisting of the nave arcade, a gallery, a triforium, and windows, with a clear story.

14
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:24,269
Here the architect eliminated the galleries, now we've just got a three part elevation.

15
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:28,468
What that allowed for was an enlargement of the panes of glass.

16
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:37,204
We also notice other Gothic elements, like the pointed arches as opposed to the round arches of the Romanesque

17
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:44,415
the ribbed vaults that allowed the Gothic architect to raise the height of the church.

18
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:50,915
And also to emphasise the linear, the movement of the eye upward, and unlike a rounded Roman arch,

19
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:55,235
which brings your eye back down, the Gothic brings you up, and then leaves you up.

20
00:01:55,235 --> 00:02:00,602
Now let's walk into the church, not down the nave, but through the side isle, as a pilgrim might.

21
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:05,752
The piers, they alternate between squares and circles, and they have outer bundled columns,

22
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:11,109
which alternate again, so there is this subtle and complex alternating play,

23
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:15,135
the sense of rhythm meant to invoke the immaterial heavenly realm.

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:21,608
Now passing the transepts and moving back towards the choir, in the typical Romanesque church,

25
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:26,336
many of the treasures of the cathedral would be kept in the radiating chapels.

26
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:33,103
And the idea of a radiating chapel is that it's a series of separated spaces around the apse.

27
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:42,465
And one of the things that happens in a Gothic church is the integration of these spaces.

28
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:44,001
In fact that's one of the ways that art historians think about the difference between the Gothic and the Romanesque,

29
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:52,741
is that with the Gothic there's a unified space, and with the Romanesque parts still retain their separateness.

30
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:58,936
Something important happens with the unity of the choir in a Gothic cathedral,

31
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:03,640
which is that the light from one chapel radiates into each of the others, and they're seen as a whole.

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,380
None of these elements are meant to be seen individually, that is the proportions of the entire church,

33
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,474
the relationships between the windows and the architecture, the entire ensemble is meant to evoke and inspire.
