00:00:00,193 --> 00:00:02,478
What we are going to think about in this video

2
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:04,813
is elasticity of demand.

3
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:11,177
elasti-ci-ty -- elasticity of demand.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,874
And what this is, is a measure of

5
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:17,573
how does the quantity demanded change, given a change in price,

6
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:21,171
or how does a change in price impact the quantity demanded.

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:26,224
So change in price -- change -- change in price

8
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:30,573
change in price

9
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:34,862
impact quantity (want to be careful here)

10
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:36,035
quantity demanded.

11
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:37,121
When you talk about demand,

12
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,462
you are talking about the whole curve.

13
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:40,512
Quantity demanded is a specific quantity.

14
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:44,912
Quantity demanded.

15
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:47,329
And the way that we as economists --

16
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,640
I'm not really an economist

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,375
but since we are doing economics,

18
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,755
we can pretend to be economists --

19
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:54,789
The way economists measure this is

20
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,779
they measure it as a % change in,

21
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:10,050
% change in Quantity over the % change in Price.

22
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,512
And the reason that they do this, as opposed to just say,

23
00:01:12,512 --> 00:01:15,013
change in quantity over change in price, is

24
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:17,782
because if you did change in quantity over change in price,

25
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:19,116
you would have a number

26
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:20,785
that is specific to the units you were using.

27
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:22,349
So it would depend on whether you were doing quantity

28
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,397
in terms of per hour, per week, or per year.

29
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:26,961
And so you would have different numbers

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,460
based on time frame, or the units you might use.

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,578
But when you use a percentage,

32
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:35,196
when you use a percentage, it is a unitless number.

33
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,492
Because the % you're taking a change in some quantity

34
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:40,161
divided by that quantity,

35
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:43,396
so the units themselves actually cancel out.

36
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,301
And the reason why it is called elasticity --

37
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,205
this might make some sense to you --

38
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:50,161
or the reason why I like to think it's called elasticity

39
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:52,154
is I like to imagine something that's elastic,

40
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,200
like an elastic band or a rubber band.

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,977
And in a rubber band, if you pull it,

42
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,556
depending if something,

43
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:06,352
So let's say this one is inelastic.

44
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:09,512
So if you pull, you're not going to be able to pull it much.

45
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:10,653
It is going to be fairly stiff.

46
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:12,220
It's not going to stretch a lot.

47
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,478
While if something is inelastic,

48
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:18,692
or for given amount of force,

49
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,401
you are not able to pull it much.

50
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:21,480
And if something is elastic,

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,255
maybe for the same amount of force,

52
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:27,279
you're going to be able to pull it a lot.

53
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,050
So this right over here is elastic,

54
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,205
and so the analogy maybe might make a little sense

55
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,169
relative to applied price and demand.

56
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:38,460
Something is elastic... so let me write this down

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,295
Elastic, elastic. So let me write "very elastic."

58
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,993
Very elastic if a given change in price,

59
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:51,660
given price change, you have --

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,458
and especially, we'll talk about % in a little bit --

61
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,809
but the given change in price,

62
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,986
you have a large change in demand.

63
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,367
So large percentage change.

64
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:01,183
Let me speak in terms of percentage.

65
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:06,725
Given a % change in P,

66
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:13,089
you end up having a large % change in Q.

67
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:14,191
That would be very elastic.

68
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:16,837
So you could imagine the P is like the force,

69
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:20,671
and the Q, the quantity demanded is

70
00:03:20,671 --> 00:03:25,370
how far the thing can get stretched apart.

71
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,913
And that's why we would call this very elastic,

72
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,364
just like a very elastic rubber band.

73
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:33,524
And if something is very inelastic, very in-e-lastic,

74
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:39,642
if given a % change in P,

75
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:45,789
you have a small, small, % change in Q.

76
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,705
So, if -- Just like a rubber band --

77
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,144
for given amount of force

78
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:52,009
if you are not able to pull it very much at all,

79
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,494
then it is inelastic.

80
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,498
If you are able to pull it a lot, it is elastic.

81
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:58,158
Same thing with price and quantity.

82
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,435
If you, for given change in price -- if a change,

83
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,881
if the quantity demanded, if the % quantity demanded

84
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,865
changes a lot, very elastic.

85
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:09,231
If it doesn't change a lot, very inelastic.

86
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,156
Now with that out of the way,

87
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:15,090
let's actually calculate the elasticity for multiple points

88
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,241
along this demand curve right over here.

89
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,614
And I think that will give us a better grounding.

90
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:23,281
Especially because there are a little, slightly -- um,

91
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,365
I would call them -- unusual ways of calculating

92
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:29,161
the % change in quantity and the % change of price.

93
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,605
Just so we get the same number

94
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,864
when we have a positive change in price,

95
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:35,090
and the same as we get the negative change in price,

96
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,541
or a negative or a positive,

97
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,744
or a drop in price and an increase in price.

98
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,097
So let me give myself some real estate over here,

99
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:44,748
because I want to do some actual mathematics.

100
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:47,132
And actually, all of this we will be reviewing

101
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,416
in what I'm about to do and

102
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,598
it'll give me some real estate to work with.

103
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,581
So let me clear off all of that,

104
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:55,298
and let me clear that right over here.

105
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,117
And what I'm going to do is

106
00:04:56,117 --> 00:04:59,319
I'm going to calculate the elasticity of demand

107
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,264
at several points along this demand curve right over here.

108
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:05,481
And so the first one I will do at point A to point B,

109
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:09,330
so let me make another column right over here.

110
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,177
Elasticity of demand, and

111
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,536
actually we are going to have one column that is

112
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:16,286
elasticity of demand, so big E with a little subscript d,

113
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,280
and the other one, I'll just take its absolute value.

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,832
Because depending on --

115
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:22,604
sometimes people just like to think of the number

116
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,787
which will tend to be a negative number, and

117
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:27,455
sometimes people will like to look at the absolute value of it.

118
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,839
So we will look at both and see what it actually means.

119
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,939
So let's say our price drops from point A to point B.

120
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,571
So from point A to point B,

121
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,856
we have a $1, a -$1 change in price.

122
00:05:41,856 --> 00:05:45,807
And we have a positive, so this is a -$1 change in price,

123
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:48,922
and we have a positive $2 -- haha, sorry --

124
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:54,655
a positive 2 burger per hour change in quantity demanded.

125
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,471
So what is the elasticity of demand there?

126
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,918
Let's write it over here; I'll do it in A's color.

127
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,219
So the elasticity of demand, remember

128
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:07,023
it is the % change in quantity, so --

129
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,324
% change in quantity -- let me write it --

130
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:20,409
% change in quantity over % change in price.

131
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,124
And so we have -- what is our % change in quantity?

132
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,678
So it is going to be the change in quantity

133
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,518
over some base quantity.

134
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,684
So our change in quantity is 2,

135
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:34,273
so it's going to be equal to 2 over --

136
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,353
now in traditional terms,

137
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,647
this is what I want to kind of clarify,

138
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,024
is a little bit unusual in how we do it,

139
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,166
but we do it so we get the same elasticity of demand

140
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,210
whether we go from A to B or B to A,

141
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,291
or essentially we get the same elasticity of demand

142
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,973
along this whole part of the curve.

143
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:52,294
Instead of just dividing the change in quantity

144
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:55,480
divided by our starting point, what I want to do is

145
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,552
I'm going to divide the change in quantity divided by

146
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,627
the average of our starting and our ending points.

147
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,609
So that is going to be 2 over

148
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,398
-- and I'll actually do the math explicitly --

149
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,373
actually, no, let's just think about it.

150
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:08,587
What's the average between 2 and 4?

151
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,937
Well, the average is just going to be 3.

152
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:13,037
That's the average of 2 and 4.

153
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,515
I could write -- let me write it down

154
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:16,169
just so it's clear.

155
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,802
This right over here -- that right over here -- is

156
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:23,153
2 + 4 over 2. That's how you get 3.

157
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:25,460
That's how you would calculate the average.

158
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,410
Alright, so that is our proportionate change,

159
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,660
and then you want to multiply by 100 -- times 100 --

160
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,861
to actually get a percentage.

161
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:38,009
And then what is our change in price?

162
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,644
Well, we are going to do the same thing:

163
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:42,244
the percent change in price.

164
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:46,620
Our change in price is -1. It is -1, over --

165
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,267
and once again, we don't just do -1 divided by 9 --

166
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,606
We do it over the average of 8 and 9,

167
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,955
and the average of 8 and 9 is 8.5,

168
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:00,721
and then multiply by 100 to get your percentage.

169
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:05,071
Now these hundreds obviously cancel out

170
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,090
and so we are going to be left with --

171
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,022
when you divide by a fraction, it's the same thing

172
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,222
as multiplying by its inverse.

173
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:17,681
So we are going to get 2/3 times -8.5/1

174
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:23,348
or times -8.5 -- times -8.5.

175
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:25,905
Get out our calculator and it is --

176
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,518
so 2, well, I'll multiply 2,

177
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:35,263
times -8.5 and then divided by 3,

178
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:40,806
which gives us -5.6667, which is really -5 and 2/3.

179
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:42,444
So I'll just write it negative --

180
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:44,990
I'll round it as -5.67.

181
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,670
So this is approximately equal to -5.67.

182
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,707
So right over here, it is -5.67,

183
00:08:55,707 --> 00:09:00,587
and this absolute value is obviously just 5.67.

184
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:04,053
And I'll leave it to you to verify for yourself that

185
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:07,853
you'll get the same elasticity of demand using this technique

186
00:09:07,853 --> 00:09:11,002
when you use the average of base of your percentage,

187
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:14,518
going from 9 to 8 in price

188
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:16,630
as going from 8 to 9 in price,

189
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,147
which is different than if you used 9 as the base

190
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:21,300
or the 8 as the base.

191
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,035
So this right here is the elasticity of demand,

192
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,851
not just of point A -- you can kind of view it as

193
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,450
the average elasticity of demand over this little part of the curve,

194
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,201
(which is really a line in this example)

195
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,652
over this part of the arc.

196
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:36,982
So we will write that part right over here;

197
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:38,226
I'll write the absolute value.

198
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:41,746
The absolute value of our elasticity of demand is 5.67.

199
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,457
Now, let's do the other 2 sections right over here.

200
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:48,379
So let's think about what happens --

201
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,325
let's think about what happens when we go from C to D.

202
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,925
So our elasticity of demand there -- so from C to D,

203
00:09:56,925 --> 00:10:00,792
we have a change in quantity, once again, of +2,

204
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:04,441
and our change in price, once again, is -1.

205
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,655
But we will see that even though -- that

206
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:09,238
the change in quantity over -- the change in quantity and

207
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:11,037
the change in price is the same, we're going to have

208
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:14,205
a different elasticity of demand because we'll start --

209
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:15,769
we have different starting points.

210
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,740
Our starting points and our ending points for price are lower,

211
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,168
and our starting and ending points for quantity are higher.

212
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:23,770
So it will actually change the percentage.

213
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,571
So let's see what we get.

214
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,645
So our percent change in quantity --

215
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,489
we have a change in quantity of 2,

216
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:34,201
and then our average quantity is 9 + 11,

217
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:38,813
which is 20, divided by 2 is 10.

218
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:42,253
All of that over change -- percent change in price --

219
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,253
so we have -1,

220
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:47,969
-1 (let me scroll down a little bit)

221
00:10:47,969 --> 00:10:51,536
-1 divided by the change in...

222
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,120
-1 divided by the average price.

223
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,427
So -1 is the change in price and

224
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:58,135
we want to divide that by the average price.

225
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,872
Well, 5.50 plus 4.50 is 10 dollars

226
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:02,511
divided by 2 is 5.

227
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:05,120
So the average price is 5.

228
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,105
And we can multiply the numerator by 100

229
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,409
and the denominator by 100,

230
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:10,361
but that won't change anything,

231
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:13,236
because we can just divide both by 100.

232
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:16,620
And so this is equal to 2 over 10, times

233
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,787
-- dividing by a fraction is

234
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:20,152
the same as multiplying by its inverse --

235
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,636
times -5 over 1, and this is just,

236
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:25,243
because 2 over 10 is the same as 1/5,

237
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:29,604
1/5 * -5/1, it is -1.

238
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:32,164
So this right over here, so our elasticity of demand

239
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:35,298
right over here is -1, or its absolute value is 1.

240
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,640
So the absolute value of the elasticity of demand,

241
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,473
right over here, is equal to 1.

242
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:43,168
And let's just do one more section,

243
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,128
and then maybe the next video,

244
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:47,365
we can think a little bit about what it is telling us.

245
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,441
So let's think, do this last section over here,

246
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:50,945
just for some practice.

247
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:53,947
I encourage you to pause it and try it yourself. And so,

248
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,382
we are going to think about this section right over here.

249
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,998
So once again, our change in quantity is +2,

250
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:02,898
and our change in price is -1.

251
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,902
And our elasticity of demand:

252
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,772
change in quantity, 2,

253
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:10,010
over average quantity, which is 17.

254
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,674
Change in price is -1, over average price:

255
00:12:14,674 --> 00:12:17,240
1 + 2 divided by 2 is $1.50,

256
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,371
or a $1.50 is right between these two.

257
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,517
Divided by $1.50.

258
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,648
We don't have to multiply the numerator or the denominator by 100

259
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:25,857
because those just cancel out.

260
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:30,332
So we get 2 over 17 times negative --

261
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,303
well we can just write this as $-1.50 over 1.

262
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:38,743
And this is equal to getting our calculator back out.

263
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:42,282
So this is equal to -- I'll just write,

264
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:44,859
well, it's really just going to be -3 over 17, right?

265
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:48,499
2 * -1.50 is -3, over 17 is

266
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:55,253
-- -3 divided by 17 -- is equal to -.1,

267
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:59,968
I'll just say -.18. So here it is.

268
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:05,910
-0.18, and its absolute value is 0.18.

269
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,844
So the elasticity of demand over here is 0.18.

270
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,775
And I'll leave you there, and in the next video,

271
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,369
we'll think about these results a little bit.
