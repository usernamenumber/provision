1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:06,367
We're asked to simplify the cube root of twenty seven a squared times b to the fifth

2
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,040
times c to the third power.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,969
And the goal whenever you try to just simplify a cube,a cube root like this, is we wanna look

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,696
at the parts of this exepression

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:16,715
over here,

6
00:00:16,715 --> 00:00:20,123
that are perfect cubes that are something raised to the 3rd power

7
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:24,369
that we can take just the cube root of those, since you taking them out of the radical sign

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,782
and then leaving everything else that is not a perfect cube inside of it

9
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:29,302
so let's see what we can do

10
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:32,374
so first of all 27, you may or may not already recognise this

11
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:34,241
is a perfect cube,if you don't already recognise it, you can

12
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,300
actually do a prime factorisation and see it is a perfect cube

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,452
27 is 3 times 9 and

14
00:00:41,452 --> 00:00:44,442
9 is 3 times 3 so 27

15
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:48,634
prime factorisation is 3 times 3 times 3, so is the exact

16
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,785
same thing as 3 to the third power, so

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,125
let's rewrite this whole expression down here, let's try in terms of things

18
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,220
that are perfect cube and things that aren't, so 27 can be just rewritten

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,039
as 3 to the third power, then you have

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,902
a squared, clearly not a perfect cube, but if the third would have been

21
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,636
so we just gonna write this, let me write it over here

22
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:13,969
we can switch the order here, cause we just have a bunch of things being multiple by each other, so i'll write

23
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,436
the a squared over here,b to the fifth

24
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:21,100
b to the fifth is not a perfect cube by itself

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,533
it can be, it can be expressed as a product of a perfect cube

26
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,977
in another thing, b to the fifth is the exact same thing as the

27
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:31,175
b to the third power times b to the second power

28
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:35,290
if you wanna see that explicitly b to the fifth is b times b times

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,301
b times b times b

30
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:42,370
so this, the first three are clearly b to the third power

31
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,034
and then you have b to the second power after it, so we can rewrite

32
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:50,125
b to the fifth as a product of a perfect cube, so

33
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,790
i'll write b to the third (doing the same purple colour)

34
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,970
so we have b to the third power over here

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,705
and this b to the thirds times b squared, so i'll write the b squared

36
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:03,970
over here, we assume we gonna multiply all this stuff, and then finally

37
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,536
finally, we have(other than blue)

38
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:11,039
c to the third power, clearly this is a perfect cube

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
it is c cube,it is c to the third power, so i'll

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,198
put it over here, so this is c to the third power, and of cause we still have

41
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:22,036
that over arching radical sign, so we still

42
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:26,237
trying to take the cube root of all of this, and we know

43
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:29,039
from our exponent properties, or we could say from our radical properties

44
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,637
that this is the exact same thing, that taking the cube root of all of this

45
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:35,970
things is the same as taking the cube root of these individual factors

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,302
and then multiplying them, so this is the same thing as

47
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:43,036
the cube root, and I can separate them out individually or I could say that

48
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,436
cube root of 3 to the third, b to the third

49
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:49,569
c to the third,I'll have to use it both ways, so i'll start taking them

50
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,791
out separately, so this is the same thing as the cube root of

51
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:56,229
three to the third times the cube root ( I'll write

52
00:02:56,229 --> 00:03:00,637
them all it, while I write do it we'll colour code so we all don't get confused )

53
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:03,562
times the cube root of to b to the third times

54
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,638
the cube root times the

55
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:10,894
cube root of c to the third

56
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:13,629
c to the third, times the cube root

57
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:17,236
and i'll just group these two guys together just because we're not gonna be able to

58
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,861
simply them anymore, times the cube root, times the

59
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,862
cube root of a squared b squared

60
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:25,562
( I'll keep the colour consistent while we are trying to figure out what's what )

61
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,962
a squared, b squared, now I could have, could have said

62
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:32,444
that this is times the cube root of a squared times the cube root of b squared, but that won't

63
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:35,426
simplify anything, but that won't simplify anything so i'll just leave these like this, and so we

64
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:39,636
can look as these individually the cube root of 3 to the third or the cube root of

65
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,438
27, well that's clearly just gonna be ( i'm gonna do that in that

66
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:46,295
yellow colour ) this is clearly just gonna be 3

67
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,226
right, 3 to the third power is three to the third power

68
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:53,293
or it is equal to 27, this term right over here, the cube root

69
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:56,443
of b to the third, well that is just b, that's just b

70
00:03:56,443 --> 00:04:00,436
and the cube root of c to the third, the cube root of c to the third, well

71
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:04,028
that is clearly (won't do that in that ) that is

72
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:06,275
clearly just c

73
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,273
So our whole expression have simplified to

74
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:13,295
3 times b times c

75
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,962
times c, times the cube root

76
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:20,775
times the cube root, of a squared b squared

77
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,192
times the cube root of a squared

78
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:27,630
a squared, b squared, and we're done

79
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,226
i just wanna do just one other thing, just cause I did mentioned I would do it

80
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:34,963
we could simplify it this way, or we could recoignise, we could recoignise

81
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:38,295
that this expression right over here can be written as

82
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:41,237
3 b c

83
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:47,021
to the third power, but if I take 3 things to the third power and i'm multiplying it, that is the same thing as

84
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,962
multiplying them first and then raising to the third power, comes straight out

85
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:53,230
of our exponent properties, and so we can rewrite this as

86
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,774
cube root, the cube root of all of this times

87
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:01,460
the cube root, times the cube root of a squared

88
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,787
b squared, and so the cube root of all this of 3 b

89
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,960
c of the third power, well that's just gonna be 3

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,494
b c and then multiply it by the cube root of

91
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:14,229
a squared b squared, I didn't take the trouble to colour code it this time cause we already

92
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,629
figured out one way to solve it, but hopefully that also makes sense, we could have gone

93
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:23,669
that we could have done this either way, but the important thing is that we get the same answer.
