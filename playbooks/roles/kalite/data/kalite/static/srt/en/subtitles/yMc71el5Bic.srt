1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Good morning.

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,980
We are now on page 582.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,065
We're going to start
test number four.

4
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:10,150
So let's start with the first
problem, problem number one.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,520
When Miss Yun arrived at the
grocery store, there were five

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,280
packages of hot dog rolls
left on the shelf.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,860
One package contained 12 rolls,
and each of the other

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,600
packages contained 8 rolls.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,250
So there's five packages, one
contained 12 rolls, and then

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,010
the other four contained
8 rolls, right?

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,930
Because there was 5 total.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,950
If Miss Jung bought all five
packages, how many hot dog

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,900
rolls did she purchase
at the store?

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,060
So it's 12 rolls from that
one, plus 4 times 8.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,000
Well that's 32.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,630
So 2 plus 2 is 4, and then 44.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,120
So she bought 44 rolls,
and that's choice C.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,090
The hardest part there is
just the multiplication.

19
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,480
Number two, A, B, and
C are points on a

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,630
line in that order.

21
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,180
OK, let's draw that.

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,445
So there's my line.

23
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:24,770
OK, so A, B, and C are points
on a line: A, B, and C.

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:32,340
If A, B equals 30, and B,
C is 20 more than A,

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,815
B-- so B, C is what?

26
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:38,300
It's 20 more than this,
so it's 50, right--

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,460
what does A, C equal?

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,710
So what does this equal?

29
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,286
Well it's just 30 plus
50, it's 80.

30
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,780
And that is choice D.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,030
Next question.

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,950
And I will change colors.

33
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,580
Problem number three.

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,840
If x plus 3 is equal
to a, then what

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,890
does 2x plus 6 equal?

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,430
So the really fast way of doing
this is you just say

37
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,240
well, you know what?

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,760
2x plus 6, that's the
same thing as 2

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,090
times x plus 3, right?

40
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,460
And what's 2 times x plus 3?

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,170
Well x plus 3 is a, so this is
going to equal 2 times a.

42
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,745
And that's choice C.

43
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,630
And that's the fast
way to do it.

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,950
I mean, you could've done x is
equal to a minus 3, and then

45
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,180
substituted this in here, and
said 2 times a minus 3 plus 6.

46
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,710
You get 2a minus 6 plus 6, and
you would have gotten 2a.

47
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,180
This would have taken you
like 15 extra precious

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,140
seconds on the SAT.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,690
So if you saw this, immediately,
this would have

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,520
been a better way to do it.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,950
But this would have also
been a correct way.

52
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,870
The next question looks like--
well the next couple of

53
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,490
questions I'll have to do
some drawing for it.

54
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,080
OK, so they plot a bunch
of points out.

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,180
I'm trying to figure out how
I can draw the minimum.

56
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,510
I don't have to draw
the whole thing.

57
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,370
So that's the y-axis, x-axis.

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,640
Let's see, scores on tests.

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,122
I'm just going to draw the
points that look like-- so I

60
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,170
don't have to draw
the whole thing.

61
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,675
So you have points A, you
have point B here.

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,490
You have point C.

63
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,500
And then they have
point D here.

64
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,380
And then they have an E, which
it looks like it's the same

65
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,390
level as the B, point E.

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,600
And so we get where we are.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,110
So this line right here,
that's a 60.

68
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,100
And then they draw another
line right here.

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,320
And then this point
right here is 80.

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,580
That's 80, then this line down
here looks like roughly--

71
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,795
let's see, it's 40.

72
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:07,105
And where the C is, looks like
there's a line here.

73
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:11,881
Then the C is, there's a
60, then a line, and

74
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:15,010
there is a 80 there.

75
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,750
And in the book it says
the x-axis is the

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,000
score on test one.

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,370
And then the y-axis is test two,
the score on test two.

78
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,350
I know you can't read what I
wrote, but you can look at it

79
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:27,910
in your book.

80
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,910
Score on test two, so
these are the test

81
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,910
scores of five students.

82
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,140
So problem number four asks us,
for which student was the

83
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,360
change in scores, from test one
to test two, the greatest?

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,170
So which student either did
really bad on test one and

85
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,430
then improved to test two, or
did really good on test one,

86
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,220
and then kind of degraded?

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,780
Well let's see.

88
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,920
Let's get the chart.

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,305
So student B scored a 40
on test-- let's do

90
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,500
it actually in order.

91
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,180
So what was the change for A?

92
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,010
These aren't the choices, these
are just-- actually the

93
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,470
choices are the same
as the letters.

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,420
So A got a 40 on test
one, right?

95
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,140
Got a 40 on test one-- just
read it here-- and got

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,490
a 70 on test two.

97
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,210
So the change is 30.

98
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,895
B got a 40 on test one,
and a 60 on test two.

99
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:25,560
So the change is 20.

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,980
C got a 60 and a
70, that's 10.

101
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,180
D got an 80 and an 80, so
it's no difference.

102
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,680
And then E got an 80 and
a 60, or minus 20.

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,110
But the change is
still just 20.

104
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,490
We could write minus 20.

105
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,250
But the biggest change is
choice A: got a 40,

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,110
and then got a 70.

107
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,375
So really improved on
that second test.

108
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,940
And number five.

109
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,910
What was the average-- the
arithmetic mean-- of the

110
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,520
scores of the five students
on test two?

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,910
So the y-axis is test two.

112
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,070
So let's just write them out.

113
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,290
Student A got a 70.

114
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,380
Student B got a 60.

115
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,000
Student C got a 70.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,560
Student D got an 80.

117
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,042
Student E got a 60.

118
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:21,700
So 60, I don't know if
you can read that.

119
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,050
And then there are five
points, right?

120
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,050
So let's see, we could
just pretend

121
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,360
like this is a student.

122
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,020
That's a 60.

123
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,350
So let's see.

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,620
What's 7 plus 7?

125
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:44,730
Is 14, plus 6 is 20, plus
8 is 28, plus 6 is 34.

126
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,970
So it's 340 divided by 5.

127
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,960
And that equals what?

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
5 goes into 360, 68.

129
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,050
That's the average, or
the arithmetic mean.

130
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,600
And that's choice C.

131
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,850
Problem number six.

132
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,340
OK, they do a bunch of stuff.

133
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,590
I guess I should draw it too.

134
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,480
That's the line they drew.

135
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,310
And let's see, it's
going like that.

136
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,670
Let's see, so it goes
from minus 2 to 2.

137
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:35,475
So it's minus 2, minus 1, 0,
1, 2, and extra space.

138
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,240
So you're going to draw a bunch
of points, so I'll do it

139
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,290
in a different color.

140
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,790
So this is t.

141
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,095
And they have u,
v, w, all here.

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,190
And they put an x
here, then y, z.

143
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,370
So that's y and there's z.

144
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,850
They ask us, on the number line
above, t, u, v, w, x, y,

145
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,590
and z are coordinates of
the indicated points.

146
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,610
Which of the following is
closest to the absolute value

147
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,970
of u plus v?

148
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,550
So this is just an approximation
problem.

149
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,280
So you just have to kind of
look at this and guess

150
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,410
what u and v are.

151
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,330
So it looks like u is
about 3/4 the way

152
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,500
to negative 1, right?

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,789
So I'm just going to assume
that u is equal-- or

154
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,770
approximately equal, I can
do a squiggly equal-- u

155
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,120
approximately equals negative
3/4, right?

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,780
Because it's almost
at negative 1.

157
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,440
And then v looks halfway between
0 and negative 1, so

158
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,940
that looks about negative
1/2, right?

159
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,130
I don't know if that's
exact: negative 1/2.

160
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,990
So what's the absolute value
of minus 3/4 minus 1/2?

161
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,860
Well that's equal to
the absolute value.

162
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,750
You get a common denominator of
minus 3 minus 2/4, right?

163
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,260
That equals the absolute
value of minus 5/4.

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,200
The absolute value of minus
5/4 is equal to 5/4.

165
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,190
And if we look at the choices,
5/4, that's a little bit more

166
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:20,810
than 1, right?

167
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,090
That's equal to 1 and 1/4.

168
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,730
1 and 1/4?

169
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,670
This is 1, so a little
bit more than 1.

170
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,840
It looks like choice y
is our best answer.

171
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,900
So that is choice number D.

172
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,880
See you in the next video.
