1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,550
Let's say I've got a triangle.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:05,900
There is my triangle
right there.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,550
And I only know the lengths of
the sides of the triangle.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,490
This side has length a, this
side has length b, and

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,360
that side has length c.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,480
And I'm asked to find the
area of that triangle.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,870
So far all I'm equipped with is
the idea that the area, the

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,930
area of a triangle is equal
to 1/2 times the base of

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,380
the triangle times the
height of the triangle.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,570
So the way I've drawn this
triangle, the base of this

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,060
triangle, would be side c, but
the height we don't know.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,900
The height would be that h
right there and we don't

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,750
even know what that h is.

15
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,200
So this would be the h.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,360
So the question is how do
we figure out the area

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,660
of this triangle?

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,150
If you watched the last
video you know that you

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,440
use Heron's formula.

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,910
But the idea here is to try
to prove Heron's formula.

21
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,530
So let's just try to figure
out h from just using

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,970
the Pythagorean theorem.

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,190
And from there, once we know h,
we can apply this formula and

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,100
figure out the area
of this triangle.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,370
So we already
labeled this as h.

26
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,120
Let me define another
variable here.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,880
   

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,270
This is a trick you'll see
pretty often in geometry.

29
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,990
Let me define this is x, and if
this is x in magenta, then in

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,990
this bluish-purplish color,
that would be c minus x, right?

31
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,710
This whole length is c
-- the whole base is c.

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,560
So if this part is x, then
this part is c minus x.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,060
What I could do now, since
these are both right angles,

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,250
and I know that because this is
the height, I can set up two

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,600
Pythagorean theorem equations.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,890
First, I could do this left
hand side and I can write that

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,880
x squared plus h squared
is equal to a squared.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,690
That's what I get from
this left hand triangle.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,000
Then from this right hand
triangle, I get c minus x

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,030
squared plus h squared
is equal to b squared.

41
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,760
So I'm assuming I know a, b and
c, so I have two equations

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,950
with two unknowns.

43
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,290
The unknowns are x and h.

44
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,220
And remember, h is what
we're trying to figure out

45
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,270
because we already know c.

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,540
If we know h, we can
apply the area formula.

47
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,900
So how can we do that?

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,200
Well, let's substitute
for h to figure out x.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,360
When I say that I mean let's
solve for h squared here.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,890
If we solve for h squared
here we just subtract x

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,320
squared from both sides.

52
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,540
We can write that x squared --
sorry, we could write that

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,720
h squared is equal to a
squared minus x squared.

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,770
Then we could take this
information and substitute

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,640
it over here for h squared.

56
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,030
So this bottom equation
becomes c minus x

57
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,990
squared plus h squared.

58
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,610
h squared we know from this
left hand side equation.

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,620
h squared is going to be equal
to -- so plus, I'll do it in

60
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:19,160
that color -- a squared minus x
squared is equal to b squared.

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,650
I just substituted the
value of that in here, the

62
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,280
value of that in there.

63
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,860
Now let's expand this
expression out.

64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,750
c minus x squared, that
is c squared minus

65
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,320
2cx plus x squared.

66
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,200
Then we have the minus --
sorry, we have the plus a

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,280
squared minus x squared
equals b squared.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,660
   

69
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,060
We have an x squared and
a minus x squared there,

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,610
so those cancel out.

71
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,680
   

72
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,790
Let's add the 2cx to both
sides of this equation.

73
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,930
So now our equation
would become c squared

74
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,720
plus a squared.

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm adding 2cx to both sides.

76
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,440
So you add 2cx to this,
you get 0 is equal to

77
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,580
b squared plus 2cx.

78
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,370
All I did here is I canceled
out the x squared and then I

79
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,600
added 2cx to both sides
of this equation.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,130
My goal here is to solve for x.

81
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,580
Once I solve for x, then
I can solve for h and

82
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,350
apply that formula.

83
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,090
Now to solve for x, let's
subtract b squared

84
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,040
from both sides.

85
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,200
So we'll get c squared
plus a squared minus b

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,020
squared is equal to 2cx.

87
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,160
Then if we divide both sides by
2c, we get c squared plus a

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,600
squared minus b squared
over 2c is equal to x.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,880
We've just solved for x here.

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,290
Now, our goal is to solve
for the height, so that

91
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,930
we can apply 1/2 times
base times height.

92
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,120
So to do that, we go back to
this equation right here

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,040
and solve for our height.

94
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

95
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,290
We know that our height
squared is equal to a

96
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,520
squared minus x squared.

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,330
Instead of just writing x
squared let's substitute here.

98
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,430
So it's minus x squared -- x
is this thing right here.

99
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,880
So c squared plus a
squared minus b squared

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,670
over 2c, squared.

101
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,320
This is the same
thing as x squared.

102
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,090
We just solved for that.

103
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,950
So h is going to be equal to
the square root of all this

104
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,610
business in there -- I'll
switch the colors -- of a

105
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:00,070
squared minus c squared plus
a squared minus b squared

106
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,150
-- all of that squared.

107
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,800
Let me make it a little bit
neater than that because

108
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't want to--.

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,980
The square root -- make sure I
have enough space -- of a

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,130
squared minus all of this stuff
squared -- we have c squared

111
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,800
plus a squared minus b
squared, all of that over 2c.

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,670
That is the height
of our triangle.

113
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,310
The triangle that we
started off with up here.

114
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,360
Let me copy and paste that
just so that we can remember

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,070
what we're dealing with.

116
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,600
Copy it and then let me
paste it down here.

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,300
So I've pasted it down here.

118
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,210
So we know what the height
is -- it's this big

119
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,830
convoluted formula.

120
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,180
The height in terms of a, b
and c is this right here.

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,570
So if we wanted to figure out
the area -- the area of our

122
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,270
triangle -- let me
do it in pink.

123
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,772
The area of our triangle is
going to be 1/2 times our base

124
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:09,850
-- our base is this entire
length, c -- times c times our

125
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,260
height, which is this
expression right here.

126
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,680
Let me just copy and
paste this instead of--.

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,390
So let me copy and paste.

128
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,450
So times the height.

129
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,910
So this now is our
expression for the area.

130
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,810
Now you're immediately saying
gee, that doesn't look a lot

131
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,790
like Heron's formula,
and you're right.

132
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,360
It does not look a lot like
Heron's formula, but what I'm

133
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,820
going to show you in the next
video is that this essentially

134
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,230
is Heron's formula.

135
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,050
This is a harder to remember
version of Heron's formula.

136
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to apply a lot of
algebra to essentially simplify

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,260
this to Heron's formula.

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,430
But this will work.

139
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,520
If you could memorize this,
I think Heron's a lot

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,050
easier to memorize.

141
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,300
But if you can memorize this
and you just know a, b and

142
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,700
c, you apply this formula
right here and you will get

143
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,940
the area of a triangle.

144
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,290
Well, actually let's just apply
this just to show that this at

145
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,710
least gives the same
number as Heron's.

146
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,920
So in the last video we had a
triangle that had sides 9, 11

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,350
and 16, and its area using
Heron's was equal to 18

148
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,290
times the square root of 7.

149
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,780
Let's see what we get when we
applied this formula here.

150
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:36,260
So we get the area is equal
to 1/2 times 16 times the

151
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,300
square root of a squared.

152
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:49,330
That is 81 minus -- let's see,
c squared is 16, so that's 256.

153
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:58,020
256 plus a squared, that's
at 81 minus b squared,

154
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,250
so minus 121.

155
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,120
All of this stuff is squared.

156
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,530
All of that over 2 times c
-- all of that over 32.

157
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,150
So let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

158
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,770
81 minus 121, that is minus 40.

159
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,790
So this becomes 216 over 32.

160
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,470
So area is equal to
1/2 times 8 is 8.

161
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,530
Let me switch colors.

162
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:38,820
1/2 times 16 is 8 times the
square root of 81 minus 256.

163
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,370
81 minus 121, that's minus 40.

164
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,370
256 minus 40 is 216.

165
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,270
216 over 32 squared.

166
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,630
Now, this is a lot of
math to do so let me

167
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,870
get out a calculator.

168
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,140
I'm really just trying to show
you that these two numbers

169
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,440
should give us our same number.

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,290
So if we turn on
our calculator--.

171
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,440
First of all, let's just
figure out what 18

172
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,420
square root of 7 are.

173
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,590
18 times the square root
of 7 -- this is what

174
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,580
we got using Heron's.

175
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,100
We got 47.62.

176
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,160
Let's see if this is 47.62.

177
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:26,700
So we have 8 times the square
root of 81 minus 216 divided

178
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:35,140
by 32 squared, and then we
close our square roots.

179
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,990
And we get the
exact same number.

180
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,890
I was worried -- I actually
didn't do this calculation

181
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,580
ahead of time so I might have
made a careless mistake.

182
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,310
But there you go, you get
the exact same number.

183
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,170
So our formula just now gave
us the exact same value

184
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,350
as Heron's formula.

185
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,030
But what I'm going to do in the
next video is prove to you that

186
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,690
this can actually be reduced
algebraically to Heron's.

187
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,990
