99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There was the Vietnamese war, was waging

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I was against the Vietnamese war,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was 15 years old.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I decided to start the magazine to campaign against it. It's called Student

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and was came us sort of national magazine for young people.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The magazine didn't make much money, but got a big circulation about 100.000 young people wanted a magazine

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and one day a took a adverts in the magazine, Virgin Records 10 to 60% off any album or any label

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and listed the kinds of records we liked, things like Frank Zappa, rather than Robbie Williams

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so became very much the rock 'n' roll mail order company.
