1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:03,032
Let's generalize the mathematics that we've

2
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:04,603
been doing in the last few videos

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:06,638
to calculate the real return, and maybe we'll come up

4
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:10,213
with some interesting formulas or some simple approximations

5
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:13,375
So we've been doing is we've been, at least in the first video

6
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,993
we converted everything to today's dollars

7
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,722
so the actual dollar return in today's dollars

8
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:23,206
is the amount that we got, or the net dollar return

9
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:25,554
and the net dollar return is the amount

10
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:28,067
that we originally invested

11
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,745
compounded by the nominal interest rate and

12
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:32,576
here we're assuming we're writing as a decimal

13
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:34,156
so in the example we've been using

14
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:38,816
it was 10%, so this is going to be 0.10

15
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:41,500
or this whole value is going to be 1.10.

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,019
and so this is how much we're going to get

17
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,688
after a year has past. So in our example

18
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:52,389
this was $110, $100 compounded by 1.1

19
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:55,575
and then from that you want to subtract how much we invested

20
00:00:55,575 --> 00:01:00,951
in today's dollars. Well we originally invested P dollars a year ago

21
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:05,085
and in today's dollars, we just need to grow it by the rate of inflation

22
00:01:05,085 --> 00:01:06,647
and in the examples we've been doing,

23
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:11,274
we assume the rate of inflation is 2%, so that would be 0.02

24
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,639
So this, this expression right over here is

25
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:17,953
actually the dollar return in today's dollars

26
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,119
it's this value right here that we calculated in the first video

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,413
and to calculate the real return, we want the dollar

28
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:28,853
return in today's dollars divided by the investment in today's dollars

29
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:31,464
and once again, this is the investment in today's dollars

30
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:33,485
it's the amount we invested originally

31
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:39,154
grown by inflation.

32
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:43,889
And this right over here gives us the real return.

33
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:46,430
Now one thing we can do right off the bat to simplify this

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,625
is that we have everything in the numerator,

35
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,805
and everything in the denominator is divisible by P

36
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:53,812
So let's divide the numerator and the denominator by P

37
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:57,715
Simplify it a little bit, just like that

38
00:01:57,715 --> 00:02:00,412
and then we get, we get, in the numerator

39
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:06,873
we get 1 + N - 1 + i , I'll write it like that still

40
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:15,766
all of that over 1 + i , is = to R

41
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:19,133
and I'm giving some space here because one simplification I can do here

42
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,817
is, I can add 1 to both sides of this equation

43
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:24,944
so if I add a 1 on the right hand side

44
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,035
I have to add a 1 on the left hand side.

45
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:32,664
But a 1 is the same thing as a 1 + i over a 1+ i

46
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:36,797
this is completely identical, cause this is dividing the same

47
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:39,146
thing by itself, so this is going to be a 1

48
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:42,978
So we're adding a 1 on the left, we're adding a 1 on the right

49
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,834
and the reason why I did that is it comes up with an interesting

50
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,980
simplification, we have the same denominator here

51
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,561
if I add the numerators, 1 + i + 1 + N - 1 + i

52
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:56,258
So this and this are going to cancel out

53
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:59,842
and we're going to be left with, in the numerator

54
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:02,677
we're just left with a 1 + the nominal interest rate

55
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:08,523
in the denominator, we just have a 1 + the rate of inflation

56
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:12,562
is equal to 1 + the real interest rate

57
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:16,677
and then we can multiply both sides times the 1 + i

58
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:22,194
multiply both sides times the 1 + i

59
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,674
and we get an interesting result

60
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,914
and to some degree this is a common sense result

61
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,067
and I want to show you this is completely consistent

62
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,579
with everything so far, these guys cancel out

63
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:34,013
and that you get when you compound by the nominal interest rate

64
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,469
that's the same thing as growing the real growth

65
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,006
and then that compounded by the rate of inflation

66
00:03:41,006 --> 99:59:59,999
Which actually makes a ton of sense.
