1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,420
In the last video, we showed
that the Laplace transform of

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:15,150
f prime of t is equal to s times
the Laplace transform of

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,160
our function f minus f of 0.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Now, what we're going to do
here is actually use this

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,430
property that we
showed is true.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,630
And use it to fill in some more
of the entries in our

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,080
Laplace transform table, that
you'll probably have to

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,455
memorize, sooner or later,
if you use Laplace

10
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,240
transforms a lot.

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:44,620
But we already learned that the
Laplace transform of sine

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,520
of a t is equal-- and we did
a very hairy integration by

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,765
parts problems to show that
that is equal to a over s

14
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:58,840
squared plus a squared.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,500
So let's use these two things we
know to figure out what the

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,470
Laplace transform of
cosine of a t is.

17
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,642
So the Laplace transform
of cosine of a

18
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,140
t is equal to what?

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,960
Well, if we assume that the
Laplace transform of cosine of

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,060
a t is the derivative of some
function, what is it the

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,170
derivative of?

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,670
Right?

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,180
Let me do it on the side.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,950
If f prime of t is equal to
cosine of a t, what is a

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,200
potential f of t?

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,670
   

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,020
Well, it's the antiderivative.

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,240
And we can just forget about the
constant, because we just

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,880
have to know nf of t for
which this is true.

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,720
So what's the antiderivative
cosine of it?

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,660
It's 1/a sine of a t.

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,220
Right?

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:09,630
So if this is f prime of t, then
that is equal to s times

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:20,620
the Laplace transform of its
antiderivative, or 1/a sine of

35
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,830
a t minus the antiderivative
evaluated at 0.

36
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,140
Minus 1/a sine of-- well,
a times 0 is 0.

37
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,310
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,725
So this whole term goes away.

39
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,540
   

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,510
This is a constant, right?

41
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,060
This 1/a.

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,385
And we showed that the Laplace

43
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:41,300
transform is a linear operator.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,320
So we can take it out.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,490
So this is equal to s/a times
the Laplace transform

46
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,290
of sine of a t.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,975
And that is equal to
s/a times a over f

48
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:59,910
squared plus a squared.

49
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,280
And the a's cancel out.

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,520
And that was much simpler than
the integration by parts we

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,050
had to do to figure this out.

52
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,500
So then we get that the Laplace
transform of cosine of

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,180
a t is equal to s over s
squared plus a squared.

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,630
And in three minutes, we filled
in another table in our

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,570
Laplace transform table.

56
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,190
And now we have the two most
important trig functions.

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,260
Let's keep going.

58
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,710
We haven't really done much
with polynomials.

59
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,960
We know a couple of things.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,180
   

61
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,060
We did this already.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,500
We know that the Laplace
transform of

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,420
1 is equal to 1/s.

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,600
So let's see if we could use
this and the fact that the

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,750
Laplace transform of f prime
is equal to s times the

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:04,680
Laplace transform of
f minus f of 0.

67
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,470
Or another way.

68
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,550
Let's rearrange this.

69
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,860
If we know f, how can we
figure out some Laplace

70
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,240
transforms in terms of
f prime and f of 0?

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,460
So let's just rearrange
this equation.

72
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,779
So we get the Laplace transform
of f prime.

73
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,050
I could write of t, but
that gets monotonous.

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:26,850
Plus f of 0 is equal to
s times the Laplace

75
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,230
transform of f.

76
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,820
Divide both sides by s.

77
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,800
Let me put the Laplace transform
of-- and I'm also

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,660
going to the sides.

79
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,020
So I guess the Laplace
transform-- my

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,270
l's are getting funky.

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,310
The Laplace transform of
f is equal to 1/s.

82
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,690
I'm just dividing both sides
by s, so 1/s times this.

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:59,270
Times the Laplace transform of
my derivative plus my function

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,830
evaluated at 0.

85
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,310
And let's see if we can use this
and this to figure out

86
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,180
some more useful Laplace
transforms.

87
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:17,106
Well what is the Laplace
transform of f of

88
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:18,370
t is equal to t?

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,390
   

90
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,330
Well, just use this property.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,980
This is going to be equal
to 1/s times the Laplace

92
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,250
transform of the derivative.

93
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,660
Well, what's the derivative
of t?

94
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,270
The derivative of t is 1.

95
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,840
So it's the Laplace transform
of 1 minus f of 0.

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,540
When t equals 0,
this becomes 0.

97
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,450
Minus 0.

98
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,600
So the Laplace transform of t
is equal to 1/s times the

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Laplace transform of 1.

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,840
Well that's just 1/s.

101
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,530
So it's 1 over s squared
minus 0.

102
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,350
Interesting.

103
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,530
The Laplace transform of 1 is
1/s, Laplace transform of t is

104
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,840
1/s squared.

105
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,260
Let's figure out what the
Laplace transform

106
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,200
of t squared is.

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,340
And I'll do this one in green.

108
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,830
And maybe we'll see
a pattern emerge.

109
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,440
The Laplace transform
of t squared.

110
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:25,140
Well, it equals 1/s times the
Laplace transform of it's

111
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,820
derivative.

112
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,340
So what's it's derivative?

113
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:36,550
Times the Laplace transform of
2t plus this evaluated at 0.

114
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,350
Well, that's just 0.

115
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,660
So this is equal to-- well
we can just take

116
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,550
this constant out.

117
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:50,440
This is equal to 2/s times the
Laplace transform of t.

118
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,380
Well, what does that equal?

119
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,300
We just solved it.

120
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,800
1/s squared.

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,950
So it's 2/s times 1/s squared.

122
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,340
So it's equal to 2/s
to the third.

123
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,790
   

124
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,040
Fascinating.

125
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,860
   

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,940
Well, let me just
do t the third.

127
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,300
And I think then you'll
see the pattern.

128
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,000
The pattern will emerge.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The Laplace transform.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,120
And this is actually
kind of fun.

131
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,340
I recommend you do it.

132
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,430
It's somehow satisfying.

133
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,190
It's much more satisfying than
integration by parts.

134
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,090
So the Laplace transform of t to
the third is 1/s times the

135
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,560
Laplace transform of it's

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,450
derivative, which is 3t squared.

137
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,900
Which is-- take the constant
out because

138
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,830
it's a linear operator.

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:48,270
3/s times the Laplace transform
of t squared.

140
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,200
So it equals what?

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,680
What's the Laplace transform
of t squared?

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,380
It's 2/s to the third.

143
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,470
So this equals 3 times 2 over
what? s to the fourth.

144
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,510
And you can put a t/n here and
use an inductive argument to

145
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,060
figure out a general formula.

146
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,130
And that general formula
is-- I think you

147
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,490
see the pattern here.

148
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,750
Whatever my exponent is, the
Laplace transform has an s in

149
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,420
the denominator with one
larger exponent.

150
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,280
And then the numerator is the
factorial of my exponent.

151
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,760
So in general, and this is one
more entry in our Laplace

152
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,380
transform table.

153
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:35,059
The Laplace transform of t to
the nth power is equal to n

154
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:42,674
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

155
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:47,450
   

156
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,360
That's a parenthesis.

157
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,520
I guess I didn't have to write
those parenthesis.

158
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,800
That just confuses it.

159
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,270
But anyway, when you see this in
a Laplace transform table,

160
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,250
it seems intimidating.

161
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,150
Oh boy, I have n's and I have n
factorials and all of that.

162
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,440
But it's just saying with this
pattern we showed, t to the

163
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,300
third increase it by 1, so
s the fourth, put another

164
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,640
denominator and take three
factorial on the numerator,

165
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,200
which is 6, right?

166
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
And that's all it is.

167
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,130
So using the derivative property
of Laplace transform,

168
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:22,240
we figured out the Laplace
transform of cosine of a t and

169
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,610
the Laplace transform of really
any polynomial, right?

170
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,410
Because it's a linear
operator.

171
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,960
So now we know t to the
nth power, t to

172
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,860
the whatever power.

173
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,690
And we can multiply
it by a constant.

174
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,170
So we know the basic
trig functions.

175
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,610
We know the exponential
function.

176
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,740
And we know how to take the
Laplace transform of

177
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,680
polynomials.

178
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,930
See you in the next video.

179
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,000
