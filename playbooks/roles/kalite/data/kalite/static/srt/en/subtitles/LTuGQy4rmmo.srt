1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010
   

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,950
In the last video we learned--
or at least I showed you, I

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,580
don't know if you've learned it
yet, but we'll learn it in

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:05,890
this video.

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,010
But we learned that the force
on a moving charge from a

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,020
magnetic field, and it's a
vector quantity, is equal to

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,320
the charge-- on the moving
charge-- times the cross

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,260
product of the velocity of the
charge and the magnetic field.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,720
And we use this to show you that
the units of a magnetic

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
field-- this is not a beta, it's
a B-- but the units of a

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,300
magnetic field are the tesla--
which is abbreviated with a

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,380
capital T-- and that
is equal to newton

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,000
seconds per coulomb meters.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
So let's see if we can apply
that to an actual problem.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,525
So let's say that I have a
magnetic field, and let's say

16
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:55,630
it's popping out
of the screen.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,440
I'm making this up on the
fly, so I hope the

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
numbers turn out.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,860
It's inspired by a problem that
I read in Barron's AP

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,380
calculus book.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,710
So if I want to draw a bunch of
vectors or a vector field

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,400
that's popping out of the
screen, I could just do the

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,300
top of the arrowheads.

24
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,580
I'll draw them in magenta.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,230
So let's say I have
a vector field.

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,810
So you can imagine
a bunch of arrows

27
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,420
popping out of the screen.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,600
I'll just draw a couple of them
just so you get the sense

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,790
that it's a field.

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,050
It pervades the space.

31
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:32,390
These are a bunch of
arrows popping out.

32
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,320
And the field is popping out.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,650
And the magnitude of the field,
let's say it is, I

34
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,170
don't know, let's say
it is 0.5 teslas.

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,530
Let's say I have some proton
that comes speeding along.

36
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,190
   

37
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,130
And it's speeding along at a
velocity-- so the velocity of

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:04,350
the proton is equal to
6 times 10 to the

39
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,960
seventh meters per second.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,590
And that is actually about 1/5
of the velocity or 1/5 of the

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,340
speed of light.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,060
So we're pretty much in the
relativistic realm, but we

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,180
won't go too much into
relativity because then the

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,910
mass of the proton increases,
et cetera, et cetera.

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,250
We just assume that the mass
hasn't increased significantly

46
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,020
at this point.

47
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,970
So we have this proton going at
a 1/5 of the speed of light

48
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,040
and it's crossing through
this magnetic field.

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,340
So the first question is what is
the magnitude and direction

50
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,980
of the force on this proton
from this magnetic field?

51
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,280
Well, let's figure out the
magnitude first. So how can we

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,320
figure out the magnitude?

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,100
Well, first of all, what is
the charge on a proton?

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,170
Well, we don't know it right
now, but my calculator has

55
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:54,710
that stored in it.

56
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,970
And if you have a TI graphing
calculator, your calculator

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,300
would also have it
stored in it.

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,330
So let's just write that down
as a variable right now.

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,520
So the magnitude of the force on
the particle is going to be

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,110
equal to the charge of a
proton-- I'll call it Q sub

61
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,740
p-- times the magnitude of the
velocity, 6 times 10 to the

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,150
seventh meters per second.

63
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,070
We're using all the
right units.

64
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,560
If this was centimeters
we'd probably want to

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,020
convert it to meters.

66
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,970
6 times 10 to the seventh
meters per second.

67
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,040
And then times the magnitude of
the magnetic field, which

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,590
is 0.5 soon. teslas-- I didn't
have to write the units there,

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,200
but I'll do it there--
times sine of the

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,510
angle between them.

71
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,480
I'll write that down
right now.

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,770
But let me ask you a question.

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,650
If the magnetic field is
pointing straight out of the

74
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,760
screen-- and you're going to
have to do a little bit of

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,320
three-dimensional visualization
now-- and this

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,000
particle is moving in the plane
of the field, what is

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,950
the angle between them?

78
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,280
If you visualize it in three
dimensions, they're actually

79
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,410
orthogonal to each other.

80
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,590
They're at right angles
to each other.

81
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,280
Because these vectors are
popping out of the screen.

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,630
They are perpendicular to the
plane that defines the screen,

83
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,459
while this proton is moving
within this plane.

84
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,050
So the angle between them, if
you can visualize it in three

85
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,530
dimensions, is 90 degrees.

86
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,470
Or they're perfectly
perpendicular.

87
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,660
And when things are perfectly
perpendicular, what is the

88
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,040
sine of 90 degrees?

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Or the sine of pi over 2?

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,330
Either way, if you want
to deal in radians.

91
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,680
Well, it's just equal to 1.

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,690
The whole-- hopefully--
intuition you got about the

93
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,990
cross product is we only want to
multiply the components of

94
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,580
the two vectors that are
perpendicular to each other.

95
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,110
And that's why we have
the sine of theta.

96
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,310
But if the entire vectors are
perpendicular to each other,

97
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,130
then we just multiply the
magnitude of the vector.

98
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,910
Or if you even forget to do
that, you say, oh well,

99
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,930
they're perpendicular.

100
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,900
They're at 90 degree angles.

101
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,870
Sine of 90 degrees?

102
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,470
Well, that's just 1.

103
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,300
So this is just 1.

104
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,900
So the magnitude of the force
is actually pretty easy to

105
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,990
calculate, if we know the
charge on a proton.

106
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,410
And let's see if we can figure
out the charge on a proton.

107
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,490
Let me get the trusty
TI-85 out.

108
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,780
Let me clear there,
just so you can

109
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,460
appreciate the TI-85 store.

110
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,400
If you press second and
constant-- that's second and

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,330
then the number 4.

112
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,950
They have a little constant
above it.

113
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,840
You get their constant
functions.

114
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,590
Or their values.

115
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,590
And you say the built-in--
I care about the built-in

116
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,900
functions, so let me press F1.

117
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,780
And they have a bunch of-- you
know, this is Avogadro's

118
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,760
number, they have a bunch of
interesting-- this is the

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
charge of an electron.

120
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,540
Which is actually the
same thing as

121
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,420
the charge of a proton.

122
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,670
So let's use that.

123
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,980
   

124
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,380
Electrons-- just remember--
electrons and protons have

125
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,210
offsetting charges.

126
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,380
One's positive and
one's negative.

127
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,050
It's just that a proton
is more massive.

128
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,880
That's how they're different.

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,020
And of course, it's positive.

130
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,270
Let's just confirm that that's
the charge of an electron.

131
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,690
But that's also the charge
of a proton.

132
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,830
And actually, this positive
value is the

133
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,240
exact charge of a proton.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,670
They should have maybe put a
negative number here, but all

135
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,180
we care about is the value.

136
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,920
So let's use that again.

137
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,040
The charge of an electron-- and
it is positive, so that's

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,280
the same thing as the charge for
a proton-- times 6 times

139
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,290
10 to the seventh-- 6 E 7, you
just press that EE button on

140
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,790
your calculator-- times
0.5 teslas.

141
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,480
   

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Make sure all your units are
in teslas, meters, and

143
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,380
coulombs, and then your result
will be in newtons.

144
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:49,630
And you get 4.8 times 10 to
the negative 12 newtons.

145
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,950
Let me write that down.

146
00:06:50,950 --> 00:07:03,150
So the magnitude of this force
is equal to 4.8 times 10 to

147
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,610
the minus 12 newtons.

148
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,950
So that's the magnitude.

149
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,760
Now what is the direction?

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,440
What is the direction
of this force?

151
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,750
Well, this you is where we break
out-- we put our pens

152
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,480
down if we're right handed, and
we use our right hand rule

153
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,950
to figure out the direction.

154
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,820
So what do we have to do?

155
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,460
So when you take something
crossed something, the first

156
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,880
thing in the cross product is
your index finger on your

157
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,000
right hand.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,315
And then the second thing is
your middle finger pointed at

159
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:35,570
a right angle with your
index finger.

160
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,930
Let's see if I can do this.

161
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,100
So I want my index finger
on my right hand to

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,930
point to the right.

163
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,070
But I want my middle finger
to point upwards.

164
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,780
Let me see if I can
pull that off.

165
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,220
So my right hand is going to
look something like this.

166
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,470
And my hand is brown.

167
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,070
   

168
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,260
So my right hand is going to
look something like this.

169
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,780
My index finger is pointing in
the direction of the velocity

170
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,990
vector, while my middle finger
is pointing the direction of

171
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,720
the magnetic field.

172
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,030
So my index finger is going to
point straight up, so all you

173
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,510
see is the tip of it.

174
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,860
And then my other fingers are
just going to go like that.

175
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,710
And then my thumb is
going to do what?

176
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,850
My thumb is going-- this is the
heel of my thumb-- and so

177
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,770
my thumb is going to be at a
right angle to both of them.

178
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,470
So my thumb points
down like this.

179
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,909
This is often the
hardest part.

180
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,390
Just making sure you get your
hand visualization right with

181
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,970
the cross product.

182
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:47,680
So just as a review, this
is the direction of v.

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,990
This is the direction of
the magnetic field.

184
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,670
It's popping out.

185
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,830
And so if I arrange my right
hand like that, my thumb

186
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,330
points down.

187
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,560
So this is the direction
of the force.

188
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,860
So as this particle moves to the
right with some velocity,

189
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,120
there's actually going to
be a downward force.

190
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,950
Downward on this plane.

191
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,110
So the force is going to
move in this direction.

192
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,730
So what's going to happen?

193
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,900
Well, what happens-- if you
remember a little bit about

194
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,620
your circular motion and your
centripetal acceleration and

195
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,620
all that-- what happens when you
have a force perpendicular

196
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,060
to velocity?

197
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, think about it.

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,490
If you have a force here and the
velocity is like that, if

199
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,550
the particles-- it'll
be deflected a

200
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,460
little bit to the right.

201
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,820
And then since the force
is always going to be

202
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,030
perpendicular to the velocity
vector, the force is going to

203
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
charge like that.

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,420
So the particle is actually
going to go in a circle.

205
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,750
As long as it's in the magnetic
field, the force

206
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,120
applied to the particle by the
magnetic field is going to be

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,300
perpendicular to the velocity
of the particle.

208
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,150
So the velocity of the
particle-- so it's going to

209
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,660
actually be like a centripetal
force on the particle.

210
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,530
So the particle is going
to go into a circle.

211
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,150
And in the next video we'll
actually figure out the radius

212
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,140
of that circle.

213
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,500
And just one thing I want
to let you think about.

214
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:13,370
It's kind of weird or spooky
to me that the force on a

215
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,660
moving particle-- it doesn't
matter about

216
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,710
the particle's mass.

217
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,500
It just matters the particle's
velocity and charge.

218
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,840
So it's kind of a strange
phenomenon that the faster you

219
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,600
move through a magnetic field--
or at least if you're

220
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,850
charged, if you're a charged
particle-- the faster you move

221
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,560
through a magnetic field, the
more force that magnetic field

222
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,230
is going to apply to you.

223
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,950
It seems a little bit, you know,
how does that magnetic

224
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,420
field know how fast
you're moving?

225
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,030
But anyway, I'll leave
you with that.

226
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,530
In the next video we'll
explore this magnetic

227
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,560
phenomenon a little bit deeper.

228
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,810
See

229
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,000
