1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,782
In the last video we saw how you can actually view a demand curve

2
00:00:03,782 --> 00:00:07,414
as actually a marginal benefit curve

3
00:00:07,414 --> 00:00:11,398
that for any given quantity of the good you're selling

4
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:15,764
that point on the curve is actually showing the marginal benefit for that incremental unit

5
00:00:15,764 --> 00:00:18,065
so this is the marginal benefit for that first unit

6
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:22,114
this is the marginal benefit for that second unit - and there's multiple ways that you can view this

7
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:23,831
assuming that we're talking about this new car here,

8
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:28,097
maybe if you're gonna only sell one unit, someone really wants it really bad

9
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:31,530
the benefit for them, the marginal benefit for that first unit for them,

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,548
is going to be $60,000

11
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:34,597
now let's say

12
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:38,130
if you want to sell 2 units, that 2nd unit might be bought by that same person

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,930
and they might say I already have one car, the benefit of getting that 2nd one is only $50,000

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,765
that's the point at which I am neutral, that's the point at which

15
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,863
I'm right on the fence of wanting to buy that car

16
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:54,130
or it might be another person, another person who's just not as enamoured as the first person that says ok,

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:59,280
for $50,000 I do like that car. and then for the third person there, once again, they're not as enamoured as

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,881
the first two, they would be willing to buy it for $40,000. and what we saw is, at some point that you

19
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:13,097
could say, for whatever reason, the price ends up being $30,000

20
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:16,280
and so when the price is $30,000 we saw

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,163
(and this is kinda doing it in the traditional notion of at a price what quantity we're selling)

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,081
but when you think about that reality, what's actually happening is

23
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:28,264
that this 4th person is right on the fence - their marginal benefit is exactly $30,000

24
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:36,797
so in their mind they're saying "I am giving away $30,000 and in exchange for that I am getting something that's worth $30,000."

25
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:40,231
so it's kind of like, hey would you be willing to trade this dollar for a dollar,

26
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:42,464
well you'd probably be kind of on the fence about that

27
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:47,330
you're very close to going either way - you feel like it's a good deal if you could get it for a penny less

28
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,097
and it's a bad deal if you're getting it for a penny more

29
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:57,113
so right on the fence, but you're gonna just barely get this 4th person to transact at this price

30
00:01:57,113 --> 00:02:00,481
but what we hinted at, is if you have one price for everybody

31
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,097
(and in the future we'll talk about not having one price for everybody)

32
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:10,414
but if you did have one price for everyone, these first units were kind of sold below where they could have been sold

33
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:13,464
they were sold below their marginal benefit

34
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:17,347
so remember, we're doing the same demand curve as a marginal benefit curve

35
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:23,931
so this first unit right over here, it could have been sold at $60,000, but now

36
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:27,114
we're selling it for $30,000

37
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,898
so this right over here, this was $30,000

38
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:32,948
(I'll just write 30 for $30,000)

39
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:37,898
the marginal benefit is $30,000 higher than the actual price

40
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:40,864
the marginal benefit of that unit, the benefit that the market got out of it

41
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,817
is $30,000 higher than the price

42
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:51,997
the marginal benefit for the 2nd unit is $20,000 higher than the price at which the product is being sold

43
00:02:51,997 --> 00:03:01,315
the marginal benefit for this 3rd unit is $10,000

44
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:07,547
or another way to think about it is, the consumer surplus for this first unit was $30,000

45
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:15,380
the consumers got $30,000 more in marginal benefit (value for themselves) than they had to pay for it

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:22,148
here, the consumer surplus was $20,000. the consumer got $20,000 more in value than that 2nd consumer

47
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,947
was willing to pay for it

48
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:27,764
and here's $10,000, and then this 4th consumer is neutral

49
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:31,030
the marginal benefit is what they paid for it

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,715
and so when you think about this, you say

51
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:43,164
"well what's the total consumer surplus here?"

52
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:44,898
and another way of thinking about it is

53
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:48,947
"what's the total excess of marginal benefit above and beyond the price paid?"

54
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:53,947
so how much surplus marginal benefit did they get if you take out the price paid?

55
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:59,130
and over here the total consumer surplus is going to be the $30,000 for that first unit

56
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,963
plus the $20,000 for that 2nd unit

57
00:04:01,963 --> 00:04:07,964
plus the $10,000 for that 3rd unit

58
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,830
and so the total consumer surplus in this scenario

59
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,964
when we sold 4 units at $30,000 is

60
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:17,265
(and we're assuming we're selling cars here - we can't sell parts of cars

61
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:20,296
like 1.1 cars, I guess if we're talking about averages maybe we could

62
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,098
but let's just say that we're selling whole numbers of cars here)

63
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:27,415
the total consumer surplus in this situation is 30 + 20 + 10

64
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:31,080
which is $60,000 (everything's in thousands)

65
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,346
so this is $60,000

66
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:35,797
so in this scenario, in that week, the consumers would get

67
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:43,497
$60,000 more in benefit for them, in perceived benefit for them, than what they actually

68
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:44,948
had to pay for it

69
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,464
and if you think about it

70
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:49,348
it's a little unideal for the seller, because they were

71
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:52,380
selling something at a lower price than maybe what they could have gotten

72
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,446
from at least this first few consumers here

73
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:59,446
and that was because they just had to set one price
