1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,677
As we enter into the 1917

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:07,543
the United States has been able to
maintain its neutrality in WWI,

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,115
in fact President Wilson

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:13,597
has just won a reelection based on the
platform that he kept us <i>out</i> of war

5
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:17,604
and to a large degree 
he was able to keep the US out of war

6
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:22,061
because the German Empire had pulled back 
from its unrestricted submarine warfare

7
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:25,527
after the sinking of the Lusitania 
and how angered America had gotten,

8
00:00:25,588 --> 00:00:28,543
they said: "Okay, we're not gonna 
attack passenger vessels anymore

9
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:30,368
we're only gonna attack things

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,796
that are definitely British non-passenger vessels."

11
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:37,195
But as we go into January of 1917

12
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:42,171
the British blockade 
on the Central Powers was having its effect

13
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:45,146
and the Central Powers were getting
desperate, in particular Germany

14
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:47,574
so they were eager to essentially...

15
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:50,135
uh... do the same to the British once again

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,136
go with the unrestricted submarine warfare

17
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:56,812
but the Germans knew 
that if they were to go back to this

18
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:01,178
that it's likely that the US 
would enter the war on the side of the Allies

19
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,820
so knowing that was likely to happen they said:

20
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,659
"well how could we slow the US down?"

21
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:09,523
and the thinking was 
"well, we could somehow enlist the help of Mexico"

22
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,880
which at the time 
was not on the best terms with the US

23
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,145
and so Arthur Zimmermann...

24
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:19,440
Arthur Zimmermann 
who was the German Foreign Secretary

25
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,636
the equivalent of the United States 
Secretary of State or the foreign minister

26
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,349
Arthur Zimmermann

27
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,923
sends an encoded telegram

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,996
to... the Mexicans

29
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:31,855
and its encoded 
especially because it has to go over lines

30
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:34,656
that are controlled by the Americans.

31
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:40,966
And in it, he actually proposes an alliance 
to slow the Americans down

32
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:44,196
so this is what he wrote...
so this is the encoded telegram

33
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:49,120
and then it was actually 
intercepted and decoded by British intelligence

34
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:51,266
and then shared with the Americans

35
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:55,323
and that was also then made public...
to the American public.

36
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,686
This is actually fascinating to read this stuff,

37
00:01:57,794 --> 00:01:59,821
this is January 1917...

38
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:02,398
this is the Germans talking to the Mexicans:

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,437
"We intend to begin on the first of
February unrestricted submarine warfare.

40
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:13,356
We shall endeavour in spite of this to
keep the United States of America neutral.

41
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:16,286
In the event of this not succeeding,

42
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,269
we make Mexico a proposal of alliance
on the following basis:

43
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:23,439
Make war together, make peace together,

44
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,710
generous financial support,

45
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:31,345
and an understanding on our part that
Mexico is to <i>reconquer</i> the lost territories

46
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:35,775
the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.

47
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:39,280
The settlement in detail his left to you,

48
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:44,824
you'll inform the President 
[the President of Mexico] of the above most secretly

49
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:50,086
as soon as the outbreak of war 
with the United States of America is certain

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,298
and add the suggestion that 
he should, on his own initiative,

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,618
invite Japan to immediate adherence

52
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:59,144
and at the same time mediate 
between Japan and ourselves.

53
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:02,121
Please call the President's attention to the fact

54
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:06,415
that the <i>ruthless</i> employment of our submarines

55
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,745
now offers the prospect of compelling England

56
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,106
in a few months to make peace.

57
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,027
Signed: Zimmermann."

58
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,548
Now, the Mexicans when they read this
they really didn't take it too seriously

59
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,209
they didn't think that they
could seriously engaged the US in a war

60
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:23,070
or they can seriously 
take back our occupied territories

61
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,823
so they didn't really think much of it.

62
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:29,881
The real effect of this telegram was to...
make the American public <i>angry</i>

63
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:33,219
whether they were going to go back into the
unrestricted submarine warfare

64
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:36,283
and the Germans themselves talk about a <i>ruthless</i>...

65
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:39,945
ruthless employment of the submarines.

66
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,819
So when people talk about what were the causes

67
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:45,036
what brought the US into war

68
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,134
the ones that are typically cited are

69
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:51,942
the unrestricted submarine warfare,
the sinking of the Lusitania, 
the Zimmerman telegram ,

70
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:54,155
that was trying to get Mexico

71
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:59,113
to somehow get into a war with the US
and reclaim these territories.

72
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:06,153
And as we'll see a few months after this, 
the US actually <i>does</i> declare war on Germany

73
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,969
and enter into World War One...
