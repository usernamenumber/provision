1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,290
We're all used to the traditional operators like addition and subtraction

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,333
and multiplication and division, and we've seen there's multiple ways to represent this

3
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,327
but what we are going to do in this video is a little bit of fun.

4
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:17,007
We are actually going to define our own operators.

5
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,853
And what's neat about this it kind of shows how broad

6
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:22,175
mathematics can be. And in a more practical sense it is something

7
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:24,600
that you actually might see on some standardized test.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,773
And the reason why they do that is so that you can appreciate

9
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:29,234
that these are not the only operators out there, plus

10
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:32,113
exponentiation and all those, that in mathematics you can define whole

11
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:38,661
new set of operators. Let's just do that. So let me just define x diamond

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:42,841
x diamond y and I'm going to define that as

13
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,531
I'm just gonna define that as 5x minus y. So you

14
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,435
could view this kind of defining a function

15
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,989
but we are defining it using an operator

16
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,333
so if i have x diamond y by definition we've defined

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,596
this operator, that means that's going to be equal to 5x minus y.

18
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:03,733
So given that definition, what would-what would

19
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:08,104
7 diamond 11 be?

20
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:11,308
Well, you just go to the definition. 7 diamond 11

21
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,652
for instead of a x we have 7, so it's going to be

22
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:21,667
5 times 7. Just let me do 5 times 7 minus, and instead

23
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:23,940
of a y, we have an 11.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,655
So one way to think about it is every--in our definition

25
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:28,933
every place you saw a x you can replace with 7

26
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:31,324
and every place you saw y, you replace with 11.

27
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:36,850
So you have minus 11 over here. So this is the 7

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,312
This 7 is this 7

29
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:44,977
and this 11--this 11 is this 11 right over here.

30
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:48,182
And then we just evaluate that. So 5 times 7 is 35,

31
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:53,847
So this is equal to 35, minus 11, which is equal to 24

32
00:01:53,847 --> 00:02:00,163
So 7 star--or not, this isn't a star--7 diamond 11 is equal to 24.

33
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,835
We can define other things.

34
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:05,690
We can define something crazy like--let me define

35
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,848
a--well I mentioned a star, let me use a star

36
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,656
a star-- a -- write it this way

37
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:19,250
a star b--let's say that is the same thing as-- I don't know

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,733
a over a plus b. So it's the same idea

39
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:29,002
What would,

40
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:32,996
5 star --5 star 6 be?

41
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,690
Well you go back to the definition. By definition

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,337
every place you see a you would now replace with 5

43
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,938
every time you'd see b, you'd now replace with 6

44
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:47,253
this is going to be equal to 5 over 5 plus 6

45
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,647
a plus b

46
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,643
a is 5, b is 6

47
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:53,012
over 5 plus 6

48
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,009
so this would be 5/11

49
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,656
5/11. And then you can compound them.

50
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:01,000
We haven't defined and order of operations for these particular

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,733
operations we just have defined.

52
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,900
So we are going to be careful to use parentheses

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,687
when we do, when we put some of these together.

54
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,334
But you could do something like, something interesting

55
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:21,990
like -1 diamond--negative 1 diamond 0 star--0 star 5

56
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,845
and once again we just focus on parentheses, because

57
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:27,981
that is the only thing that is telling us what to start on first

58
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,653
because we haven't, we haven't figured out

59
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:32,161
we haven't defined whether diamond takes precedence over

60
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:34,251
star or star takes precedence over diamond.

61
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:37,501
The way we have that thing saying hey, you do multiplication before you do addition

62
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,667
we haven't defined it for those operations.

63
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,984
But that's what parentheses help us do.

64
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:43,585
So we want to evaluate the parentheses first.

65
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:49,669
0 star 5, that is 0, because so now this you can zero as the a

66
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,991
and the 5 as the b

67
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:58,724
this is going to be 0 over 0 plus 5. Over 0 plus 5.

68
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:04,067
which is just going to be 0. So this is just goes to 0.

69
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:08,067
So this whole expression simplifies to negative 1 diamond

70
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,000
this diamond right over here

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,421
diamond 0. And now we go to the definition of the

72
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,043
diamond operator. Well that's five times first, the first number

73
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:21,666
in our operator. The first term we are giving the operator

74
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,059
I guess you can think of it that way.

75
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:28,167
So 5 times that, so that will be 5 times negative 1

76
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,328
x is negative 1

77
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:33,972
minus y. Well y here is the zero. Minus 0

78
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:39,406
So 5 times negative 1. 5 times negative 1 is negative 5

79
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:44,235
And you will see and the idea is just to make you feel comfortable

80
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:47,393
defining new operators like this, and not feel being daunted

81
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:48,833
if you all of a sudden see a diamond. And they are

82
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,994
defined the diamond for you

83
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:53,059
and you are like you never saw a diamond. They are actually defining it for you

84
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,406
So you shouldn't say I never saw a diamond.

85
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:56,403
You'll just say, oh well they have defined diamond for me

86
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:59,746
this is how I use that operator. And sometimes you'll see even wackier things.

87
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:05,969
You'll see things like, let me draw

88
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:11,496
So they'll define. So this is, I don't know if you'd even consider this as an operator.

89
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:15,907
By definiton, if somebody writes a symbol like this

90
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:20,412
and they put an a b c--let me write this way

91
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:25,242
a, b, c, d. They'll say this is the same thing as

92
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:29,067
ad minus b, all of that over c.

93
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,418
And once again, this is just a definition.

94
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:35,067
They have this weird symbolic way of representing these variables

95
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:39,133
but they are just defining how (do) you evaluate this crazy expression.

96
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:44,979
And so if someone were to give you, say evaluate this diamond

97
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,391
evaluate this diamond--let me evaluate the diamond

98
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,267
so evaluate the diamond where in my little sections of the diamond I have a

99
00:05:54,267 --> 00:06:01,651
negative 1, a five, a three and a two. And we would just use the definition of how we evaluate the diamond.

100
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:05,412
And we'd say every time we see an a, we say that's negative 1

101
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:13,168
so we have negative 1 times d, well d. Well d is whatever is in the bottom right section of this

102
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,419
diamond or this kite. So d is going to be 2. Let me write this this way.

103
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,069
This is a.

104
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:18,400
This is b.

105
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,716
This is c.

106
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:21,574
and this is d.

107
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,570
So this is going to be negative 1

108
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,053
times 2, minus b

109
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,075
Well b is 5

110
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,400
minus five

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,047
all of that over c,

112
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:32,394
which is 3.

113
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,298
So this is going to be equal to negative 2

114
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:40,242
minus 5. So that is negative 7. Negative 7 over 3.

115
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:43,261
And you can go crazy like this. And it might be a fun thing actually

116
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,400
if you have some spare time.

117
00:06:44,400 --> 99:59:59,999
Define your own operators and see how creative you can be with those operators.
