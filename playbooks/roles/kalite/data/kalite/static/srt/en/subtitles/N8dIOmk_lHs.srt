00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:04,714
What I want to do in this video is order these fractions from least to greatest

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:10,379
And, the easiest way--and the way that people are sure to get the right answer--

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,002
is to find a common denominator, because if we can't find a common denominator,

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:21,432
these fractions are difficult to compare: 4/9 v. 3/4 v. 4/5, 11/12, 13/15.

5
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:25,844
You can try to estimate them, but you'll be able to directly compare them if

6
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:32,467
they all have the same denominator. So, the trick here is to first find the common denominator.

7
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:36,432
And there is many ways to do it, you could just pick one of these numbers,

8
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:42,051
and take all of its multiples until you find a multiple that is divisible by all of the rest.

9
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:45,667
Another way to do it is to look at the prime factorization of each of these numbers.

10
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:52,067
and then the 'least common multiple' of them would have each of those prime numbers in it.

11
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:58,630
Let's do it that second way, and then verify it.

12
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:08,429
So, 9 is 3<i>3, so our LCM is going to have at least one 3</i>3 in it.

13
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:12,191
And then 4 is the same thing as 2*2.

14
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:17,810
So, we will also have 2*2 in our prime factorization (LCM).

15
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,361
5 is a prime number, so we'll put 5 right there.

16
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:31,185
And then, 12 is the same thing as 2<i>6, and 6 = 2</i>3.

17
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:40,867
So, in our LCM, we have to have two 2's, but we already have two 2's, and we already have one 3.

18
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:48,182
Another way to think about it, is that something that is divisible by both 9 and 4

19
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,200
is going to be divisible by 12.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:58,770
And then finally, we need it to be divisible by 15's prime factors.

21
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,971
15 is the same thing as 3*5.

22
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:09,312
So once again, we already have 3 and 5.

23
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:15,163
So, this is our least common multiple (LCM).

24
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:45,256
So, LCM is going to be equal to 3<i>3</i>2<i>2</i>5 =180

25
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:52,873
So, our LCM is 180. So, we want to rewrite all of these fractions with 180 in the denominator.

26
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:59,467
So, our first fraction, 4/9, is what over 180?

27
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:04,065
To go from 9 to 180, we have to multiple 9 by 20.

28
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:16,836
So, to get the denominator to equal 180, we multiple by 20.

29
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:21,851
Since we don't want to change the value of the fraction, we should also multiple by the 4 by 20.

30
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:28,863
4*20 = 80. So, 4/9 is the same thing as 80/180.

31
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:37,200
Now, let's do 3/4. What do we have to multiple the denominator by to equal 180?

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,656
You can divide 4 into 180 (180/4 = x) to figure that out.

33
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:54,452
4*45 = 180. Now, you also have to multiple the numerator by 45.

34
00:03:54,452 --> 00:04:09,200
3*45 = 135. So, 3/4 equals 135/180.

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:31,929
Now let's do 4/5. To get 180 from 5, multiple 5 by 36.

36
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:35,133
Have to multiple numerator by same number, 36.

37
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:46,325
So, 144/180.

38
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:50,180
And then we have only two more to do.

39
00:04:50,180 --> 00:05:25,846
180/12 = 15. Same for numerator, 15. So, 11/12 = 165/180.

40
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,067
And then finally, we have 13/15.

41
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:51,434
To get 180 from 15, multiply 15 by 12--15<i>10 = 150, 30 remaining for 180. 15</i>2 = 30. So, 15*12 = 180.

42
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,128
Multiple numerator by same number, 13.

43
00:05:54,128 --> 00:06:01,233
We know 12*12 = 144, so just add one more 12 = 156.

44
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:08,431
So, we've rewritten each of these fractions with the new common denominator.

45
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:13,029
Now, it is very easy to compare them. We only have to look at their numerators.

46
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:21,434
Foe example, the smallest numerator is 80, so 4/9 is the least of these numbers.

47
00:06:21,434 --> 00:07:04,438
The next smallest number looks like 135, which was 3/4.

48
00:07:04,438 --> 00:07:08,524
And then the next one is going to be the 144/180, which was 4/5.

49
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:20,831
Next is 156/180, which was 13/15.

50
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:35,970
Finally, we have 165/180, which was 11/12.

51
00:07:35,970 --> 99:59:59,999
And, we're done! We have finished our ordering.
