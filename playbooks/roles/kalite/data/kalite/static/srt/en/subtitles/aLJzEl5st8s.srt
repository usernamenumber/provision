00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:13,038
The Forces on an Airplane

2
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:16,222
So this is an airplane here. Ok.

3
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,405
You probably already knew that.

4
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:21,509
If you've flown in one or maybe you just seen them fly.

5
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:26,876
But, even if you've seen them or been in one, do you know how they work?

6
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,171
Is it magic? Wingavium Leviosa.

7
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,227
Are there invisible fairies that hold the plane aloft?

8
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:36,961
Alright men, we've got a busy morning and lots of flights to carry.

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,802
Or is it science?

10
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:43,796
Well, you guess that the answer is indeed science.

11
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:44,891
That's ridiculous!

12
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,753
What?!

13
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,220
[Hand slap]

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,415
So to discuss how an airplane flies, we first have to talk about the forces on an airplane

15
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:56,931
which push it around in all sorts of different directions.

16
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,177
Now we are going to focus on airplnes today

17
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,909
because they're awesome!

18
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,930
But, most of these forces apply

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,263
to any other vehicle

20
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,716
The first force acts on all these vehicles

21
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,336
really it acts on everything

22
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:14,100
its the weight force which points down

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,655
towards the center of earth

24
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:22,559
Weight is equal to the mass of the airplane - (M) right here.

25
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:25,365
Times the acceleration due to gravity (g)

26
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:31,510
Here on earth, (g) is equal to 9.81 meters per second squared.

27
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,361
Now that is only for earth.

28
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:39,450
The acceleration due to gravity really depends on the mass of the planet that you're on.

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,640
The larger the planet, the higher the gravity.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,468
So, 9.81 meters per second squared here on earth

31
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:48,513
The moon however, is smaller than earth.

32
00:01:48,513 --> 00:01:52,936
So the acceleration due to gravity is only one sixth that on earth.

33
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:55,746
So one point six meters per second squared.

34
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:59,209
This is why astronauts can bounce high on the moon

35
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,992
but not on earth

36
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:04,761
This isn't nearly as much fun.

37
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:09,583
Obviously, there has to be another force opposing the weight and pushing the airplane up

38
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:13,251
This force is called lift

39
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:17,335
Lift operates perpendicular to the airplane's wings

40
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,904
which are right here in this side view

41
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:25,903
Now if these are the only two forces then our aircraft only be able to go up and down

42
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:28,162
but it won't go anywhere

43
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:32,033
So, we're going to have a force that pushes the airplane forward

44
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:36,678
And this is called thrust.

45
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:40,643
All vehicles have thrust otherwise they wouldn't go anywhere like our airplane

46
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:43,400
Why didn't you buy a car with thurst?

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,798
I'm sorry, we can at least roll down the hill.

48
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:47,846
[Huff]

49
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:51,551
On an aircraft this thurst is produced by engines

50
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,180
There are two main types of engines

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,412
there are propellers, like this little guy right here.

52
00:02:57,412 --> 00:03:02,464
And jet engines like our first model.

53
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,462
Whatever the type of engines, they all work by the same principle

54
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:09,927
So we draw a little side view of an engine here

55
00:03:09,927 --> 00:03:15,083
The engines accelerate air out the back, this direction

56
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,475
and by Newton's third law

57
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:20,220
there is an equal and opposite reaction

58
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:25,008
And that's the thurst force pushing the aircraft forward

59
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:28,727
This is really the same thing that happens when you blow up a balloon and let it go

60
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:32,744
The air comes out the back and the balloon moves forward

61
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:37,991
We have a force that opposes the thrust, its call drag.

62
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,325
It points opposite the direction of flight.

63
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,211
The major type of drag is pressure drag

64
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:48,680
which is the force caused by the air smacking into the airplane.

65
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,531
So we try to minimize this type of drag by making the airplane as areodynamic as possible.

66
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,151
This means that it has smooth lines

67
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:00,444
and the air flows nice and cleanly over the front here

68
00:04:00,444 --> 00:04:04,882
You can feel the pressure drag when you stick your hand out of the window of a moving car

69
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:09,078
Ah, honey, honey, your hand, your hand please.

70
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:13,315
When your hand is horizontal its areodynamic, and you really don't feel alot of drag.

71
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:16,081
But if slowly turn your hand vertical,

72
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,774
you can really feel the drag increasing.

73
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:23,232
So these are our four forces on the airplane

74
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:24,827
but perhaps your're thinking

75
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:29,276
So this really cool and everything, but how do we increase and decrease the airplane's lift

76
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:31,013
to move up and down?

77
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,227
That's a great question

78
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:36,544
Let's look at the equation for the magnitude lift per unit wing area

79
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:37,934
we'll call that (L).

80
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:45,876
L equals one half times rau times CL times V squared.

81
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,126
It's that simple.

82
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:52,076
Ok, ok. I'll tell you what each of these things mean.

83
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,812
So rau, its not a P is the greek letter rau.

84
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:57,848
Rau is the density of the air,

85
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:01,764
which is a measure of the number of air molecules in a certain volume.

86
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:06,343
Density of the air varies with altitude and temperature.

87
00:05:06,343 --> 00:05:09,763
So if you go higher up the air is thinner,

88
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,850
so the density is lower.

89
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,399
So if you want to simplify things we generally use standard density,

90
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:24,329
which is one point two seven five four kilograms per meters cubed.

91
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:26,716
(V) here is the speed of the aircraft or

92
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:33,197
fast its traveling. And (C)(L) is something called the coeffecient of lift.

93
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:38,227
Its a number that gives us some information about the shape of the aircraft's wings

94
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,583
These things right here.

95
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:44,536
The coeffecieint of lift changes with the angel of attack.

96
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:45,926
Angle of what?

97
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:49,334
An aircraft can pitch up and down.

98
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:55,723
And even if they pitch up, they are still traveling in a horizontal direction, like that.

99
00:05:55,723 --> 00:06:00,855
Now, the angle formed here by the horizontal direction from travel,

100
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,363
and the direction of the aircraft's nose,

101
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,032
is called the angle of attack.

102
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,451
And we denote that with the greek letter alpha.

103
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:13,003
So we can make a little plot here of that.

104
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:16,849
We're going to put the coeffecient of lift up on the Y axis.

105
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:21,295
And the angle of attack, down on the x axis.

106
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:25,910
So as the airplane starts to pitch up, if I can get a little hand here.

107
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,416
Thank you.

108
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,345
So as the aircraft starts to pitch up, the coeffecient of lift increases.

109
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:32,895
This is a good thing because

110
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:35,141
we have more lift.

111
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:41,333
As we continue to increase we eventually reach a point where we keep pitching up

112
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,665
but the lift starts decreasing.

113
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:48,375
This is something called stall, and its

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,201
not a good thing.

115
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,611
So we generally try not to pitch up this much.

116
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:58,125
There is a similar equation for the drag per unit wing area (D).

117
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:05,343
D equals one half rau, not CL, that wouldn't make any sense, but CD.

118
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:10,307
As you can guess, its the coeffeiceint of drag times the velocity squared.

119
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:15,253
The coeffeiceint of drag is another number that tells us something about the wings.

120
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:18,656
And its also varies with the angle of attack.

121
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:22,792
So as the angle of attack increases...Oh, thank you

122
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,663
The coefficient of drag increases as well.

123
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,282
Thank you very much.

124
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,212
This is because as the aircraft is pitching up

125
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:40,380
there is more wing area perpendicular to the flow.

126
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,717
Now this reminds me of somehting that we talked about earlier.

127
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:45,733
Exactly.

128
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:51,047
This is very similar to whenever you hold your hand out the window of a car.

129
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:56,959
And so, that's pretty much everything you need to know

130
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,514
about how an aircraft flies.

131
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:02,506
So the next time you're on an airplane or you've just seen one

132
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:07,343
you really know exactly what is that's keeping it up in the air.

133
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,895
Nope.

134
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:10,508
That's not it either.

135
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:11,871
Ah...there you go.

136
00:08:11,871 --> 99:59:59,999
Now you've got it.
