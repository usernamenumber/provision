1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,100
Let's do another problem from
the normal distribution

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,120
section of ck12.org's
AP statistics book.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,770
And I'm using theirs because
it's Open Source and it's

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,990
actually quite a good book.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,475
The problems are, I think,
good practice for us.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,070
So let's see, number 3.

7
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,390
You could go to their
site and I think you

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,690
can download the book.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,180
Assume that the mean eight of 1
year old girls in the U.S. is a

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,920
normally distributed-- or is
normally distributed with the

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,330
mean of about 9.5 grams.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,820
That's got to be kilograms.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,930
I have a 10 month old son
and he weighs about 20

14
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,570
pounds which is about 9
kilograms not 9.5 grams.

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,040
9.5 grams is nothing.

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,900
This would be talking about
like mice or something.

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,940
This has got to be kilograms.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,350
But anyway, it's about
9.5 kilograms with a

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,050
standard deviation of
approximately 1.1 grams.

20
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,400
So the mean is equal to 9.5
kilograms I'm assuming and

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,130
the standard deviation
is equal to 1.1 grams.

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,840
Without using a calculator-- so
that's an interesting clue--

23
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,950
estimate the percentage of 1
year old girls in the U.S. that

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,995
meet the following conditions.

25
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,910
So when they say that without a
calculator estimate that's a

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,250
big clue or a big giveaway that
we're supposed to use

27
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,350
the empirical rule.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,480
Empirical rule sometimes
called the 68-95-99.7 rule.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
And if you remember this
is the name of the rule

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,500
you've essentially
remembered the rule.

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,520
What that tells us that if we
have a normal distribution--

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,800
I'll do a bit of a review
here before we jump

33
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,750
into this problem.

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,750
If we have a normal
distribution-- let me draw

35
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,480
a normal distribution.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,900
It looks like that.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,240
That's my normal distribution.

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,940
I didn't draw it perfectly
but you get the idea.

39
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,560
It should be symmetrical.

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,980
This is our mean right there.

41
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,840
That's our mean.

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,810
If we go one standard deviation
above the mean and one standard

43
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,350
deviation below the mean,
so this is our mean plus

44
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,780
one standard deviation.

45
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,730
This is our mean minus
one standard deviation.

46
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,710
The probability of finding a
result if we're dealing with a

47
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,080
perfect normal distribution
that's between one standard

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
deviation below the mean and
one standard deviation above

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,320
the mean-- that would be this
area-- and it would be,

50
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,040
you could guess, 68%.

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,430
68% chance you're going to get
something within one standard

52
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,750
deviation of the mean.

53
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,140
Either a standard deviation
below or above or

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,450
anywhere in between.

55
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,500
Now, if we're talking about two
standard deviations around the

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,170
mean-- so if we go down another
standard deviation, we go down

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,570
another standard deviation in
that direction and another

58
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,780
standard deviation above the
mean-- and we were to ask

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,190
ourselves what's the
probability of finding

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,360
something within those two or
within that range, then it's,

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,740
you could guess it, 95%.

62
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,060
And that includes this
middle area right here.

63
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,510
So the 68% is a
subset of that 95%.

64
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,140
And I think you know
where this is going.

65
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,360
If we go three standard
deviations below the mean and

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,820
above the mean, the empirical
rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule

67
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,740
tells us that there is a 99.7%
chance of finding a result in a

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,120
normal distribution that is
within three standard

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,110
deviations of the mean.

70
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,230
So above three standard
deviations below the mean

71
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,030
and below three standard
deviation above the mean.

72
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,870
That's what the empirical
rule tells us.

73
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,960
Now let's see if we can
apply it to this problem.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,140
So they gave us the mean and
the standard deviation.

75
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,550
Let me draw that out.

76
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,550
Let me draw my axis
first as best as I can.

77
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,600
That's my axis.

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,410
Let me draw my bell curve.

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,090
That's about as good as a
bell curve as you can expect

80
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,920
a freehand drawer to do.

81
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,140
And the mean here is 9.-- and
this should be symmetric.

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,710
This height should be the
same as that height there.

83
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,600
I think you get the idea.

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,260
I'm not a computer.

85
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,390
9.5 is the mean.

86
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,370
I won't write the units.

87
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,580
It's all in kilograms.

88
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,330
One standard deviation above
the mean we should add 1.1 to

89
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,220
that because they told us the
standard deviation is 1.1.

90
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,820
That's going to be 10.6.

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,620
If we go-- let me just draw a
little dotted line there-- 1

92
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,990
standard deviation below the
mean we're going it subtract

93
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:34,110
1.1 from 9.5 and so
that would be 8.4.

94
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,620
If we go two standard
deviations above the mean

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,400
we would add another
standard deviation here.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,610
Right?

97
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,890
We went one standard
deviations, two

98
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,700
standard deviations.

99
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,435
That would get us to 11.7.

100
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:47,040
And if we were to go three
standard deviations

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,910
we'd add 1.1 again.

102
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,720
That would get us to 12.8.

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,820
Doing it on the other side,
one standard deviation

104
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,380
below the mean is 8.4.

105
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,480
Two standard deviations below
the mean-- subtract 1.1

106
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,910
again-- would be 7.3.

107
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,380
And then three standard
deviations below the mean--

108
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,280
which we'd write there--
would be 6.2 kilograms.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,860
So that's our set up
for the problem.

110
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,070
So what's the probability that
we would find a one year old

111
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,730
girl in the U.S. that weighs
less than 8.4 kilograms.

112
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,330
Or maybe I should say
whose mass is less

113
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,640
than 8.4 kilograms.

114
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,150
So if we look here, the
probability of finding a baby

115
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,070
or a female baby who is one
year old with a mass or a

116
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,920
weight of less than 8.4
kilograms, that's this

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,610
area right here.

118
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,070
I said mass because kilograms
is actually a unit of mass.

119
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,940
Most people use it
as weight as well.

120
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,470
So that's that
area right there.

121
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,950
So how can we figure out
that area under this

122
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,900
normal distribution using
the empirical rule?

123
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,280
Well, we know what
this area is.

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,370
We know what this area between
minus one standard deviation

125
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,500
and plus one standard
deviation is.

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,920
We know that is 68%.

127
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,720
And if that's 68% then that
means in the parts that

128
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,360
aren't in that middle
region you have 32%.

129
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,200
Because the area under the
entire normal distribution is

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,380
100 or 100% or 1, depending on
how you want to think about it.

131
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,490
Because you can't have-- well,
all of the possibilities

132
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,880
combined can only add up to 1.

133
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,480
You can't have it more
than 100% there.

134
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,270
So if you add up this leg and
this leg-- so this plus that

135
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,490
leg is going to be
the remainder.

136
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,590
So 100 minus 68, that's 32.

137
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,920
32%.

138
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,820
32% is if you add up
this left leg and this

139
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,240
right leg over here.

140
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
And this is a perfect
normal distribution.

141
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,535
They told us it's
normally distributed.

142
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,780
So it's going to be
perfectly symmetrical.

143
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,730
So if this side and that side
add up to 32 but they're both

144
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,820
symmetrical, meaning they have
the exact same area, then this

145
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,490
side right here-- I'll do it in
pink-- this side right here--

146
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,020
it ended up looking more
like purple-- would be 16%.

147
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,700
And this side right
here would be 16%.

148
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,900
So your probability of getting
a result more than one standard

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,280
deviation above the mean-- so
that's this right hand

150
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,760
side, would be 16%.

151
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,040
Or the probability of having a
result less than one standard

152
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,050
deviation below that mean,
that's this right here, 16%.

153
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,060
So they want to know the
probability of having a

154
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,140
baby at one years old
less than 8.4 kilograms.

155
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,970
Less than 8.4 kilograms
is this area right here.

156
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,500
And that's 16%.

157
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,270
So that's 16% for part a.

158
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,280
Let's do part b: between 7.3
and 11.7 point seven kilograms.

159
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,130
So between 7.3--
that's right there.

160
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,120
That's two standard deviations
below the mean-- and 11.7, one,

161
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,100
two standard deviations
above the mean.

162
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,260
So there's essentially asking
us what's the probability of

163
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,340
getting a result within two
standard deviations

164
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,230
of the mean, right?

165
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,040
This is the mean right here.

166
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,250
This is two standard
deviations below.

167
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,630
This is two standard
deviations above.

168
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,130
Well that's pretty
straightforward.

169
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,490
The empirical rule tells us
between two standard deviations

170
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,950
you have a 95% chance of
getting a result that is within

171
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,140
two standard deviations.

172
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,740
So the empirical rule just
gives us that answer.

173
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,440
And then finally, part c: the
probability of having a one

174
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,510
year old U.S. a baby girl
more than 12.8 kilograms.

175
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,310
So 12.8 kilograms is three
standard deviations

176
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,770
above the mean.

177
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,100
So we want to know the
probability of having a result

178
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,250
more than three deviations
above the mean.

179
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:42,170
So that is this area way out
there that I drew in orange.

180
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,310
Maybe I should do it in
a different color to

181
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,280
really contrast it.

182
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,575
So it's this long tail out
here, this little small area.

183
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,020
So what is that probability?

184
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,420
So let's turn back to
our empirical rule.

185
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,230
Well we know the probability--
we know this area.

186
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,740
We know the area between minus
three standard deviations and

187
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,960
plus three standard deviations.

188
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,090
We know this-- since this is
last the last problem I can

189
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,200
color the whole thing in-- we
know this area right here

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,300
between minus 3 and plus
3, that is it 99.7%.

191
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,830
The bulk of the results
fall under there.

192
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,940
I mean, almost all of them.

193
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,320
So what do we have left
over for the two tails?

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,220
Remember there are two tails.

195
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,330
This is one of them.

196
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,630
Then you have the results that
are less than three standard

197
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,730
deviations below the mean.

198
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,480
This tail right there.

199
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,160
So that tells us that this,
less than three standard

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,280
deviations below the mean and
more than three standard

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,150
deviations above the mean
combined have to be the rest.

202
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:46,530
Well the rest, there's only
0.3% percent for the rest.

203
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,250
And these two things
are symmetrical.

204
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,620
They're going to be equal.

205
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,880
So this right here has to be
half of this or 0.15% and

206
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,160
this right here is
going to be 0.15%.

207
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,650
So the probability of having a
one year old baby girl in the

208
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,250
U.S. that is more than 12.8
kilograms if you assume a

209
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,490
perfectly normal distribution
is the area under this curve,

210
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,040
the area that is more than
three standard deviations

211
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,250
above the mean.

212
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:21,760
And that is 0.15%.

213
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,410
Anyway, I hope you
found that useful.
