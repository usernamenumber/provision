1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
   

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,430
I think it's very important to
have as many ways as possible

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,450
to view a certain type of
problem, so I want to introduce

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,410
you to a different way.

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,710
Some people might have taught
this first, but the way I

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,850
taught it in the first integral
video is kind of the way that I

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,100
always think about when
I do the problems.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,330
But sometimes, it's more useful
to think about it the way I'm

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,030
about to show you, and maybe
you won't see the difference,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,530
or maybe you'll say, oh, Sal,
those are just the

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,010
exact same thing.

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,420
Someone actually emailed me and
told me that I should make it

13
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,360
so I can scroll things, and I
said, oh, that's not

14
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,810
too hard to do.

15
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,140
So I just did that, and
I scrolled my drawing.

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,820
But anyway, let's say we have
a surface in 3 dimensions.

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,120
It's a function of x and y.

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,060
You give me a coordinate down
here, and I'll tell you

19
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,240
how high the surface
is at that point.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,330
And we want to figure out the
volume under that surface.

21
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,880
So.

22
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,360
We can very easily figure out
the volume of a very small

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,210
column underneath the surface.

24
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,870
So this whole volume is what
we're trying to figure out,

25
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,020
right, between the
dotted lines.

26
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,050
I think you can see it.

27
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,730
You have some experience
visualizing this right now.

28
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,940
So let's say that I have
a little area here.

29
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,550
We could call that da.

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,240
Let me see if I can draw this.

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,430
Let's say we have a little
area down here, a little

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,780
square in the x-y plane.

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,580
And it's, depending on how you
view it, this side of it is dx,

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,480
its length is dx, and the
height, you could say,

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,700
on that side, is dy.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,390
Right?

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,100
Because it's a little small
change in y there, and it's a

38
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,490
little small change in x here.

39
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,060
And its area, the area of
this little square, is

40
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,800
going to be dx times dy.

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,720
And if we wanted to figure out
the volume of the solid between

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,090
this little area and the
surface, we could just multiply

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,940
this area times the function.

44
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,250
Right?

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,210
Because the height at this
point is going to be the

46
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,090
value of the function,
roughly, at this point.

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,300
Right?

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,640
This is going to be an
approximation, and then we're

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,450
going to take an infinite sum.

50
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,220
I think you know
where this is going.

51
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,170
But let me do that.

52
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,480
Let me at least draw the little
column that I want to show you.

53
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,690
So that's one end of it, that's
another end of it, that's the

54
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,840
front end of it, that's
the other end of it.

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,660
So we have a little figure that
looks something like that.

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,180
A little column, right?

57
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,400
It intersects the
top of the surface.

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,950
And the volume of this
column, not too difficult.

59
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,420
It's going to be this little
area down here, which is,

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,360
we could call that da.

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,870
   

62
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,300
Sometimes written
like that. da.

63
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,565
It's a little area.

64
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:47,890
And we're going to multiply
that area times the height of

65
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,280
this column, and that's the
function at that point.

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,260
So it's f of x and y.

67
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,970
And of course, we could have
also written it as, this

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,590
da is just dx times
dy, or dy times dx.

69
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm going to write it in
every different way.

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,260
So we could also have
written this as f of

71
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,510
xy times dx times dy.

72
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,730
And of course, since
multiplication is associative,

73
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:21,140
I could have also written it as
f of xy times dy dx.

74
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,270
These are all equivalent, and
these all represent the volume

75
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,010
of this column, that's the
between this little area

76
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,550
here and the surface.

77
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,980
So now, if we wanted to figure
out the volume of the entire

78
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,850
surface, we have a couple
of things we could do.

79
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,120
We could add up all of the
volumes in the x-direction,

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,230
between the lower x-bound and
the upper x-bound, and then

81
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,330
we'd have kind of a thin sheet,
although it will already have

82
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,710
some depth, because we're
not adding up just the x's.

83
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,060
There's also a dy back there.

84
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,870
So we would have a volume of a
figure that would extend from

85
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,170
the lower x all the way to the
upper x, go back dy,

86
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,210
and come back here.

87
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,390
If we wanted to sum
up all the dx's.

88
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,050
And if we wanted to do that,
which expression would we use?

89
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,800
Well, we would be summing with
respect to x first, so we could

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,040
use this expression, right?

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,630
   

92
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,035
And actually, we could
write it here, but it

93
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:21,970
just becomes confusing.

94
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,880
If we're summing with respect
to x, but we have the

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,110
dy written here first.

96
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,430
It's really not incorrect, but
it just becomes a little

97
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,740
ambiguous, are we summing
with respect to x or y.

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,430
But here, we could say, OK.

99
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,140
If we want to sum up all the
dx's first, let's do that.

100
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,890
We're taking the sum with
respect to x, and let me, I'm

101
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,270
going to write down the actual,
normally I just write numbers

102
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,210
here, but I'm going to say,
well, the lower bound here is x

103
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:51,320
is equal to a, and the upper
bound here is x is equal to b.

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,650
   

105
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,380
And that'll give us the volume
of, you could imagine a

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,330
sheet with depth, right?

107
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,760
The sheet is going to be
parallel to the x-axis, right?

108
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,060
And then once we have that
sheet, in my video, I think

109
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,280
that's the newspaper people
trying to sell me something.

110
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,040
Anyway.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,470
So once we have the sheet, I'll
try to draw it here, too, I

112
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,930
don't want to get this picture
too muddied up, but once we

113
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,010
have that sheet, then we can
integrate those, we can

114
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,360
add up the dy's, right?

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
Because this width right
here is still dy.

116
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,300
We could add up of all the
different dy's, and we

117
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,390
would have the volume
of the whole figure.

118
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,910
So once we take this sum,
then we could take this sum.

119
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,320
Where y is going from it's
bottom, which we said with c,

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,230
from y is equal to c to y's
upper bound, to y

121
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,070
is equal to d.

122
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,690
Fair enough.

123
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,340
And then, once we evaluate
this whole thing, we have the

124
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,520
volume of this solid, or the
volume under the surface.

125
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,330
Now we could have
gone the other way.

126
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,810
I know this gets a little
bit messy, but I think

127
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,840
you get what I'm saying.

128
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,185
Let's start with that little
da we had originally.

129
00:05:57,185 --> 00:06:00,280
   

130
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,520
Instead of going this way,
instead of summing up the dx's

131
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,910
and getting this sheet, let's
sum up the dy's first, right?

132
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,570
So we could take, we're summing
in the y-direction first.

133
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,420
We would get a sheet that's
parallel to the y-axis, now.

134
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,770
So the top of the sheet would
look something like that.

135
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,705
So if we're coming the dy's
first, we would take the sum,

136
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:28,780
we would take the integral with
respect to y, and it would be,

137
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,460
the lower bound would be y is
equal to c, and the upper

138
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,600
bound is y is equal to d.

139
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,346
And then we would have that
sheet with a little depth, the

140
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:44,790
depth is dx, and then we could
take the sum of all of those,

141
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,580
sorry, my throat is dry.

142
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,290
I just had a bunch of almonds
to get power to be able

143
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,070
to record these videos.

144
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,230
But once I have one of these
sheets, and if I want to sum up

145
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,180
all of the x's, then I could
take the infinite sum of

146
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,520
infinitely small columns, or in
this view, sheets, infinitely

147
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,200
small depths, and the lower
bound is x is equal to a, and

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,100
the upper bound is
x is equal to b.

149
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,660
And once again, I would have
the volume of the figure.

150
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,930
And all I showed you here is
that there's two ways of doing

151
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,790
the order of integration.

152
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,060
Now, another way of saying
this, if this little original

153
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,190
square was da, and this is a
shorthand that you'll see all

154
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,300
the time, especially in
physics textbooks, is that we

155
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,440
are integrating along
the domain, right?

156
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,770
Because the x-y plane
here is our domain.

157
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,690
So we're going to do a double
integral, a two-dimensional

158
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,132
integral, we're saying that the
domain here is two-dimensional,

159
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:48,110
and we're going to take that
over f of x and y times da.

160
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,240
And the reason why I want to
show you this, is you see this

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,830
in physics books all the time.

162
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,300
I don't think it's a
great thing to do.

163
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,860
Because it is a shorthand, and
maybe it looks simpler, but for

164
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,920
me, whenever I see something
that I don't know how to

165
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,180
compute or that's not obvious
for me to know how to compute,

166
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,320
it actually is more confusing.

167
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,260
So I wanted to just show you
that what you see in this

168
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,080
physics book, when someone
writes this, it's the exact

169
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,350
same thing as this or this.

170
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:18,170
The da could either be dx times
dy, or it could either be dy

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,420
times dx, and when they do this
double integral over domain,

172
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,380
that's the same thing is just
adding up all of these squares.

173
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,550
Where we do it here, we're
very ordered about it, right?

174
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,580
We go in the x-direction, and
then we add all of those up in

175
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,350
the y-direction, and we
get the entire volume.

176
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,020
Or we could go the
other way around.

177
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,580
When we say that we're just
taking the double integral,

178
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,950
first of all, that tells us
we're doing it in two

179
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,710
dimensions, over a domain,
that leaves it a little bit

180
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,790
ambiguous in terms of
how we're going to sum

181
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,430
up all of the da's.

182
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,990
And they do it intentionally in
physics books, because you

183
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,750
don't have to do it using
Cartesian coordinates,

184
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,720
using x's and y's.

185
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,940
You can do it in polar
coordinates, you could do it

186
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,260
a ton of different ways.

187
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,200
But I just wanted to show
you, this is another way to

188
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,870
having an intuition of the
volume under a surface.

189
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,620
And these are the exact same
things as this type of

190
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,840
notation that you might
see in a physics book.

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,420
Sometimes they won't write
a domain, sometimes they'd

192
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,250
write over a surface.

193
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,430
And we'll later do
those integrals.

194
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,080
Here the surface is easy, it's
a flat plane, but sometimes

195
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,380
it'll end up being a curve
or something like that.

196
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,790
But anyway, I'm
almost out of time.

197
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,390
I will see you in
the next video.

198
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,500
