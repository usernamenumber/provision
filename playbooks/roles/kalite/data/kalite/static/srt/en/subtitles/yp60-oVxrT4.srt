1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,722
We now know what an oxidation state or and oxidation number is and what it means when things are oxidized

2
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:13,107
or reduced and lets see how that actually happens in reactions so what we're going to study is this video

3
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:23,305
is oxidation/reduction reactions and all that is a reaction where somebody is being oxidized, which means

4
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:27,237
electroons are being taken away from them, and someone's being reduced, which means they are being handed

5
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:35,178
electrons or they are taking electrons away from someone else, and sometimes this has been termed, because

6
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:41,912
you have the red in reduction and you have the ox in oxidation an they switch them around and they call i

7
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:49,607
it a redox reaction, and it sounds like a very fancy chemistry term but it just means a reaction where

8
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:58,002
something is getting oxidized and if something is getting oxidized, something else is getting reduced,

9
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,477
so lets study a bunch of them. So right here I actually have combustion, this is actually methane, and

10
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:08,396
you know, methane is a fuel because it used to make a moter powered on methane, right there, its a hydrocarbon,

11
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:14,387
most fuels that we use are hydrocarbons, most fuels that we use are hydrocarbons which just means carbons ,

12
00:01:14,402 --> 00:01:20,576
bonded in a bunch of different ways to hydrogens and if you add enough heat for the reaction to happen,

13
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:23,868
so its activation energy if we put it in there with some oxygen around, its going to combust, its going

14
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:30,009
to produce carbon dioxide and water, and i didnt put it here, and even more heat than ou put into it

15
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,622
so this is an endothermic reaction, it produces more heat than you put into it and ill do a lot more

16
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:36,711
on that in future videos, about endothermic and exothermic reactions, but anyway, we care about the oxidation

17
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:42,943
and the reduction, so lets see if anyone is getting oxidized or anyone is getting reduced here, so, lets

18
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:52,083
look at their oxidation numbers, or their states, here carbon is bonded to four hydrogens, who's giving,

19
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:59,270
who's taking? the carbon, lets go to our periodic table, carbon is here, hydrogen is here, carbon is

20
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:06,359
more electronecative, its kind of, its adjacent to the three musketeers of electronegativity, these guys

21
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:13,259
are the most electronegative, we always ignore the halogens, not the halogens sorry, the noble gasses

22
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:17,718
because they pretty much dont react at all, they are pretty much happy with their 8 valence electrons,

23
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:23,801
these guys love to gain electrons, they're small molecules, their outermost shell is close to the nucleus

24
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:31,975
and they're so close to becoming noble they just love hogging electrons. carbon's almost there, carbon

25
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:38,383
is much further right on the periodic table than hydrogen, so if you have carbon bonding with hydrogen,

26
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:45,640
carbon is going to be the electron hog of this situation, lets go down here, so if carbon is the electron

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,151
hog, and hydrogen is having its electrond taken away from it, remember this is all kind of hypothetical,

28
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:59,885
its more partial is the reality, but if you had to pick or choose, hydrogen is going to lose an electron

29
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:06,154
each, so its going to have an oxidation state of plus one for hydrogen, you have four hydrogens each

30
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:14,938
giving up an electron, so the carbon must be taking four electrons, so it's oxidation number is minus

31
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:22,548
4, its taken 4 electrons so its charge will go down by 4, so that's why its negative, fair enough, now

32
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:27,397
whats the oxidation state of this oxygen right there, well its just bonded to itself, there's no reason

33
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:34,362
to believe that one oxygen should be able to take any electrons from another oxygen, so it has a zero

34
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:41,498
oxidation state, its not hogging more than its fair share of electrons that it was initially kind of

35
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:49,715
born with, now after the combustion occurs, what are the oxidation numbers, well I have oxygen bonded

36
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:57,470
with carbon, two oxygens bonded with carbon, now we know oxygen, i mean oxidation was something named

37
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,707
after oxygen, it is one of the most electronegative, almost anything bonded with oxygen is going to be

38
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:08,245
giving up its electrons, we also know that oxygen likes to take two electrons because if it takes one,

39
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:14,014
two electrons, then it starts having a, it takes one it gets here, it takes two it gets here, it has

40
00:04:14,014 --> 00:04:22,562
8 valence electrons, so it's typical oxidation number is negative two, so, carbon, in this situation,

41
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:32,380
each oxygen is going to have a minus two oxidation number, each carbon dioxide molecule is neutral, so

42
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,595
everything has to add up to zero, so the oxygens, you have two of them, each one of them with a minus

43
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:46,524
two for a total of minus four, so carbon must be plus four, plus four, which means that it has given

44
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:55,447
up four electrons, right, and really it only has four electrons to give up, it has one, two, three, four

45
00:04:55,462 --> 00:05:02,208
valence electrons, in its second shell, which is its reactive shell, so its oxidation number is plus

46
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:08,291
four. Now lets look at the water, we've done that a bunch, where the hydrogens each give up and electron

47
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:15,076
and they have and oxidation number of one, each oxygen takes two electrons, there is only one of them,

48
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:21,109
so its minus two, so whats going on here? Whats getting oxidized and whats getting reduced? You have

49
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:27,192
the carbon, which went from an oxidation number of minus four to an oxidation number of plus four, so

50
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:33,648
let me just draw whats happening to the carbon, carbon goes from minus four which means its hogging four

51
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:44,422
electrons to a situtation where its having four electrons being hogged from it, its kind of giving away

52
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:51,202
four electrons, so somewhere in this process, this guy must have given away eight electrons, this is

53
00:05:51,202 --> 00:06:00,165
a difference of eight electrons, so plus eight electrons, so what's happened to carbon, carbon has been...,

54
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:07,084
has it been oxidized or has it been reduced, its charge had gone up, so it hasn't been reduced, another

55
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:14,793
way you could say electrons have been taken away from it so it has been oxidized, oxidized, carbon had

56
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:27,379
been oxidized, now lets look at the oxygen, oxygen, over here you have four oxygen molecules, I'll just

57
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:35,784
write four oxygen molecules, and they all have an oxidation state of zero, because from an oxidation

58
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:42,797
number point of view they are neutral, and on this side we have two, no we have four oxygen molecules,

59
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:52,038
and what's there oxidation state? They're all minus two, they're all minus two, so oxygen, each of these

60
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:59,422
oxygens must have gained an electron, actually, let me rewrite this reaction, let me erase a little bit

61
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:07,642
of it, so each of these, actually even better let me just move this over, much better, move that over

62
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:17,952
there you go, and move that over, now let me fill in that so asthetically its pleasing, there you go,

63
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:23,478
alright, so we have four oxygens witha zero oxidation state turning into four oxygens with a minus two

64
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:32,255
oxidation state, so each of those four oxigens took two electrons, there's four of them, so we must have

65
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:40,057
we must have gained eight electrons, so what happened to oxygen, its oxidation number went sown, or its

66
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:51,853
hypothetical charge went down, it was reduced, its charge was reduced, reduced, ocygen was reduced, what

67
00:07:51,853 --> 00:08:03,230
was it reduced by? It was reduced by the carbon. What was the carbon oxidized by? It was oxidized by

68
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:13,810
the oxygen. Which oxygen tends to do, it oxidizing things, what is the oxidizing agent, well its the

69
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:22,317
thing that did the oxidizing. So oxygen is the oxidizing agent. What is the reducing agent? What is the

70
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:29,423
thing that did the reducing? It is the reducing agent, this is the carbon. you see in this redox reaction,

71
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:35,785
carbon was oxidized was oxidized, it gave electrons from this state to that state, hypothetically, and

72
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:43,215
oxygen was reduced, its charge was reduced by a total of eight electrons but two for each oxygen and

73
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:48,649
so its oxidation number went down. Lets do a couple more, and each of these things i wrote, just to do

74
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,386
a side note, this is called a half reaction because here I'm writing just what happened to the carbon

75
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:58,958
, and here I'm just what happened to the oxygen. And I did ignore something, I did ignore the hydrogen,

76
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,509
and I encourage you to do something like this with the hydrogen, but you'll see the hydrogen was neither

77
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:10,940
oxidized or reduced, on both sides of this equation, all of the hydrogens had a plus one oxidation state.

78
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,497
Let

79
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:17,302
Let's do another one, this is another combustion situation, this is what happened to the hindenburg,

80
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:23,246
they filled a balloon with hydrogen because they wanted it to float because hydrogen is a very light

81
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:29,377
gas, unfortunately there must have been a spark, and in the presence of oxygen, and it combusted. and

82
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:34,996
actually, this is for rocket fuel as well, if you have liquid hydrogen and, actually i don't think they

83
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,875
have liquid hydrogen. Well, I don't know enough about rocket science, I'll have to do another video on

84
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:41,683
that in the future, but lets look at the oxxidation states, well lets look at the oxidation state of

85
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:46,559
hydrogen here in its elemental form, its zero, two hydrogens bonded to each other no reason why they

86
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,479
should hog or be hogged by another hydrogen, two oxygen molecules or atoms bonded to each other, once

87
00:09:53,479 --> 00:10:00,422
again zero oxidation state, once they combust and form water, what's their oxidation states? Weve done

88
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:07,759
this multiple times. This oxygen has a minus two oxidation state, each hydrogen has a plus one, so lets

89
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:16,350
write the half reactions. We have two hydrogens that are just happy as they are; neutral state. And they

90
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:24,106
end up with, being, no sorry, two H twos, they turn into two hydrogens, two hydrogen molecules cuz there's

91
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:35,252
actually four hydrogen atoms,with a plus one oxidation state, so they must have each given away one electron,

92
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:41,382
now hhow many total hydrogens are there? There are four. So we must have given away four electrons. Plus

93
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:49,276
four electrons, and this is the half reaction for hydrogen. Now lets do the same thing for our oxygen,

94
00:10:49,276 --> 00:10:59,122
we have some oxygen here, on the left hand side it has a neutral oxidation state, and then it ends up

95
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:05,205
with a , we end up with two oxygens on the write hand side, I can write it, I'll write it like this.Two

96
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:12,775
O each with a minus two oxidation state so eac of these oxygens must have gotten two electrons, so it

97
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:23,178
got two electrons each or it gained four electrons. So what was oxidized? Oxidized means electrons were

98
00:11:23,178 --> 00:11:33,116
taken away from you. the hydrogen was oxidized. This was oxidized, oxidized by oxygen. What was reduced?

99
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:44,261
The oxygen was reduced by the hydrogen, and if you actually add these two reactions up, if you make this

100
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:50,345
the left hand side of your equation and you make this your right hand sade of the equation, you can say

101
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:55,593
"Ok" Let's remove the electrons from both sides and you'll end up with your original reaction. What was,

102
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:59,447
and just to make sure our terminology is right, what's our oxidizing agent? It's the thing that did

103
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:05,856
the oxidizing, it's the oxygen. What's the reducing agent? It's the hydrogen. Ket's do one more. So here

104
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:13,008
I have iron, plus some Hydrochloric acid, let's say this is in an aqueous solution, and you end up with

105
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:18,673
iron (II) chloride plus some hydrogen. So let's do some oxidation numbers, and I'll do it fast this time.

106
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:25,268
iron is just by itself it's got a zero oxidation state. Hydrogen with chloride, chlorine's a halogen.

107
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:30,190
haloge, these guys love to take electrons-they love to take one electron, they typically have a minus

108
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:39,618
one oxidation state, so the chlorine is going to have minus one, the hydrogen is going to be plus one.

109
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:46,073
Add them together you get to a neutral compound, fair enough. now you go on this side, what is chlorine's

110
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:51,506
oxidation state? Well once again it always likes to take one electron. So this is minus one, but I have

111
00:12:51,506 --> 00:13:01,305
two chlorines here, this is a neutral compound so the iron oxidation state must be plus two. Plus two.

112
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:02,996
What about the hydrogen? Well now it

113
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:08,847
is jus in its elemental form, so it's going to be neutral and have a zero oxidation state. So what was

114
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:17,513
oxidized? Our iron, our iron went from neutral to being, to having two electrons taken away from it which

115
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:28,333
gave it a positive charge, so plus two electrons got taken away, so this was oxidized. This is oxidized.

116
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:39,850
What about the hydrogen? The hydrogen went from two hydrogens with a plus one oxidation state and essentially

117
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:47,791
they went to two hydrogens with a neutral state, so two electrons must have been added to the hydrogens.

118
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:54,339
two electrons were added, their charge was reduced, so they were reduced. And what were they reduced

119
00:13:54,339 --> 00:14:01,491
by? They were reduced by the iron. What was the iron oxidized by? It was oxidized by the hydrogen. What

120
00:14:01,491 --> 00:14:07,157
about the chlorine, the chlorine has a minus one oxidation number here, it has a minus one oxidation

121
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:13,333
number here, it was neutral relative to the redox reaction, anyway I think you get the point now, and

122
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:13,942
you can do this with a bunch of reactions, but this will give you a little more insight of actually whats

123
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:22,833
going on and who's gaining and who's losing electrons and in the future it will also help us think about

124
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:28,201
alot of the structures of molecules. Anyway, see you in the next video.
