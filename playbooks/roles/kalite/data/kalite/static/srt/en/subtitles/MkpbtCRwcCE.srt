1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:04,756
Let's see if we can write 59.2 percent

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,491
(59.2 %) as a decimal.

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:10,337
Well 59.2 percent –

4
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:14,417
this literally means 59.2 per cent –

5
00:00:14,417 --> 00:00:18,216
which literally means 59.2 per 100 –

6
00:00:18,216 --> 00:00:23,159
which literally means 59.2 per 100 –

7
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:28,570
which is the same thing as 59.2 ÷ 100.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,339
If we were to divide 59.2 by 100,

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,078
what would we get?

10
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:37,676
So this is the same thing is 59.2 ÷ 100.

11
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,757
So if we if we were to take 59.2 –

12
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,410
if we wanted to divide it by 10,

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,577
we would move the decimal

14
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,826
over to the left once.

15
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:46,077
We would get 5.92.

16
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:47,496
But we want to divide by 100.

17
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:48,603
So we move the decimal

18
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,077
over to the left again.

19
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:51,477
We're dividing by 10 once,

20
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:53,533
and then we're dividing by 10 again.

21
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:54,941
If you divide by 10 twice,

22
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:55,869
you're essentially dividing by 100.

23
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,159
So you move the decimal to the left twice,

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,669
and you get 0. 592.

25
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:02,906
And we'll just put a 0 out here

26
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,335
just to clarify things.

27
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:05,207
And we're done.

28
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,409
We've written 59.2% as a decimal.

29
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:11,320
We essentially just divided this by a hundred,

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,070
which is dividing by 10 twice,

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,540
moving the decimal once to the left,

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,150
and then moving it another time.

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,273
Or, since we're dividing by 100,

34
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,878
moving the decimal twice to the left.

35
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,716
And we get 0.592.
