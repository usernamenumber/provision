1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
   

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,280
I've drawn a bunch of titration
curves here.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,220
So let's see if we can review
everything we've learned to

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,830
kind of have a more holistic
understanding of interpreting

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,760
these things.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,340
So the first thing to look at
is which of these are the

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,790
titration of acids
versus bases?

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,740
And everything I've done now
is acids, but the logic for

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,700
base titration is the exact
same thing as acid.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,360
So for example, these
are acid titrations.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,970
We start with low pH's.

12
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,290
In all of these, this
axis is pH.

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,820
I should have drawn that ahead
of time before I asked you the

14
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,100
question, but I think you
knew that already.

15
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,320
So before we add any of the
titrator or the reagent, in

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,490
this reaction, we're starting
with a low pH.

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,940
So this is kind of our
starting point.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,310
So we have a low pH there.

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,610
We have a low pH there.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,740
So these are both
clearly acids.

21
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,670
Here, our starting point before
we start titrating at

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,680
all, it's a high pH.

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,580
So both of these are bases.

24
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,830
Let me write that down.

25
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,070
   

26
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,080
These are clearly both bases.

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,870
Base titration, and this
is an acid titration.

28
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,510
   

29
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,700
Now, we haven't covered bases.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,820
But it's the same exact idea.

31
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,380
In an acid titration, you start
with an acid and you add

32
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,030
a strong base to it to sop up
all of the acid until all of

33
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,110
the acid is sopped up and you
hit the equivalence point.

34
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,630
You hit the point that all
of the acid is sopped up.

35
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,220
And now, as you add more and
more strong base, you're

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,970
making it superbasic.

37
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,400
So in this acid,
our equivalence

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,700
point is over here.

39
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,170
And in this acid,
our equivalence

40
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,570
point is over here.

41
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,570
This is how much solution
we had to add to sop

42
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,870
up all of the acid.

43
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,630
Right there.

44
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,060
So given what we already know,
which one's a strong acid,

45
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,560
which one's a weak acid?

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,530
Well, this one, when sopped up
all of the acid, we have a

47
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,090
completely neutral solution.

48
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,010
So this must have been
a strong acid.

49
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,900
There's nothing left.

50
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,090
Everything has been converted to
water in its natural state.

51
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,860
pH of 7.

52
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,620
And we might have had some
neutral leftover conjugate

53
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,440
bases there.

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,780
But since it was a strong acid,
those conjugate bases

55
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,760
don't do anything.

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,780
They don't add anything
to the pH.

57
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,389
They're not really basic.

58
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,440
The chlorine in hydrogen
chloride, the chlorine ion,

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,050
doesn't change the pH.

60
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,890
So this is a strong acid.

61
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,210
And this one, when we got to the
equivalence point-- when

62
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,840
we had used up all of the acid
in a solution, and then we hit

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,780
this in inflection point, where
any OH we added was

64
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,070
significantly increasing the
pH-- when we hit that

65
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,750
equivalence point, our
pH was already basic.

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,030
And that's because we had all
of the conjugate base of the

67
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,480
weak acid, which does make
the solution more basic.

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,380
So this is a weak acid.

69
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,590
And in both of these situations,
we were increasing

70
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,420
the concentration of OH minus.

71
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,480
Maybe by adding sodium hydroxide
to the solution, a

72
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,750
strong base.

73
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,680
Now, In these situations, we
start with a base, and we add

74
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,500
a strong acid to it.

75
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,540
Maybe whatever base.

76
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,800
We're adding hydrogen chloride,
something that will

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
sop up the OH.

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,210
Here, we want to sop up the OH
and bring its concentration

79
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,800
down, until some point that we
have sopped up all of the OH.

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
All of the base is gone.

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,350
Or most of it is gone.

82
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,530
In this situation, we're in a
completely neutral situation.

83
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,940
So when we sopped up
all of the base,

84
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,340
we're completely neutral.

85
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,500
No basic conjugate bases left.

86
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,720
So this is a strong base.

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,430
   

88
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,420
And here, the titration, we're
increasing the hydrogen

89
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,480
solution, or the hydrogen
concentration, to

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,950
sop up all the base.

91
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,790
Same thing here.

92
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,000
We're sopping up all
of the base.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
We start over here.

94
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,590
But over here, the inflection
point happens right over here.

95
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,530
So we've sopped up all of its
base, but some of its

96
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,640
conjugate acid is still left
over, even after we've sopped

97
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,220
up all of its base.

98
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,810
So we end up with a slightly
negative pH at

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,750
the equivalence point.

100
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,600
So this is a weak base.

101
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,470
Let me actually draw that
reaction for you.

102
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,230
Remember, a weak base looks
something like this.

103
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,390
Maybe its A minus is in
equilibrium-- that second

104
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,500
equilibrium arrow is a little
too wild for my blood-- is

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,610
equilibrium with AH.

106
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,140
It grabs hydrogen ions from
the surrounding water.

107
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,040
Everything is in an
aqueous solution.

108
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,190
So after you add hydrochloric
acid to this-- remember, HcL

109
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,080
disassociates completely
into hydrogen ions

110
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,440
plus chlorine anions.

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,370
If you add hydrochloric acid
to this, these things are

112
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,300
going to just completely
sop up these things.

113
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,240
So we keep sopping
up those things.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,840
Our concentration of OH goes
down and down and down.

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,000
And as we sop up this, our
reaction goes in that

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,560
direction because Le Chatelier's
Principle.

117
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,030
More and more of this is
going to get formed

118
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,490
into this and that.

119
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,950
Until some point, we're out
of that, and we have

120
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,510
a ton of this left.

121
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,950
And so our equivalent point is
when we're out of this stuff.

122
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,770
And when we're adding more
hydrogens, we're getting

123
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,080
really acidic really fast. But
we have a lot of the conjugate

124
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,130
acid there in the solution
already.

125
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,330
So we're going to have an acidic
equivalence point.

126
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,460
Now, let me give you an actual
problem, just to hit all the

127
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,040
points home.

128
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Because everything I've done now
has been very hand-wavey,

129
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,500
and no numbers.

130
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,510
So let me draw one.

131
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,310
Let me draw a weak acid.

132
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,170
And you'll recognize
it because you're

133
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,920
good at this now.

134
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,620
But I'll deal with some
real numbers here.

135
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,810
So let's say that's a pH of 7.

136
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,580
We're going to titrate it.

137
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,130
It starts off at a low pH
because it's a weak acid.

138
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,320
And as we titrate it,
it's pH goes up.

139
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,995
And then it hits the equivalence
point and

140
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,470
it goes like that.

141
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,730
The equivalence point
is right over here.

142
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,460
And let's say our reagent
that we were

143
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,520
adding is sodium hydroxide.

144
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,130
And let's say it's a
0.2 molar solution.

145
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,340
   

146
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,630
I've been using too
round numbers.

147
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,870
I'll use 700 milliliters of
sodium hydroxide is our

148
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,250
equivalence point.

149
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,250
Right there.

150
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,550
So the first question
is how much of our

151
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,220
weak acid did we have?

152
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,300
So what was our original

153
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,670
concentration of our weak acid?

154
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,660
This is just a general
placeholder for the acid.

155
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,930
So original concentration
of our weak acid.

156
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,150
Well, we must have added enough
moles of OH at the

157
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,600
equivalent point to cancel out
all of the moles of the weak

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,020
acid in whatever hydrogen
was out there.

159
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,490
But the main concentration
was from the weak acid.

160
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,780
This 700 milliliters of our
reagent must have the same

161
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,920
number of moles as the number
of moles of weak acid we

162
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,610
started off with.

163
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,990
And let's say our solution at
the beginning was 3 liters.

164
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,860
3 liters to begin with, before
we started titrating.

165
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,490
Obviously, as we add reagent,
we're adding some volume to

166
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,000
the solution.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,580
But let's just say that
in the beginning, we

168
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,470
started with 3 liters.

169
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,990
So how many moles have
we sopped up?

170
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,505
Well, how many moles of OH are
there in 700 milliliters of

171
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,200
our solution?

172
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:32,170
Well, we know that we have 0.2
moles per liter of OH.

173
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,450
And then we know that
we don't have--

174
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:39,020
times 0.7 liters, right?

175
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,620
700 milliliters is 0.7 liters.

176
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,540
So how many moles have we
added to the situation?

177
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:43,780
Let's see.

178
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,570
2 times 7 is 14.

179
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,060
And we have 2 numbers
behind the decimal.

180
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,660
So it's 0.14.

181
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,470
So 700 milliliters of 0.2 molar
sodium hydroxide, and we

182
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,710
have 700 milliliters of
it, or 0.7 liters.

183
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,950
We're going to have 0.14 moles
of, essentially, OH that we

184
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,850
put into the solution, which
means that it canceled out

185
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,770
completely with the same
number of moles of our

186
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,060
original acid.

187
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,620
So that means that the original
concentration of our

188
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,200
acid is equal to 0.14 moles.

189
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,110
That's how many moles we had.

190
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,490
And we know that our original
solution before we started

191
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,500
titrating at all, is 3 liters.

192
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,049
Remember, the molecules
are canceling

193
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,250
directly with each other.

194
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,750
So that's why I wanted to figure
out how many actual

195
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,530
atoms, or molecules,
of OH did I add.

196
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,910
Those canceled out with the
exact same number of atoms of

197
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,930
out weak acid.

198
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,130
And so this is how many atoms or
molecules of our weak acid

199
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,690
we must have started off with.

200
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,240
And so you divide that by the
number of liters, and then you

201
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,940
have your original molarity.

202
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,070
So 0.14 divided by 3.

203
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,270
0.046.

204
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,840
So you're initial concentration
of the mystery

205
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,370
acid was 0.046 molar.

206
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,550
Fair enough.

207
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,960
Now, the other question
is, what is the pKa

208
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,210
of our mystery acid?

209
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,980
   

210
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,290
Well, we just go to the half
equivalence point.

211
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,740
So we said, OK.

212
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,830
What was the pH of
our titration

213
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,970
curve or of our solution?

214
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,300
We were at the half
equivalence point.

215
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:46,260
So when we had only added 350
milliliters of our reagent, of

216
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,310
our strong base, to
the solution.

217
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,670
So you go there, and you
say OK, the pH was 5.

218
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,410
pH is equal to 5.

219
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,470
And we know, from the last
video, that if you take this

220
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,440
half equivalence point, the pH
is equal to the pKa, the

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,080
negative log of our equilibrium
constant.

222
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,800
So there.

223
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,590
We figured out the equilibrium
constant as well.

224
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,970
It's equal to 5.

225
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,430
So all of this titration curve
and all of this, I'm just

226
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,460
showing you how experimentally,
you can take

227
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,340
some mystery acid or base.

228
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,600
You add strong acid
or base to it.

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,770
You plot out this curve.

230
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,620
And then you can pinpoint some
of the properties, the

231
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,150
concentration of your original
acid or base.

232
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,550
And only if you're dealing with
a weak acid or base, you

233
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,410
can figure out it's equilibrium
constant.

234
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,900
Obviously, if you take a strong
acid, you say, oh, my

235
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,210
half equivalence
point is here.

236
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,530
So therefore, this must be the
equilibrium or the pKa-- No.

237
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,610
There is no equilibrium constant
for a strong acid.

238
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,290
And there is no equilibrium
constant for a strong base,

239
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,180
because they're not
in equilibrium.

240
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,910
They disassociate completely.

241
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,460
Anyway, hopefully you have
a good understanding of

242
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,250
titration now.

243
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:01,665
