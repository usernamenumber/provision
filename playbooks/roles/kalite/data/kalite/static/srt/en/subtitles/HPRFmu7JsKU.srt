1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
   

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,040
In the last video, I told you
that if I had a hyperbola with

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:11,080
the equation x squared over a
squared minus y squared over b

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,500
squared is equal to 1, that the
focal distance for this

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,750
hyperbola is just equal to the
square root of the sum

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,995
of these two numbers.

7
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:22,510
The square root of a
squared plus b squared.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,910
In this video I really just
want to show you that.

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,290
And actually, just so you know,
this equation right here, this

10
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,090
is a particular hyperbola that
opens to the left

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,650
and the right.

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,900
And that's because those
are the asymptote points.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,970
Those would be the axis.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,350
And that's because the
x term is positive.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,690
If the y term was positive and
the x term had a negative sign,

16
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,210
then the hyperbola would open
upwards and downwards,

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,470
like that.

18
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,890
And the proof that I'm showing
you in this video, it's just a

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,110
bunch of algebra, really, is
identical in the y case, you'd

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,710
just switch around
x's and the y's.

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,130
But I just wanted to make
sure you realize that.

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,050
That I'm just doing a
particular case of hyperbola

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,370
that opens the left
and the right.

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,830
I could call it a horizontal
hyperbola, instead of a

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,840
vertical one, but I wanted
to make it clear there is

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,730
another type of hyperbola.

27
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,790
But anyway, let's draw a
graphical representation of all

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,530
this just to make sure
we understand, or we

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,640
re-understand, or better
understand what the foci points

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,570
are and where they sit on the
hyperbola So those are my axis.

31
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,910
The asymptotes of this
hyperbola are the lines

32
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,090
y is equal to plus
or minus b over a.

33
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,830
Oh woops, not using
my line tool.

34
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:34,530
So, that's one and that's
the other asymptote.

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,410
then the hyperbola will
look something like this.

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,670
It looks something like that.

37
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,940
It's going to intersect at
a comma 0, right there.

38
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,700
This is going to be a comma 0.

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,140
And the intersect at
minus a comma 0.

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,460
We saw this in the
previous video.

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,080
It looks something like that.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,370
And then the focus
points are going to sit

43
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,070
out here someplace.

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,980
There and there.

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,090
And the focal length this
a squared plus b square.

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,940
The square root of a
squared plus b squared.

47
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,690
That's just this
distance right here.

48
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,000
That distance is
the focal length.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
So this is going to be the
point f,0 and this is going

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,330
to be the point minus f,0.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,510
Now we learned in the last
video that one of the

52
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,070
definitions of a hyperbola is
the locus of all points, or the

53
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,940
set of all points, where if I
take the difference of the

54
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,700
distances to the two foci, that
difference will be

55
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,340
a constant number.

56
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,620
So if this is the point x comma
y, and it could be any point

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,730
that satisfies this equation,
it's any point on the

58
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,840
byperbola, we know, or we are
told, that if we take this

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,120
distance right here-- --let's
call that d1 --and subtract

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,370
from that the distance to the
high other foci-- call that d2

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,190
--that that number is a
constant regardless of where we

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,950
are on the hyperbola.

63
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,530
In fact the locus of all points
are-- the hyperbole in fact

64
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,820
is all of the points that
satisfy that condition.

65
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,500
And we learned in last video
just by taking the difference

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,390
of the distance, we picked this
point and we said, OK, what's

67
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,070
that distance minus
that distance.

68
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,070
And we figured out
that it's 2a.

69
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,570
So d1 minus d2 is equal to--
I'm going off the video screen

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,800
--d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,130
So let's use this fact right
here that d1 minus d2 is equal

72
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,190
to 2a, to try to prove this.

73
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,160
Right there.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,890
So the first thing to do is
figure out what d1 and d2.

75
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,140
Just using the
distance formula.

76
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,930
So what's d1?

77
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,670
d1 is the distance between this
point and this point minus f0.

78
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,280
So what you do is we just
use the distance formula,

79
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,980
which is really just
Pythagorean theorem.

80
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,840
So it's the difference
of the x's.

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,850
It's the x distance.

82
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:01,890
So it's x minus f squared
plus the y distances.

83
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,010
y minus 0, so that's
just y, squared.

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,290
Take the square root of that.

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,530
So that's d1, right there.

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,140
d1.

87
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,570
And we want to subtract
from that d2.

88
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,090
the difference of the
distances, and in this case d1

89
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,770
is definitely bigger than d2.

90
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,540
Or you could take the absolute
values if you didn't want

91
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,870
to worry about that.

92
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,740
And so here, we get the square
root of x minus f, x minus

93
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,720
f squared, plus y squared.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,790
What does that equal to?

95
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,570
Well, we said that equals
to 2a, that equals this

96
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,350
distance right here.

97
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,255
So that is equal to 2a.

98
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:47,180
Now let's see if we can
simplify this at all.

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,430
Well an interesting thing to do
my just to be the put this on

100
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,350
the other side of the equation.

101
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,120
And this just can get hairy,
so I really hope I don't

102
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,230
make any careless mistakes.

103
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,850
So this becomes-- and I might
write small to save space

104
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,220
--this becomes x plus f, right,
minus minus, squared plus y

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:15,810
squared is equal to 2a plus the
square root of x minus f

106
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,180
squared plus y squared.

107
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,240
Now, to get rid of these
radicals, let's square both

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,740
sides of this equation.

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,990
The left hand side, if you were
to square it just becomes x

110
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,980
plus f squared plus y squared.

111
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,970
And then to square this we have
to square the first term,

112
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,140
which is 4a squared.

113
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,630
Then we multiply the two terms
and multiply that by 2, right?

114
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,530
We're just taking this whole
thing and squaring it, so

115
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,370
that's-- and this is just a
review of kind of binomial

116
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,960
algebra --so this is equal to
plus 2a times this times 2 is

117
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:01,980
4a times the square root of
x minus f squared plus y.

118
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,430
y squared, I don't want to lose
that squared right there.

119
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,780
And then we square this term.

120
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,870
And this is just
multiplying a binomial.

121
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,300
So that's equal to-- you just
get rid of the radical sign,

122
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,760
and I'm just going to be
staying in that color for now

123
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,270
--that's equal to x minus
f squared plus y squared.

124
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,670
And already it looks like
there's some cancellation

125
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,220
that we can do.

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,430
We can cancel out-- there's a
y squared on both sides of

127
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,270
this equation --so let's
just cancel those out.

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,940
Subtract y squared from both
sides of the equation.

129
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,070
And let's multiply
this term out.

130
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:42,840
So this right here is x squared
plus 2xf plus f squared.

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,940
And then that is equal to 4a
squared plus 4a times the

132
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:58,896
square root of x minus f
squared plus y squared.

133
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,750
And then multiply this out.

134
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:07,230
Plus x squared minus
2xf plus f squared.

135
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,860
And then let's see, what
can we cancel out.

136
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,150
We have x squared on both
sides of this, we subtract

137
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,400
x squared from both
sides of the equation.

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,460
We have an f squared on both
sides of the equation so

139
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,760
let's cancel that out.

140
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,430
And let's see, what can
we do to simplify it.

141
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,330
So we have a minus
2xf and a plus 2xf.

142
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,080
Let's add 2xf to both sides
this equation or bring

143
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,670
this term over here.

144
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,610
So if you add 2xf to both sides
of this equation-- let's see,

145
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,180
my phone is ringing, let me
just turn it off --if you add

146
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,780
2xf to both sides of this
equation, what do you get?

147
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,010
You get 4xf-- remember I just
brought this term over this

148
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:52,710
left hand side --is equal to
4a squared plus 4a times a

149
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:58,120
square root of x minus f
squared plus y squared.

150
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,270
It's easy to get lost
in the algebra.

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,690
Remember all we're doing, just
to kind of remind you of what

152
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,410
this whole point was, we're
just simplifying the difference

153
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,290
of the distances between these
two points, and then see how

154
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,840
it relates to the equation
of the hyperbola itself.

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,570
The a's and the b's.

156
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:19,980
Let's take this 4a put it on
this side, so you get 4xf minus

157
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:27,820
4a squared is equal to 4a times
the square root of-- well let's

158
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,950
just multiply this out 'cause
we'll probably have to

159
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:36,470
eventually --x squared minus
2xf plus f squared

160
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,500
plus y squared.

161
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,990
That's this just
multiplied out.

162
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,000
That's the y squared
right there.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,160
We could divide both
sides of this by 4.

164
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,390
All I'm trying to do is just
simplify this as much as

165
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:54,180
possible, so then this becomes
xf minus a squared is equal to

166
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,450
a times the square root
of this whole thing.

167
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:05,970
x squared minus 2xf plus f
squared plus why squared.

168
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,140
And now we could square
both sides of this

169
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,440
equation right here.

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,060
And then if you square both
sides, this side becomes x

171
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:26,900
squared f squared minus 2a
squared xf plus a

172
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,020
to the fourth.

173
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,610
That's this side squared.

174
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,600
And that's equal to, if you
square the right hand side, a

175
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,490
squared times the square of
a square root is just that

176
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:46,180
expression, x squared minus 2xf
plus f squared plus y squared.

177
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,470
This really is quite hairy.

178
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,350
And let's see what
we can do now.

179
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,340
Let's divide both sides of this
equation by a squared, and then

180
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,150
you get x squared-- I'm really
just trying to simplify this as

181
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,000
much as possible --over a
squared minus-- so the a

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,500
squareds cancel out --minus 2xf
plus a to the fourth divided a

183
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,470
square well that's
just a squared.

184
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:19,840
So a squared is equal to x
squared minus 2xf plus f

185
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,900
squared plus y squared.

186
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,410
Well good.

187
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,360
There's something
to cancel out.

188
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,280
There's a mine 2xf on both
sides of this equation so

189
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,870
let's cancel that out.

190
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,530
Simplify our situation
a little bit.

191
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,210
And let's see, we have.

192
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,580
so we could do is subtract
this x squared from this.

193
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,300
So you get-- let me rewrite
it --so you get x squared

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,100
f squared over a squared
minus x squared.

195
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,330
And let's bring this y to this
side of the equation too.

196
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,240
So minus y squared.

197
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,900
That's all I did, I just
brought that to that side.

198
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,540
And then let's bring-- and I'm
kind of skipping a couple of

199
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,310
steps, but I don't want to take
too long --let's take this a

200
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,580
and put it on that
side equation.

201
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,430
So we took the x and the y,
we subtracted that from

202
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,220
both sides of the equation.

203
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,040
So they ended up on
the left hand side.

204
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,600
And then if we subtract a
squared from both sides of this

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,510
equation-- this is a fatiguing
problem --then you get f

206
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,850
squared minus a squared.

207
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,370
I think we're almost there.

208
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,970
This can simplify to,
let's see we can factor

209
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,340
out the x squared.

210
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,640
This becomes f squared
over a squared minus

211
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,790
1 times x squared.

212
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,420
I just factor out the x squared
there, minus y squared is equal

213
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,750
to f squared, the focal length
squared, minus a squared.

214
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,310
And let's see, let's divide
both sides of the equation by

215
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,230
this expression right there,
and we get-- and this should

216
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:00,490
start to look familiar --we get
f squared over a squared minus

217
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:09,770
1, x squared divided by f
squared minus a squared minus y

218
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,450
squared over f squared mine
is a squared is equal 1.

219
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,880
Right, I divided both sides
by this, so I just get a 1

220
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,910
on this right hand side.

221
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,930
Let's see if I can
simplify this.

222
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,790
If I multiply the numerator
and the denominator

223
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,850
by a squared, right?

224
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,420
As long as I multiply the
numerator and the denominator

225
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,430
by the same number I'm just
multiplying my 1, so I'm

226
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,870
not changing anything.

227
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,200
So if I do that, the numerator
becomes f-- if I multiply it,

228
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,880
it becomes f squared
minus a squared.

229
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm just multiplying
that times a squared.

230
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,750
And the denominator
becomes a squared times f

231
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,240
squared minus a squared.

232
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,680
And all that times x squared.

233
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,100
Minus y squared minus
a squared mine is a

234
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,160
squared is equal to 1.

235
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,450
This cancels with this.

236
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,630
And we get something to
starting to look like the

237
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,180
equation of a hyperbola.

238
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,080
My energy is coming back!

239
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,510
It seems like I see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

240
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:14,550
We get x squared over a squared
minus y squared over f minus

241
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,260
a squared is equal to 1.

242
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,820
Now this looks a lot like our
original equation of the

243
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,940
hyperbola, which was x squared
over a squared minus y squared

244
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,630
over b squared is equal to 1.

245
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,790
In fact this is equation of the
hyperbola but instead set of

246
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,580
writing b squared, since we
wrote it, we essentially said,

247
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,030
what is the locus of all points
where the difference of the

248
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,410
distances to those two
foci is equal to 2a?

249
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,010
And we just played with
the algebra for while.

250
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,410
It was pretty tiring, and I'm
impressed if you've gotten this

251
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,860
far into the video, and we got
this equation, which should be

252
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,890
the equation of the hyperbola,
and it is the equation

253
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,520
of the hyperbole.

254
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,110
It is this equation.

255
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,690
So this is the same
thing is that.

256
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,390
So f squared minus a square.

257
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,460
Or the focal length squared
minus a squared is

258
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,830
equal to b squared.

259
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,170
You add a squared to both
sides, and you get f squared

260
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,740
is equal to b squared plus
a squared or a squared

261
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,190
plus b squared.

262
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,310
Which tells us that the focal
length is equal to the

263
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,960
square root of this.

264
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,440
Of a squared plus b squared.

265
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
And that's what we set out to
figure out in the beginning.

266
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,020
So hopefully you're now
satisfied that the focal length

267
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,480
of a hyperbola is the sum of
these two denominators.

268
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,940
And it's also truth if it is an
upward or vertical hyperbola.

269
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,220
And if we're dealing with an
ellipse, it's the difference of

270
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,590
these two-- the square root
of the difference of

271
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,730
these two numbers.

272
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,240
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

273
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,630
That was an exhausting problem.

274
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,210
I have to go get a
glass of water now.

275
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,156
