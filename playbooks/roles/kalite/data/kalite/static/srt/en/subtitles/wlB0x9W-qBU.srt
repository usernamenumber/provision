1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:03,267
What I want to do with this video

2
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:06,267
is think about what happens to some type of projectile,

3
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:09,800
maybe a ball or rock, if I were to throw it

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,400
straight up into the air.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,600
To do that I want to plot distance relative to time.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,800
There are a few things I am going to tell you about

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,400
my throwing the rock into the air.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,667
The rock will have an initial velocity (Vi) of 19.6 meters per second (19.6m/s)

9
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,667
I picked this initial velocity because

10
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,133
it will make the math a little bit easier.

11
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:38,667
We also know the acceleration near the surface of the earth.

12
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,267
We know the force of gravity

13
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:47,267
near the surface of the earth is the mass of the obeject times the acceleration.

14
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:48,467
(let me write this down)

15
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:54,800
The force of gravity is going to be the mass of the object times little g.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,733
little g is gravity near the surface of the earth

17
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,800
g is 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2)

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Now if you want the acceleration on earth

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,800
you just take the force divided by the mass

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,533
Because we have the general equation

21
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:15,067
Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma)

22
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:17,133
If you wan acceleration divide both sides by mass

23
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,200
so you get force over mass

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
So, lets just divide this by mass

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,800
If you divide both sides by mass,

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,733
on the left had side you will get acceleration

27
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:35,600
and on the right hand side you will get the quantity little g.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,267
The whole reason why I did this is

29
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,467
when we look at the g it really comes from

30
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,667
the universal law of gravitation.

31
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,800
You can really view g as

32
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,733
measuring the gravitational field strength near the surface of the earth.

33
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:54,200
Then that helps us figure out the force

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,667
when you multiply mass times g.

35
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,000
Then you use F=ma, the second law,

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,867
to come up with g again

37
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:02,933
which is actually the acceleration.

38
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,667
This is accelerating you towards the center of the earth.

39
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,333
The other thing I want to make clear:

40
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,533
when you talk about the Force of gravity

41
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:15,333
generally the force of gravity is equal to big G

42
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,533
Big G (which is different than little g) times

43
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,000
the product of the masses of the two things

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,067
over the square of the distance between the two things.

45
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,867
You might be saying "Wait, clearly the force of gravity is dependent on the distance.

46
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:33,867
So if I were to throw something up into the air,

47
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,533
won't the distance change."

48
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,400
And you would be right!

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,667
That is technically right, but

50
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,867
the reality is that when you

51
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,333
throw something up into the air

52
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,933
that change in distance is so small

53
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:45,933
relative to the distance between the object and the center of the earth

54
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,133
that to make the math simple,

55
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,873
When we are at or near the surface of the earth (including in our atmosphere)

56
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,000
we can assume that it is constant.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,557
Remember that little g over there is

58
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,343
all of these terms combined.

59
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,990
If we assume that mass one (m1) is

60
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,492
the mass of the earth, and

61
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:23,059
r is the radius of the earth (the distance from the center of the earth)

62
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,938
So you would be correct in thinking that it changes a little bit.

63
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:28,863
The force of gravity changes a little bit, but

64
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:31,139
for the sake of throwing things up into our atmosphere

65
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,436
we can assume that it is constant.

66
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:35,876
And if we were to calculate it

67
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:40,056
it is 9.8 meters per second squared

68
00:03:40,056 --> 00:03:42,238
and I have rounded here to the nearest tenth.

69
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,932
I want to be clear these are vector quantities.

70
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,904
When we start throwing things up into the air

71
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,251
the convention is

72
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:52,641
if something is moving up it is given a positive value,

73
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:57,331
and if it is moving down we give it a negative value.

74
00:03:57,331 --> 00:04:01,650
Well, for an object that is in free fall

75
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,833
gravity would be accelerating it downwards, or

76
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,226
the force of gravity is downwards.

77
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,501
So, little g over here,

78
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:08,755
if you want to give it its direction,

79
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:14,142
is negative. Little g is -9.8m/s2.

80
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:16,975
So, we have the acceleration due to gravity.

81
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,669
The acceleration due to gravity (ag) is

82
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:25,149
negative 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2).

83
00:04:25,149 --> 00:04:27,471
Now I want to plot distance relative to time.

84
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:32,300
Let's think about how we can set up a formula,

85
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,830
derive a formula that, if we input time as a variable,

86
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,827
we can get distance.

87
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,933
We can assume these values right over here.

88
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:46,093
Well actually I want to plot displacement over time because that will be more interesting.

89
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:50,667
We know that displacement is

90
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:59,933
the same thing as average velocity times change in time (displacement=Vavg*(t1-t2)).

91
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,200
Right now we have

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,926
something in terms of time, distance, and average velocity

93
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:07,595
but not in terms of initial velocity and acceleration.

94
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:12,842
We know that average velocity is the same thing as

95
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:17,626
initial velocity (vi) plus final velocity (vf) over 2. (Vavg=(vi+vf)/2)

96
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:20,273
If we assume constant acceleration.

97
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:26,333
We can only calculate Vavg this way assuming constant acceleration.

98
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,467
Once again when were are dealing

99
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,836
with objects not too far from the center of the earth

100
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:33,601
we can make that assumption.

101
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,759
Assuming that we have a constant acceleration

102
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,031
Once again we don't have what our final velocity is.

103
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,307
So, we need to think about this a little more.

104
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:48,090
We can express our final velocity in terms of our initial velocity and time.

105
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,733
Just dealing with this part, the average velocity.

106
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,067
So we can rewrite this expression

107
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,667
as the initial velocity plus something over 2.

108
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,267
and what is final velocity?

109
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:05,000
Well the final velocity is going to be

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,333
your initial velocity plus your acceleration times change in time.

111
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,000
If you are starting at 10m/s

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,667
and you are accelerated at 1m/s^2

113
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:24,267
then after 1 second you will be going 1 second faster than that. (11m/s)

114
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:29,267
So this right here is your final velocity.

115
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:35,200
Let me make sure that these are all vector quantities...(draws vector arrows)

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,933
All of these are vector quantities.

117
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:42,533
Hopefully it is ingrained in you that these are all vector quantities, direction matters.

118
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,467
And let's see how we can simplify this

119
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:47,467
Well these two terms

120
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,867
(remember we are just dealing with the average velocity here)

121
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,067
These two terms if you combine them become 2 times initial velocity (2vi).

122
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:57,133
two times my initial velocity

123
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,667
and then divided by this 2

124
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,200
plus all of this business divided by this 2.

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,200
which is my acceleration times my change in time divided by 2.

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
All of this was another way to write average velocity.

127
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
the whole reason why I did this is because we don't have final velocity

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,133
but we have acceleration

129
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,733
and we are going to use change in time as our independent variable.

130
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:25,133
We still have to multiply this by this green change in time here.

131
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:29,422
multiply all of this times the green change in time.

132
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:31,419
All of this is what displacement is going to be.

133
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,859
This is displacement, and lets see...

134
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,716
we can multiply the change in time times all this

135
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:37,733
actually these 2s cancel out

136
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:42,867
and we get (continued over here)

137
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:47,933
We get: displacement is equal to

138
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:52,467
initial velocity times

139
00:07:52,467 --> 00:08:01,533
change in time

140
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:07,400
Some physics classes or textbooks put time there but it is really change in time.

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,333
change in time is a little more accurate

142
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:19,800
plus 1/2 (which is the same as dividing by 2)

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,268
plus one half times the acceleration

144
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,240
times the acceleration

145
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,748
times (we have a delta t times delta t)

146
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:31,733
change in time times change in time

147
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:34,333
the triangle is delta and it just means "change in"

148
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,467
so change in time times change in time

149
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:41,133
is just change in times squared.

150
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,067
In some classes you will see this written as

151
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:51,333
d is equal to vi times t plus 1/2 a t squared

152
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,200
this is the same exact thing

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,733
they are just using d for displacement

154
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,200
and t in place of delta t.

155
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,800
The one thing I want you to realize with this video

156
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,533
is that this is a very straight forward thing to derive.

157
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:10,400
Maybe if you were under time pressure you would want to be able to whip this out,

158
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,491
but the important thing, so you remember how to do this when you are 30 or 40 or 50

159
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,256
or when you are an engineer and you are trying

160
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,367
to send a rocket into space and you don't have a physics book to look it up,

161
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:25,568
is that it comes from the simple displacement is equal to average velocity times change in time

162
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,844
and we assume constant acceleration,

163
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:31,234
and you can just derive the rest of this.

164
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:33,277
I am going to leave you there in this video.

165
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:37,667
Let me erase this part right over here.

166
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,243
We are going to leave it right over here.

167
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,751
In the next video we are going to use this

168
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,284
formula we just derived.

169
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,141
We are going to use this to actually

170
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,667
plot the displacement vs time

171
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,467
because that is interesting and we are going to be thinking about

172
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,867
what happens to the velocity and the acceleration

173
00:09:52,867 --> 99:59:59,999
as we move further and further in time.
