1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,510
In the last video we talked
about the situation where I'm

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,390
taking 6 shots on a goal.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,570
We knew my probability of
making any given shot, and what

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,510
we wanted to do is figure out
the probability distribution of

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,550
me making k shots, in general.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,410
We defined our random
variable, x, as the number

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,690
of shots I make out of 6.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,280
So I realized in that last
example and that example is

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,100
right back here, that the
math gets a little hairy.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,260
You're dealing with 0.7 then
times 0.3 to the fifth

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,000
and all of that.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,630
So it got a little complicated
and what better thing to do if

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,240
you have numbers like this,
even better than the

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,550
calculator than to use Excel.

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:40,330
And you'll see that Excel is
a fairly powerful tool for

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,430
probability and statistics.

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,620
And in general, for a lot
of types of simulations.

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,130
If you don't want to actually
write serious code you can

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,770
actually do fairly serious
things with something as

20
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,400
seemingly not so simple, or
not so serious as Excel.

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
But it's actually
quite serious.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,370
So let's see.

23
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,280
So let's say that I'm going
to take-- let's define n.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm going to say that that is,
I'm going to take 6 shots.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,150
The probability of me making
any shot I'll say is 0.3.

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,440
That's what we did
in the last video.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,450
The probability of a miss,
let me actually write it a

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,310
little bit more explicitly.

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,990
Probability of a make is equal
to 0.3 and the probability of a

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,640
miss I'm going to write-- and
instead of just writing 0.7

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,110
there because we know it is,
let's just it a little bit

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,070
dependent on the first one.

33
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,080
So write out the formula, we'll
say that's equal to 1 minus--

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,510
and then we'll select
this cell right here.

35
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,880
It's equal to 1 minus the
probability that I make a

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,950
shot, And notice it just
calculated it for us, 0.7.

37
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,570
Let me zoom in a little bit.

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,060
There you go.

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,950
That might be easier
for you to read.

40
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,140
Because I know it gets
really small on YouTube.

41
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,830
And this is neat because now if
we wanted to see what happens

42
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,490
when this becomes 0.2
that automatically

43
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,510
calculates to 0.8.

44
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,900
So that's neat.

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,870
Let's just put it back to 0.3.

46
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,440
And now let's do a bunch of
rows so that we can calculate

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,500
the probability that our random
variable, x, could be 0

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,870
shots or 1 shot or whatever.

49
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,860
So let's say that k-- let
me make a row called k.

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,590
So that's the number of
shots we need to make.

51
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,995
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

52
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:20,260
You can't see the sixth one
right now, let me just go

53
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,650
up here and now you
can see everything.

54
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,430
And then we need to figure out
the binomial coefficient.

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,210
Well actually,
let's do it first.

56
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,780
Let's say the probability of
making any one of those,

57
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,170
any one way of getting no
shots, or any one way of

58
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,170
getting exactly 3 shots.

59
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,210
So that's going to be the
probability of a make.

60
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,530
So you're going to make it.

61
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,530
You're going to make k shots
times the probability

62
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,980
of a miss.

63
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,820
So if you make k shots,
how many do you miss?

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,100
You miss n minus k.

65
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,990
And I'm not doing anything
fancy in Excel right here.

66
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,210
I'm just kind of writing a
label that hopefully is a

67
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,190
little intuitive for you.

68
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,880
So this is the probability--
this column is going to be-- in

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,070
this cell right here is going
to be the probability that any

70
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,820
one particular way of making
3 shots and missing 3 shots.

71
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,860
It's going to go in
that cell eventually.

72
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,920
And then you need to know
that you needed the

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,940
binomial coefficient.

74
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,960
It's going to look a
little bit messy now.

75
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,370
So you want n choose k.

76
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,220
So essentially this row is
going to say, what's the

77
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,560
probability for example, in
this cell right here we'll have

78
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,780
the probability of making the
first and missing the next 5,

79
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,170
or missing the first 5
and making the last 1.

80
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,270
They're all going to be
the same probability.

81
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,460
You're going to have
1 make and 5 misses.

82
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,250
And then, this cell we're
going to say, well, how

83
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,840
many different ways can
I make just 1 out of 6?

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,850
And that's why I'm going
to choose 1 out of 6.

85
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,840
k is 1 and n is 6.

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,530
That's going to go there.

87
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,090
And then we can calculate what
the probability that our random

88
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,870
variable is equal to k,
is equal to this value.

89
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,910
And it looks all fancy, but
it's exactly what we did in

90
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,860
the last video with my little
doodle tool that I use.

91
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,850
Which is actually just
Microsoft Paint for those of

92
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,540
you wondering because I get a
lot of e-mails and I'm tired

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,690
of saying it's just
Microsoft Paint.

94
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,270
All right, so what's the
probability that I make 0

95
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,310
and I miss 6 because that's
what they're saying here.

96
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,900
So this is going to be the
probability of me making a

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,380
shot-- and I'll put
those dollar signs.

98
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,330
That kind of fixes
it on this cell.

99
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,950
The probability that I make
a shot to the kth power.

100
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,220
So I make 0 shots times the
probability that I miss a shot.

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,240
Put those dollar signs there so
that it fixes on that cell--

102
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,100
to the n minus k power.

103
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,820
In this case it would
be the sixth power.

104
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,260
I miss 6 six shots, so
to the-- let me put it

105
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,600
in parentheses-- n.

106
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
Let me fix on that cell.

107
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,850
n minus k power.

108
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,650
And there you go there.

109
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,070
That's the probability for
example, of me making the

110
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,280
first and missing the next 5.

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,140
Or this could be the
probability of me getting the

112
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,790
first shot, then missing the
second, and getting

113
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,820
the last 4 missed.

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,540
So any of one of
those situations.

115
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,820
And how many of those
situations are there?

116
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,950
Well that's n choose k.

117
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,280
So that's equal to-- n
choose k-- that's the

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
same thing we did before.

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,530
That's all this
factorial stuff here.

120
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,210
That's n choose k.

121
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,790
So I'm just going to express
the binomial coefficient

122
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,300
expression in Excel.

123
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,280
So it's a factorial of how many
we're choosing from, how many

124
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,640
shots we're taking, and the
Excel function for

125
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,910
that is fact.

126
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,460
So we'll take the factorial of
6 and we'll divide it by--

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,890
put a parentheses here.

128
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:16,020
The factorial of k times
the factorial of n.

129
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,910
Let me fix that n.

130
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,555
Minus k.

131
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,610
And I know it fell off.

132
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,240
n minus k.

133
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,970
You put some parentheses there,
so the parentheses match up.

134
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,890
Actually, this what fixes
on this cell Let me

135
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,450
put an F4 there.

136
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,630
And then there you go.

137
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,030
There's only one way to choose
0 things out of 6 things.

138
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,350
That's what that tells us.

139
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,350
And then the probability that
my random variable is equal to

140
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:47,780
k, or in this case, that I make
exactly 0 shots is equal to the

141
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,490
probability of any of the
specific ways of making 0 shots

142
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,210
times the number of those
ways there are times that.

143
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,600
So that's the probability
of making 0 shots.

144
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,920
And this is a cool thing
about Excel, we can now

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,860
select these cells.

146
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,970
And just go into this right
hand corner, just drag it

147
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,555
down, and it'll do that
calculation for all of them.

148
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,540
And this is neat because
it calculated the

149
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,160
binomial coefficients.

150
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,110
This is 6 choose 3.

151
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,950
n is 6, k is 3.

152
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,440
This is 6 choose 3 is 20.

153
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,990
It's nice and symmetric
like you would expect.

154
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,270
But the probabilities aren't
that symmetric because

155
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,690
we have 0.3 and 0.7.

156
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,490
So it's not like the flipping
a coin example that was

157
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,100
0.5 on either side.

158
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,310
Sorry, these aren't symmetric
and then when you multiply

159
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,880
these, of course, these
don't looks symmetric.

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,580
But it's hard to look at these
numbers, so actually, let's

161
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,160
just use the powers of Excel to
graph this probability

162
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,505
distribution.

163
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:39,100
So let's say insert chart.

164
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm always, I'm clumsy
at inserting charts,

165
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,640
so let me see.

166
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,390
The data-- I think
this is how I do it.

167
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,670
I select the data.

168
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,240
There you go.

169
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,780
And then I need to select the
label, the category x labels.

170
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,310
OK, that's going to
be that right there.

171
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,500
And then let's see.

172
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,630
Next, that looks good.

173
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,470
I don't want to have anything.

174
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,990
I don't need a legend.

175
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,330
I don't want to show a legend.

176
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,550
There you go.

177
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,400
All right.

178
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,160
Now I think I'm finished.

179
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,250
Data labels-- yeah,
that's fine.

180
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:18,720
OK, finish.

181
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,500
I don't want to get too fancy.

182
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,360
Don't want the
letters [INAUDIBLE].

183
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,750
Let me make this
bigger for you.

184
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,380
So this is neat and I wish
they didn't make the font so

185
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,890
big, but you get the point.

186
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,850
This is a discreet probability
distribution of me making, in

187
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,990
this case, k shots out of 6.

188
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,190
And this was based on the fact
that my probability of making

189
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,520
any given shot was 0.3.

190
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,280
Let me see if it'll actually--
and I'm not making any promises

191
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,060
here-- let me see if I can
actually make it so

192
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,800
that it changes.

193
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
If I make it 0.2
does it change?

194
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh, it changed!

195
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,480
Look at that.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,940
That was neat.

197
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,090
Let me bring this
up a little bit.

198
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,860
So what's neat is if I have a
30% chance of making a free

199
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,180
throw, that is my probability
distribution, my discrete

200
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,520
probability distribution
of making k shots.

201
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,170
This is my probability
of making no shots.

202
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,680
I think it was like roughly--
oh, it even gives us it.

203
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,690
Tell us it's 0.12% or it's 12%
chance of making no shots.

204
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,080
My probability of making
4 shots is only 6%.

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,610
I know you can't see it but
that little window that

206
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,260
shows up right under
my pointer says 0.06.

207
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,130
So this is neat.

208
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,700
And since the way we set it up
we can actually change it,

209
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,680
so that if I have a higher
probability of making a shot,

210
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
now it looks pretty symmetric.

211
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,050
Now my chances of making 4
shots is the same as my

212
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,340
chances of making 2 shots.

213
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,250
And if I'm really good at
making baskets, I have

214
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,370
an 80% probability of
making any given shot.

215
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,550
Now, all of a sudden, the
whole distribution has

216
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,620
shifted to the right.

217
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,340
But I just wanted to show you
one, this is, I think, a

218
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,030
pretty neat way to use Excel.

219
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,380
And hopefully, it's
not too daunting.

220
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,570
The other thing is, these are
all examples of binomial

221
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,110
distributions and I wanted to
give you an example that might

222
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,280
be a little bit more relevant
to your everyday life.

223
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,390
The probabilities of making
and missing aren't the

224
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,680
same, they change.

225
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,060
If they are the same
then you end up with a

226
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,430
situation like that.

227
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,070
Let's say you're a horrible
basketball player and you

228
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,430
only have a 10% chance of
making any given shot.

229
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,810
So there's a very high
probability that

230
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,960
you make no shots.

231
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,160
There's a 53% chance you make
no shots and then there's a

232
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,820
35% chance you make one shot,
and so forth and so on.

233
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,610
But this is pretty neat.

234
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,500
This by itself is kind of a fun
little toy and hopefully you

235
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,200
have enough information to do
it yourself, or maybe

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,980
experiment with more.

237
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,010
What happens if you
have more than n?

238
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,420
Actually, maybe I'll do
that in the next video.

239
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,332
Anyway, see you soon.
