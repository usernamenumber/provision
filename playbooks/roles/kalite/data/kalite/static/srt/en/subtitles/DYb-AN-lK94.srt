1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
   

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,796
Now that you've seen some
examples of the chain rule

3
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,930
in use, I think the actual
definition of the chain rule

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,770
might be more digestible now.

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,550
So let me give you the actual
definition of the chain rule.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:27,340
Let's say I have a function f
of x and it equals h of g of x.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,640
And you remember all this
from composite functions.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,350
So the chain rule just says
that the derivative of f of x

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,500
or f prime of x is equal to
the derivative of this inner

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:48,370
function, g prime of x times
the derivative of this h

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,600
function, h prime of x.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,105
But it's not going to
be just h prime of x.

13
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:59,070
It's going to be h
prime of g of x.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,750
So let's apply that to some
examples like we were

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,290
doing before, and I think
it'll make some sense.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:17,870
So let's say we had f of x is
equal to x squared plus 5x

17
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,080
plus 3, all of this
to the fifth power.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,580
So in this example, what's
h of x, what's g of x, and

19
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,440
you know what f of x is.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,240
Well let's say g of x would
be this inner function.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,010
So we would say-- let me pick a
different color-- g of x here

22
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:47,260
is x squared plus 5x plus 3.

23
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,480
It's the stuff, f g of x.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,260
   

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,715
Well h of g of x is this whole
thing, so what would h of x be?

26
00:01:55,715 --> 00:02:01,750
   

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,840
This is h of g of x, but
h of x would just be x

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,940
to the fifth, right?

29
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,530
Because this expression as you
took this entire g of x and you

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,370
put it in for x right here.

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,630
I think that make sense if you
take this entire expression and

32
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,720
you substitute x here for this
entire expression you

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,810
get this expression.

34
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:30,280
And this shows that this
is equal to h of g of x.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,450
If you just take this blue part
and substitute it for x, you

36
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,410
get this entire expression.

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,860
So the chain rule just tells us
that the derivative of this,

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,980
that f prime of x-- and I have
a feeling I'm going to run out

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,570
of space-- f prime of x-- well
actually before I do anything,

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,950
let's figure out the
derivatives of g

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,470
of x and h of x.

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,700
g of x of g prime of x-- let me
draw a little line here to

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,530
divide it out, I know I'm
running out of space.

44
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:03,530
So g prime of x is
equal to 2x plus 5.

45
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,200
   

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,290
2x plus 5, and then derivative
3 is just 0, right?

47
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,150
And the derivative of h of
x? h prime of x is equal

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,410
to 5 x to the fourth.

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,270
So the chain rule just says
that the derivative of this

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,530
entire composite function
is just-- let me just

51
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,240
write it down here.

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,850
I'm doing this to
optimally confuse you.

53
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,050
The derivative of this entire
function is just g prime of x.

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,450
Well we figured out with g
prime of x is here, it's 2x

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:55,260
plus 5 times h times
h prime of g of x.

56
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,310
So what's h prime of g of x?

57
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,750
Well h prime of x is 5x to
the fourth, but we want

58
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,800
h prime of g of x.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:11,330
So h prime of g of x
would equal 5 times g

60
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,190
of x to the fourth.

61
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,310
And we know what g of x is,
it's this whole thing.

62
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,970
So it would be times 5, and
this whole thing x squared

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,990
plus 5x plus 3, all that
to the fourth power.

64
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,815
I think I have truly, truly
confused you, so I'm going

65
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,630
to try to do a couple
of more examples.

66
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,310
Clear this.

67
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,560
OK.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,320
Let me write it up here again.

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:55,870
So if we say that f of x is
equal to h of g of x, then f

70
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:07,055
prime of x is equal to g prime
of x times h prime of g of x.

71
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:09,790
   

72
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,955
So I'll do another example.

73
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:15,270
   

74
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:28,750
Let's say that g of x is equal
to x to the seventh minus

75
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,150
3x to the ninth is 3.

76
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:44,870
And let's say that h of x is
equal to-- let's do something

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,260
reasonably straightforward.

78
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:55,570
Let's say h of x is
x to the minus 10.

79
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,430
So what is f of x? f of x is
just h of g of x, and this

80
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,660
should be a bit of a reminder
from composite functions.

81
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,310
So let's see.

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:15,995
h of g of x would just be-- you
take g of x and you substitute

83
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:25,090
it for x here, so it would just
be this expression, x to the

84
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:31,670
seventh minus 3x to the minus
third, and then all of that

85
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,810
to the minus 10th power.

86
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,720
So this is our f of x.

87
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,700
And this is of course equal to
f of x, right, because f of

88
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,350
x is equal to h of g of x.

89
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,050
I know this very confusing,
but bear with me.

90
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,650
Maybe you have to watch
the video twice and it'll

91
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,130
start making more sense.

92
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,770
Well we want to now figure
out what f prime of x is.

93
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,760
   

94
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,570
Well the chain rule tells us
all it is, is we take the

95
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,930
derivative of g of x, right?

96
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,240
So the derivative
of g of x is what?

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,450
That's easy.

98
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,190
Or hopefully it's easy by now.

99
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,280
Derivative of g of x is 7x to
the sixth, and minus 3 times

100
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,720
minus 3 is plus 9x
to the minus 4.

101
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,790
I just took minus 3 and went
down 1, so that's g prime of x.

102
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,350
   

103
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:31,130
And then times h
prime of g of x.

104
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,550
Well what's h prime of x?

105
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,010
That's easy.

106
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,890
That's just minus 10
times x to the minus 11.

107
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,050
But we want to do h
prime of g of x.

108
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,590
So instead of having an x here,
we're going to substitute that

109
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,320
x with the entire g
of x expression.

110
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:55,760
So this is just times 10 time
something to the minus eleven,

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
and that something
is just g of x.

112
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,310
   

113
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,780
x to the seventh, minus 3x
access to the minus 3.

114
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,780
And there's our answer. f prime
of x is the derivative of kind

115
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,300
of the inner function, g of x,
times the derivative of the

116
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,420
outer function, but instead of
it just being applied to x it'd

117
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,960
be applied to the entire g of x
instead of an x being here.

118
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,470
Maybe I've confused you more.

119
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,680
Let me do one quick example
just to show you that you

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,940
don't have to kind of do this
whole h of g of every time.

121
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,790
   

122
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:48,980
So if I have f of x is equal to
5 times minus x to the eighth,

123
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,180
plus x to the minus eighth,
all of that over to

124
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,630
the fifth power.

125
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,610
If I want to figure out f prime
of x I just take the derivative

126
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,480
of this inner function I guess
I could call it, so that's

127
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,480
minus 8x to the seventh minus
8x-- because it's just take the

128
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,580
negative 8-- to the minus
ninth, times the derivative

129
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,920
of this larger function.

130
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,740
So 5 times 5 is 25 times
something to the fourth.

131
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,440
And that something is just
going to be this expression

132
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,730
minus x to the eighth plus
x to the minus eighth.

133
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,290
And we're done.

134
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,100
You could simplify it.

135
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,080
You could multiply this 25 out
and do et cetera, et cetera.

136
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,540
Hopefully this gives you more
of an intuition of what the

137
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,730
chain rule is all about, and
I'm going to do a lot more

138
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,910
examples in the next couple
of presentations as well.

139
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,250
See you soon.

140
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,550
