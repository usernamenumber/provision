1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
   

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,620
So I was trying to rush and
finish a problem in the last

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,189
two minutes of the video, and
I realize that's just bad

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,980
teaching, because I
end up rushing.

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,810
So this is the problem we were
going to work on, and you'll

7
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,780
see a lot of these.

8
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,890
They just want you to become
familiar with the variables in

9
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,350
Newton's law of gravitation.

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,010
So I said that there's two
planets, one is Earth.

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,100
Now I have time to draw things,
so that's Earth.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,830
And then there's Small Earth.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,470
And Small Earth-- well, maybe
I'll just call it the small

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,370
planet, so we don't
get confused.

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,600
It's green, showing that
there's probably

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,300
life on that planet.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,550
Let's say it has 1/2 the radius,
and 1/2 the mass.

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,300
   

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,625
So if you think about
it, it's probably a

20
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,000
lot denser than Earth.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,550
That's a good problem
to think about.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,150
How much denser is it, right?

23
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,520
Because if you have 1/2 the
radius, your volume is much

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,560
less than 1/2.

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,173
I don't want to go into that
now, but that's something for

26
00:00:58,173 --> 00:00:58,950
you to think about.

27
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,900
But my question is what
fraction, if I'm standing on

28
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,260
the surface of this-- so the
same person, so Sal, if I'm on

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,900
Earth, what fraction is the pull
when I'm on this small

30
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,390
green planet?

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,170
So what is the pull
on me on Earth?

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,620
Well, it's just going to be-- my
weight on Earth, the force

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,510
on Earth, is going to be equal
to the gravitational constant

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,160
times my mass, mass of me.

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,930
So m sub m times the mass of
Earth divided by what?

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,010
We learned in the last video,
divided by the distance

37
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,730
between me and the center
of the mass of Earth.

38
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,740
Really, my center of mass and
the center of mass of Earth.

39
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,820
But this is between the surface
of the Earth, and I'd

40
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,030
like to think that I'm not
short, but it's negligible

41
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,380
between my center of mass and
the surface, so we'll just

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,690
consider the radius
of the Earth.

43
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,290
So we divide it by the radius
of the Earth squared.

44
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,770
   

45
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,820
Using these same variables,
what's going to be the force

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,900
on this other planet?

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,490
So the force on the other
planet, this green planet--

48
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,930
I'll do it in green-- and we're
calling it the small

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,710
planet, it equals what?

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,810
It equals the gravitational
constant again.

51
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,240
And my mass doesn't change when
I go from one planet to

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,850
another, right?

53
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,620
Its mass now is what?

54
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,710
We would write it m
sub s here, right?

55
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,300
This is the small planet.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,850
And we wrote right here that
it's 1/2 the mass of Earth, so

57
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,930
I'll just write that.

58
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,700
So it's 1/2 the mass of Earth.

59
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,190
   

60
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,900
And what's its radius?

61
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,750
What's the radius now?

62
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,100
I could just write the radius
of the small planet squared,

63
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,990
but I'll say, well, we know.

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,920
It's 1/2 the radius of Earth,
so let's put that in there.

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,290
So 1/2 radius of Earth.

66
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,420
We have to square it.

67
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,270
Let's see what this
simplifies to.

68
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:12,760
This equals-- so we can take
this 1/2 here-- 1/2G mass of

69
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,140
me times mass of Earth over--
what's 1/2 squared?

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,260
It's 1/4.

71
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,580
Over 1/4 radius of
Earth squared.

72
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,330
And what's 1/2 divided by 1/4?

73
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,420
1/4 goes into 1/2 two
times, right?

74
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,880
Or another way you can think
about it is if you have a

75
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,500
fraction in the denominator,
when you put it in the

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,020
numerator, you flip it
and it becomes 4.

77
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,060
So 4 times 1/2 is 2.

78
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,760
Either way, it's just math.

79
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,640
So the force on the small planet
is going to be equal to

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,030
1/2 divided by 1/4 is 2 times
G, mass of me, times mass of

81
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,930
Earth, divided by the radius
of Earth squared.

82
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,650
And if we look up here,
this is the same

83
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,445
thing as this, right?

84
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,130
It's identical.

85
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,820
So we know that the force that
applied to me when I'm on the

86
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,660
surface of the small planet is
actually two times the force

87
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,180
applied on Earth, when
I go to Earth.

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,610
And that's something interesting
to think about,

89
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,830
because you might have said
initially, wow, you know, the

90
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,040
mass of the object matters
a lot in gravity.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,270
The more massive the object,
the more it's

92
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,330
going to pull on me.

93
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,640
But what we see here is
that actually, no.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,180
When I'm on the surface of
this smaller planet, it's

95
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,830
pulling even harder on me.

96
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,830
And why is that?

97
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,990
Well, because I'm actually
closer to its center of mass.

98
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,260
And as we talked about earlier
in this video, this object is

99
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,650
probably a lot denser.

100
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,350
You could say it's only 1/2 the
mass, but it's much less

101
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,780
than 1/2 of the volume, right?

102
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,090
Because the volume is the cube
of the radius and all of that.

103
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,920
I don't want to confuse you, but
this is just something to

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,610
think about.

105
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,480
So not only does the mass
matter, but the

106
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,970
radius matters a lot.

107
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,980
And the radius is actually the
square, so it actually

108
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,350
matters even more.

109
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,800
So that's something
that's pretty

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,430
interesting to think about.

111
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,080
And these are actually very
common problems when they just

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,680
want to tell you, oh, you go to
a planet that is two times

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,140
the mass of another planet, et
cetera, et cetera, what is the

114
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,090
difference in force
between the two?

115
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,570
And one thing I want you to
realize, actually, before I

116
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,050
finish this video since I do
have some extra time, when we

117
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,890
think about gravity, especially
with planets and

118
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,500
all of that, you always
feel like, oh, it's

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,400
Earth pulling on me.

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,750
Let's say that this is the
Earth, and the Earth is huge,

121
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,730
and this is a tiny spaceship
right here.

122
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,310
It's traveling.

123
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,190
You always think that
Earth is pulling on

124
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,150
the spaceship, right?

125
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,350
The gravitational
force of Earth.

126
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:57,070
But it actually turns out, when
we looked at the formula,

127
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,980
the formula is symmetric.

128
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,800
It's not really saying one
is pulling on the other.

129
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,570
They're actually saying
this is the force

130
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,420
between the two objects.

131
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,960
They're attracted
to each other.

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:13,580
So if the Earth is pulling on
me with the force of 500

133
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,820
Newtons, it actually turns out
that I am pulling on the Earth

134
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,920
with an equal and opposite
force of 5 Newtons.

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,420
We're pulling towards
each other.

136
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,140
It just feels like the Earth is,
at least from my point of

137
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,220
view, that the Earth
is pulling to me.

138
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,410
And we're actually both being
pulled towards the combined

139
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,180
center of mass.

140
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,050
So in this situation, let's say
the Earth is pulling on

141
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,220
the spaceship with the force
of-- I don't know.

142
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,210
I'm making up numbers
now, but let's say

143
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,970
it's 1 million Newtons.

144
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,320
It actually turns out that the
spaceship will be pulling on

145
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,950
the Earth with the same force
of 1 million Newtons.

146
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,610
And they're both going to be
moved to the combined system's

147
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,900
center of mass.

148
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,320
And the combined system's center
of mass since the Earth

149
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,910
is so much more massive is
going to be very close to

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,790
Earth's center of mass.

151
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,770
It's probably going to
be very close to

152
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,450
Earth's center of mass.

153
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,900
It's going to be like
right there, right?

154
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,070
So in this situation, Earth
won't be doing a lot of

155
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,930
moving, but it will be pulled
in the direction of the

156
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,340
spaceship, and the spaceship
will try to go to Earth's

157
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,680
center of mass, but at some
point, probably the

158
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,750
atmosphere, or the rock that it
runs into, it won't be able

159
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,640
to go much further and
it might crash

160
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,610
right around there.

161
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,420
Anyway, I wanted just to give
you the sense that it's not

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,240
necessarily one object just
pulling on the other.

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,230
They're pulling towards
each other to their

164
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,850
combined center of masses.

165
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,650
It would make a lot more sense
if they had just two people

166
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,210
floating in space, they actually
would have some

167
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,900
gravity towards each other.

168
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,110
It's almost a little romantic.

169
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,970
They would float
to each other.

170
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,910
And actually, you could
figure it out.

171
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,030
I don't have the time to do
it, but you could use this

172
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,010
formula and use the constant,
and you could figure out,

173
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,350
well, what is the gravitational
attraction

174
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,560
between two people?

175
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
And what you'll see is that
between two people floating in

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,850
space, there are other forms
of attraction that are

177
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,150
probably stronger than their

178
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,380
gravitational attraction, anyway.

179
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,520
I'll let you ponder that
and I will see

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,410
you in the next video.

181
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:15,900
