1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,810
Problem 13.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,460
These eight cards are placed face down and shuffled.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,800
So these are the eight cards.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,430
If Beatrice turns over only one card,

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,300
what is the probability that she will get a card

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,870
with a number less than four?

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,200
So all of these cards right here are potential outcomes.

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,720
She's going to flip them all over.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,030
And then she wants to know the probability that

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,800
she gets a card less than four.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,990
So what are the cards that satisfy that?

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,530
Well, there's three cards that are less than four.

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,980
They didn't say less than or equal to four.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,820
So it could be that card, that card, or that card.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,630
Those are the cards that she can pick,

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,280
out of the eight cards,

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,300
that would satisfy this constraint.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,990
Or those would be the three outcomes,

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,840
out of the eight possible outcomes,

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,940
that would satisfy these conditions.

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,550
So the probability is just three cards

22
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,050
that satisfy your condition

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,720
divided by the total number of outcomes.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,310
So the probability of her picking a card

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,110
that is less than four--

26
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,250
there's three cards that are less than four

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,730
out of eight cards.

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,430
The probability is 3/8.

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,530
And that is choice B.

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,430
Always nice when our answer is actually there.

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,550
OK.

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,790
Problem-- what's the next problem?

33
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,210
Problem 14.

34
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,070
The Smithburg town library wanted to see

35
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,360
what types of books were borrowed most often.

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,530
All right, there we go.

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,180
They drew a little pie diagram.

38
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,580
According to the circle graph shown above--

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,160
OK, let's see which of these statements are true.

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,660
The first statement says,

41
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,900
"more Children's books were borrowed than Romance

42
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,880
and Science Fiction combined."

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,900
Let's see if that's true.

44
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,140
Children's is 26%,

45
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,530
and then Romance and Science Fiction combined.

46
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,880
Romance is 13, and Science Fiction is 18.

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,520
So what's 13 plus 18?

48
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,200
3 plus 8 is 11.

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,810
And then we have 1 plus 1 plus 1.

50
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,020
And so then we get 31.

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,620
So if you take Romance and Science Fiction combined,

52
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,050
that's 31% of the books,

53
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,700
while the Children's books were only 26%.

54
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,980
So that is definitely not correct.

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,950
More than half of the books borrowed were Children's,

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,500
Mysteries, and Art combined.

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,230
So more than half would mean it has to be more than 50%.

58
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,940
So they think Children's, Mysteries, and Art combined.

59
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,090
So let's see what that gets.

60
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,720
Children's-- I'll do it in a different color.

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,030
Children's, Mysteries, and Art.

62
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,850
So Children's and Mysteries, if you add those together,

63
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,420
26 plus 20, that gives you 46%.

64
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,050
And then you add another 4% to that.

65
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,530
We're combining with Art.

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,380
That gets us to 50%.

67
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,960
So exactly half the books borrowed were Children's,

68
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,270
Mysteries, and Art.

69
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,050
But they're saying more than half.

70
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,570
This is exactly half.

71
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,860
So this doesn't seem right either.

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,580
If they said half or more,

73
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,270
then we would have picked this choice.

74
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,550
But they said definitely more than 50%, so that can't be it.

75
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,230
Although it's kind of a tricky one, because it's exactly 50%

76
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,690
C, more Mysteries were borrowed than Art

77
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,770
and Science Fiction combined.

78
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,850
Mysteries was 20%, and then Art

79
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,220
and Science Fiction combined is 4 plus 18.

80
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,230
If you combine these two, you get 4 plus 18 is 22%.

81
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,220
So the Mysteries are definitely not more than

82
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,120
the Art and Science Fiction combined.

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,780
So that's not the correct answer.

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,530
And then finally, more than half of the books--

85
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,320
this is probably going to be our answer,

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,720
if we haven't made any silly mistakes.

87
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,370
This says more than half of the books borrowed were Romance,

88
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,880
Mysteries, and Science Fiction combined.

89
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,080
Let's see that.

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:10,610
Romance, Mysteries, and Science Fiction.

91
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,370
We already know Romance plus Science Fiction,

92
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,540
that was 13 plus 18, which we already figured out was 31%.

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,250
These two could combine at 31%,

94
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,810
and then you add that 31% to the Mysteries.

95
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,580
So it becomes 51%.

96
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,900
So that's right.

97
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,690
This is 51% of the books borrowed.

98
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,580
So that's definitely more than half of the books,

99
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,600
so the correct choice here is D.
