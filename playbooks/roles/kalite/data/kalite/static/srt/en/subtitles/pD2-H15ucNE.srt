1
00:00:00,822 --> 00:00:03,053
Multiply negative four x squared by

2
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,623
the whole expression

3
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:06,337
three x squared plus twenty five x

4
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:08,060
minus seven

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,340
So if you multiply anything

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,084
times a whole expression you really just use

7
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:13,605
the distributive property to multiply each term

8
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:15,107
of the expression by

9
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,485
the negative four x squared

10
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:17,952
so we're going to have to distribute

11
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,402
this negative four x squared

12
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,473
over every term in the expression.

13
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:23,513
So first we can start with

14
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:25,462
negative four x squared times

15
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:26,852
three x squared

16
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:27,877
so we can write that

17
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:30,332
we're gonna have negative four x squared

18
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:32,765
times three x squared

19
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,057
and to that we're going to add

20
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:39,810
negative four x squared times twenty five x

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,761
times twenty five x

22
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:44,509
and to that we're going to add

23
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:49,204
negative four x squared times negative seven

24
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:51,992
times negative seven

25
00:00:51,992 --> 00:00:53,772
So let's just simplify this a little bit

26
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,451
Now we can obviously swap the order

27
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:58,313
we're just multiplying negative four times

28
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,328
x squared times three times x squared

29
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,403
and actually I'll do out every step

30
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:03,296
eventually you can do some of this in your head

31
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,932
this is the exact same thing as negative four

32
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,661
times three times x squared times

33
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,165
x squared

34
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,616
And what is that equal to?

35
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,551
well negative four times three

36
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,422
is negative twelve

37
00:01:16,422 --> 00:01:17,918
and x squared times x squared

38
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:19,697
same base, we're taking the product

39
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,262
that's going to be x to the fourth

40
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:23,007
so this right here is

41
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,999
negative twelve x to the fourth

42
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,405
Now let's think about this term over here

43
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:28,522
this term over here

44
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,295
This the same thing as

45
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:32,177
And of course we have this plus out here

46
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:33,391
We have this plus

47
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:34,692
And then this part right here is

48
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:36,875
the exact same thing as twenty five

49
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,924
twenty five times negative four

50
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:43,425
times x squared times x

51
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:46,530
So let's just multiply the numbers out here

52
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,932
These were the coefficients.

53
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:49,884
Twenty five times negative four is

54
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:51,001
negative a hundred.

55
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,229
So it'll be plus negative a hundred

56
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,071
or we could just say it's minus one hundred

57
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,093
And then we have x squared times x

58
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:59,953
or x squared times x to the first power

59
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,875
Same base, we can add the exponents.

60
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,992
Two plus one is three.

61
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:08,189
So this is negative a hundred x to the third power

62
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:10,678
And then let's look at this last term over here

63
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:12,293
We have negative four x squared

64
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:13,481
So this is going to be plus

65
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:14,788
That's this plus right over here

66
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:15,896
We have

67
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,204
We have negative four

68
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,580
We can multiply that times negative seven

69
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,896
And then multiply that times x squared

70
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:23,891
I'm just changing the order

71
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:25,386
in which we multiply

72
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,481
So negative four times negative seven is

73
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,976
positive twenty eight.

74
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:30,480
Positive twenty eight

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,944
and then I'm gonna multiply that times

76
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,826
the x squared

77
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,151
times the x squared

78
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,574
There's no simplification to do

79
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,640
No like terms

80
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,321
These are different powers of x.

81
00:02:39,321 --> 99:59:59,999
So we are done.
