1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,400
In a local teaching district,
a technology grant is

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,410
available to teachers in order
to install a cluster of four

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,160
computers in their classroom.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,290
From the 6,250 teachers in the
district, 250 were randomly

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,590
selected and asked if they felt
that computers were an

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,410
essential teaching tool
for their classroom.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,770
Of those selected, 142 teachers
felt that the

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,490
computers were an essential
teaching tool.

10
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,920
And then they ask us, calculate
a 99% confidence

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,040
interval for the proportion of
teachers who felt that the

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,690
computers are an essential
teaching tool.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,460
So let's just think about
the entire population.

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,000
We weren't able to survey all
of them, but the entire

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,230
population, some of them fall
in the bucket, and we'll

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,950
define that as 1, they thought
it was a good tool.

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,920
They thought that the computers
were a good tool.

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,670
And we'll just define a
0 value as a teacher

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,100
that says not good.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,140
And some proportion of the total
teachers think that it

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,050
is a good learning tool.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,960
So that proportion is p.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,820
And then the rest of them think
it's a bad learning

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,890
tool, 1 minus p.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,560
We have a Bernoulli Distribution
right over here,

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,840
and we know that the mean of
this distribution or the

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,010
expected value of this
distribution is

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,080
actually going to be p.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,230
So it's actually going to be a
value, it's neither 0 or 1, so

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,160
not an actual value that you
could actually get out of a

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,460
teacher if you were
to ask them.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,550
They cannot say something in
between good and not good.

33
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,050
The actual expected value
is something in between.

34
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,720
It is p.

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,240
Now what we do is we're taking
a sample of those 250

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,000
teachers, and we got that 142
felt that the computers were

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040
an essential teaching tool.

38
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:06,530
So in our survey, so we had 250
sampled, and we got 142

39
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,509
said that it is good, and we'll
say that this is a 1.

40
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:15,030
So we got 142 1's, or we sampled
1, 142 times from this

41
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,990
distribution.

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,290
And then the rest of the time,
so what's left over?

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,580
There's another 108 who said
that it's not good.

44
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,190
So 108 said not good, or you
could view them as you were

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,810
sampling a 0, right?

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,390
108 plus 142 is 250.

47
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,610
So what is our sample
mean here?

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:46,460
We have 1 times 142, plus 0
times 108 divided by our total

49
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,390
number of samples,
divided by 250.

50
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,710
It is equal to 142 over 250.

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,920
You could even view this as
the sample proportion of

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,770
teachers who thought that
the computers were a

53
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,915
good teaching tool.

54
00:02:57,915 --> 00:03:01,100
Now let me get a calculator
out to calculate this.

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:09,050
So we have 142 divided by
250 is equal to 0.568.

56
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,330
So our sample proportion
is 0.568.

57
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,680
or 56.8%, either one.

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,910
So 0.568.

59
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,410
Now let's also figure out our
sample variance because we can

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,630
use it later for building
our confidence interval.

61
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,630
Our sample variance here--
so let me draw a sample

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,900
variance-- we're going to take
the weighted sum of the square

63
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,020
differences from the mean and
divide by this minus 1.

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,990
So we can get the best

65
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,140
estimator of the true variance.

66
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:45,950
So it's 1 times-- no, it's the
other way actually around-- we

67
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:56,160
have 142 samples that were 1
minus 0.568 away from our

68
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,470
sample mean, or we're this far
from the sample mean 142

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,690
times, and we're going to
square those distances.

70
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,700
Plus the other 108 times we got
a 0, so we were 0 minus

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,810
0.568 away from the
sample mean.

72
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,130
And then we are going to divide
that by the total

73
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,280
number of samples minus 1.

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,040
That minus 1 is our adjuster
so that we don't

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
underestimate.

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,290
So 250 minus 1.

77
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,785
Let's get our calculator
out again.

78
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:34,650
   

79
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,140
And so we have 100-- we put
a parentheses around

80
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:52,560
everything-- I have 142 times
1 minus 0.568 squared, plus

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,330
108 times 0 minus-- and you
could obviously do parts of

82
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,650
this in your head, but I'm just
going to write the whole

83
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:10,830
thing out-- minus 0.568 squared,
and then all of that

84
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,960
divided by 250 minus 1 is 249.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,300
So our sample variance is--
well, I'll just say 0.246.

86
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,820
It is equal to-- it is our
sample variance-- I'll write

87
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:32,420
it over here-- our sample
variance is equal to 0.246.

88
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,910
If you were to take the square
root of that our actual sample

89
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:42,290
standard deviation is going to
be, let's take the square root

90
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:49,450
of that answer right over there,
and we get 0.496 is

91
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,900
equal to 0.

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,310
I'll just round that
up to 0.50.

93
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,710
So that is our sample
standard deviation.

94
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,580
Now this interval, let's think
of it this way, we are

95
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,450
sampling from some sampling
distribution

96
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,390
of the sample mean.

97
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,980
So it looks like this
over here, it

98
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,870
looks that over there.

99
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:18,490
And it has some mean, and so
the mean of the sampling

100
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,130
distribution of the sample mean
is actually going to be

101
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,150
the same thing as this mean over
here-- it's going to be

102
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,200
the same mean value-- which
is the same thing as our

103
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,570
population proportion.

104
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,920
We've seen this multiple
times.

105
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,970
And the sampling distribution's
standard

106
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,710
deviation, so the standard
deviation of the sampling

107
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,290
distribution, so we could view
that as one standard deviation

108
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,440
right over there.

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,310
So the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution,

110
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,020
we've seen multiple times,
is equal to the standard

111
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,760
deviation-- let me do this in
a different color-- is equal

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,690
to the standard deviation of
our original population

113
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,846
divided by the square root
of the number of samples.

114
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:10,890
   

115
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,620
So it's divided by 250.

116
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,800
Now we do not know this
right over here.

117
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,130
We do not know the actual
standard deviation in our

118
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,230
population.

119
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,040
But our best estimate of that,
and that's why we call it

120
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,280
confident, we're confident that
the real mean or the real

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,710
population proportion, is going
to be in this interval.

122
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,200
We're confident, but we're not
100% sure because we're going

123
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,140
to estimate this over here, and
if we're estimating this

124
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,960
we're really estimating
that over there.

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
So if this can be estimated it's
going to be estimated by

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,875
the sample standard deviation.

127
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,250
   

128
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,400
So then we can say this is going
to be approximately, or

129
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,830
if we didn't get a weird,
completely skewed sample, it

130
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,860
actually might not even be
approximately if we just had a

131
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,550
really strange sample.

132
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,960
But maybe we should write
confident that-- we are

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,930
confident that the standard
deviation of our sampling

134
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,730
distribution is going to be
around, instead of using this

135
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,200
we can use our standard
deviation of our sample, our

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,210
sample standard deviation.

137
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:28,100
So 0.50 divided by the square
root of 250, and what's that

138
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,020
going to be?

139
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,330
That is going to be-- so we
have this value right over

140
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,360
here, and actually I don't have
to round it, divided by

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,970
the square root of 250.

142
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,190
We get 0.031.

143
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,290
So this is equal to
0.031 over here.

144
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,870
So that's one standard
deviation.

145
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,700
Now they want a 99% confidence
interval.

146
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,290
So the way I think about it is
if I randomly pick a sample

147
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,370
from the sampling distribution,
what's the 99%

148
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,560
chance, or how many-- let
me think of it this way.

149
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,230
How many standard deviations
away from the mean do we have

150
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,120
to be that we can be 99%
confident that any sample from

151
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,150
the sampling distribution will
be in that interval?

152
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,880
So another way to think about
think it, think about how many

153
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,660
standard deviations we need to
be away from the mean, so

154
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,460
we're going to be a certain
number of standard deviations

155
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:38,550
away from the mean such that any
sample, any mean that we

156
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,020
sample from here, any sample
from this distribution has a

157
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,360
99% chance of being plus or
minus that many standard

158
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,900
deviations.

159
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,750
So it might be from
there to there.

160
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,780
So that's what we want.

161
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,880
We want a 99% chance that if
we pick a sample from the

162
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,710
sampling distribution of the
sample mean, it will be within

163
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,260
this many standard deviations
of the actual mean.

164
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,890
And to figure that out let's
look at an actual Z-table.

165
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,330
So we want 99% confidence.

166
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,040
So another way to think about it
if we want 99% confidence,

167
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,270
if we just look at the upper
half right over here, that

168
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:21,230
orange area should be 0.475,
because if this is 0.475 then

169
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,890
this other part's going to be
0.475, and we will get to

170
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,580
our-- oh sorry, we want
to get to 99%, so it's

171
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,340
not going to be 0.475.

172
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:38,330
We're going to have to go
to 0.495 if we want 99%

173
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:38,870
confidence.

174
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,300
So this area has to be 0.495
over here, because if that is,

175
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,940
that over here will also be.

176
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,560
So that their sum will
be 99% of the area.

177
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,390
Now if this is 0.495, this value
on the z table right

178
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,225
here will have to be 0.5,
because all of this area, if

179
00:10:56,225 --> 00:10:58,870
you include all of this
is going to be 0.5.

180
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,590
So it's going to be
0.5 plus 0.495.

181
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:11,090
It's going to be 0.995.

182
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,350
Let me make sure I
got that right.

183
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,420
0.995.

184
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,480
So let's look at our Z-table.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,530
So where do we get 0.995.

186
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,570
on our z table?

187
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,190
0.995.

188
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,380
is pretty close, just to have
a little error, it will be

189
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,660
right over here--
this is 0.9951.

190
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,800
So another way to think about it
is 99-- so this value right

191
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,760
here gives us the whole
cumulative area up to that, up

192
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,200
to our mean.

193
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,620
So if you look at the entire
distribution like this, this

194
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,610
is the mean right over here.

195
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,580
This tells us that at 2.5
standard deviations above the

196
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,550
mean, so this is 2.5 standard
deviations above the mean.

197
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,140
So this is 2.5 times the
standard deviation of the

198
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,430
sampling distribution.

199
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,200
If you look at this whole area,
this whole area over

200
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,320
here, if you look at the
Z-table, is going to be

201
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:18,260
0.9951, which tells us that just
this area right over here

202
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,120
is going to be 0.4951, which
tells us that this area plus

203
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,040
the symmetric area of that many
standard deviations below

204
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,870
the mean, if you combine
them, 0.4951 times

205
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,060
2 gets us to 99.2.

206
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,780
So this whole area right
here is 99.992.

207
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,950
So if we look at the area 2.5
standard deviations above and

208
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,080
below the mean-- oh,
let me be careful.

209
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,440
This isn't just 2.5,
we have to add

210
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,590
another digit of precision.

211
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,140
This is 2.5, and the next digit
of precision is given by

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,030
this column over here.

213
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,070
So we have to look all the way
up into the second to the last

214
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,100
column, and we have to add
a digit of 8 here.

215
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,856
So this is 2.58 standard
deviations.

216
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,660
   

217
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,000
We have 2.5 over here, and then
we get the next digit 8

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,180
from the column.

219
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,360
2.58 standard deviations above
and below the standard

220
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,780
deviation encompasses a little
over 99% of the total

221
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,690
probability.

222
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,700
So there's a little over a 99%
chance that any sample mean

223
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,610
that I select from the sampling
distribution of the

224
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,150
sample mean will fall
within this much of

225
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,000
the standard deviation.

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,190
So let me put it this way.

227
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:40,770
There is a 99-- it's actually,
what, a 99.2% chance, right?

228
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,890
If you multiply this times 2
you get 0.99-- actually you

229
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,680
get 0.9902.

230
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:57,940
So we'll say roughly 99% chance
that any sample that a

231
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:11,840
random sample mean is within
2.58 standard deviations of

232
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:20,120
the sampling mean of the mean
of the sampling distribution

233
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,650
of the sampling mean, which is
the same thing as our actual

234
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,820
population mean, which is the
same thing as our population

235
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,800
proportion.

236
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,670
So of p.

237
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,200
And we know what this
value is right here.

238
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,550
At least we have a decent
estimate for this value.

239
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,390
We don't know exactly what this
is, but our best estimate

240
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,160
for this value is
this over here.

241
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,300
So we could re-write this, so
we could say that we are

242
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,770
confident because we are really
using an estimator to

243
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,330
get this value here.

244
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:58,530
We are confident that there is
a 99% chance that a random x,

245
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,820
a random sample mean, is
within-- and let's figure out

246
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,480
this value right here
using a calculator.

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,140
So it is 2.58 times our best
estimate of the standard

248
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,360
deviation of the sampling
distribution, so times 0.031

249
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,420
is equal to 0.0-- well let's
just round this up because

250
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:37,670
it's so close to 0.08-- is
within 0.08 of the population

251
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,650
proportion.

252
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,690
Or you could say that you're
confident that the population

253
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,850
proportion is within 0.08
of your sample mean.

254
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,710
That's the exact
same statement.

255
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,230
So if we want our confidence
interval, our actual number

256
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,330
that we got for there,
our actual sample

257
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,500
mean we got was 0.568.

258
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,620
So we could replace this, and
actually let me do it.

259
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,290
I can delete this right here.

260
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,350
Let me clear it.

261
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,430
I can replace this, because we
actually did take a sample.

262
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,530
So I can replace this
with 0.568.

263
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,940
So we could be confident that
there's a 99% chance that

264
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:28,010
0.568 is within 0.08 of the
population proportion, which

265
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,700
is the same thing as the
population mean, which is the

266
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,820
same thing as the mean of the
sampling distribution of the

267
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,780
sample mean, so forth
and so on.

268
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,760
And just to make it clear we can
actually swap these two.

269
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,920
It wouldn't change
the meaning.

270
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,350
If this is within 0.08
of that, then that is

271
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,930
within 0.08 of this.

272
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,170
So let me switch this
up a little bit.

273
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,910
So we could put a p is within
of-- let me switch

274
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,500
this up-- of 0.568.

275
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,560
And now linguistically it sounds
a little bit more like

276
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,820
a confidence interval.

277
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,290
We are confident that there's a
99% chance that p is within

278
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,050
0.08 of the sample
mean of 0.568.

279
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,099
So what would be our confidence
interval?

280
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,730
It will be 0.568 plus
or minus 0.08.

281
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,980
And what would that be?

282
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,530
If you add 0.08 to this right
over here, at the upper end

283
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,060
you're going to have 0.648.

284
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,339
And at the lower end of our
range, so this is the upper

285
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,330
end, the lower end.

286
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,080
If we subtract 8 from
this we get 0.488.

287
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,130
So we are 99% confident that the
true population proportion

288
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,430
is between these two numbers.

289
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,570
Or another way, that the true
percentage of teachers who

290
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,760
think those computers are good
ideas is between-- we're 99%

291
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,430
confident-- we're confident that
there's a 99% chance that

292
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,390
the true percentage of teachers
that like the

293
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,970
computers is between
48.8% and 64.8%.

294
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,870
Now we answered the first
part of the question.

295
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,670
The second part, how could the
survey be changed to narrow

296
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,710
the confidence interval,
but to maintain the

297
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,000
99% confidence interval?

298
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,740
Well, you could just
take more samples.

299
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,910
If you take more samples than
our estimate of the standard

300
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,290
deviation of this distribution
will go down because this

301
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,370
denominator will be higher.

302
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,470
If the denominator is higher
then this whole

303
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,870
thing will go down.

304
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,050
So if the standard deviations
go down here, then when we

305
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,850
count the standard deviations,
when we do the plus or minus

306
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,120
on the range, this value
will go down and

307
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
will narrow our range.

308
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,650
So you just take more samples.

309
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,067
