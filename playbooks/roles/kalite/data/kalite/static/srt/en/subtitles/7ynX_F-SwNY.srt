1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,980
In the last video we discovered
what seems like a

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,580
problem with the Calvin Cycle.

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,350
That you have this big protein
here, enzyme, that facilitates

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,290
the Calvin Cycle.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,790
All of the molecules that are
involved bond to this and then

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,680
it twists and turns and it jams
things together so that

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,570
they react properly.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,900
And we know what this
is, the RuBisCo.

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,890
RuBisCo enzyme, or ribulose

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,140
bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,240
   

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,770
And we know when the Calvin
Cycle operates properly you'll

14
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,880
have some carbon dioxide
attached in one

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,240
part of this enzyme.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,440
And then you'll have some RuBP,
or maybe you could call

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,390
it the proper word, ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,880
And they're going to react.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,650
And then after they react, if
everything with the Calvin

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,040
Cycle is going properly, they're
going to react and

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,830
form-- they're going to be
jammed together and then split

22
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,000
into-- for one molecule of that
and one molecule of that,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,550
you're going to have
two molecules of

24
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,800
3-phosphoglycerate.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,760
   

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,340
In the last video I started with
three of these and three

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,180
of these so I ended up
with six of these.

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,190
But for every one of these you
end up with two of these.

29
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,050
This is the proper
Calvin Cycle.

30
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,730
Then these turn into your
phosphoglyceraldehydes.

31
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,540
These turn into two

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,590
phosphoglyceraldehydes, or PGALs.

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,120
   

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,750
And then for every six of these
that are produced-- and

35
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,640
maybe I should write a three
here, a three here and then

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,170
I'll have six of these-- and
for every six of these that

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,840
are produced, five go back into
the cycle to produce.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
So five PGALs, or glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate go

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,940
back into the cycle to produce
the ribulose bisphosphate.

40
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,370
And one of them is kind of our
end product of photosynthesis

41
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,530
that can be used to produce
other carbohydrates.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,060
So, one PGAL.

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,280
And the whole problem, we saw
with the Calvin Cycle, is that

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,420
RuBisCo does not only
fix carbon dioxide.

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,320
That instead of carbon
dioxide we might

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,509
have an oxygen molecule.

47
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,890
We might have an oxygen molecule
that jumps in here.

48
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,110
And it can also attach to
the RuBisCo enzyme.

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,090
And in that situation, the
oxygen and the ribulose

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,050
bisphosphate react.

51
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,220
So if we had three ribulose
bisphosphates and three

52
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,780
oxygens, instead of producing
six phosphoglycerates we're

53
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,710
only going to produce five
phosphoglycerates and we're

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,905
going to produce five
phosphoglycolates.

55
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:43,090
   

56
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,590
Which is that byproduct that
gets processed later on.

57
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,520
And then these five.

58
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
You're going to have
five here.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,890
You can't have one left over.

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,420
And then you're not going
to produce anything.

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,380
In doing this whole cycle
you have to use up a

62
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,960
bunch of ATPs and NADHs.

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,440
So this is a problem.

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,290
If there's a lot of oxygen
present, or even a little bit

65
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,300
of oxygen present, it's
going to make this a

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,920
little bit less efficient.

67
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,410
Because every now and then an
oxygen's going to jump in

68
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,770
where a carbon dioxide is needed
to actually produce an

69
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,660
actual carbohydrate
in the end.

70
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,800
So how do plants solve
this problem?

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,140
Well, one solution would be to
operate the Calvin Cycle in an

72
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,500
environment where there is
very, very little oxygen.

73
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,900
Or you can almost
say no oxygen.

74
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,780
And this is exactly what
some plants do.

75
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,980
You're like, wait,
how do I do that?

76
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,600
Do I have to go to a planet
where there's no oxygen?

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:32,850
No!

78
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,980
What they do is-- and to
understand this we'll have to

79
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,173
understand a little bit of
the actual make-up of

80
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:41,100
the leaf of a plant.

81
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,990
And that doesn't hurt because
everything we've been doing

82
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,190
now has been biochemistry.

83
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,670
it's nice to see leaves.

84
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,750
So if I draw-- let's say
that that is a leaf.

85
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,880
That is a leaf.

86
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,990
I can make it look
nice like a leaf.

87
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,620
That's a nice looking leaf.

88
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,320
On your leaf's surface, and
actually on both sides of it,

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,360
you have these little pores,
these little holes on the

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,930
leaf's surface.

91
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,020
They are actually surrounded
by these things

92
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,930
called guard cells.

93
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,780
But the important thing is that
these little pores-- and

94
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,940
they're actually much smaller
than that; you'd have to get a

95
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,850
microscope to actually see
them-- they're called stomata.

96
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,570
Or one individual of
these pores or

97
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,579
holes is called a stoma.

98
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,940
And this is where the oxygen
and the-- mainly the carbon

99
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,920
dioxide-- but this is where the
air enters the cell and

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,870
this is actually where
water vapor is also

101
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,860
released from the cell.

102
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,420
If we draw a cross section of
a leaf, so let me do my best

103
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,810
to draw a cross section
like this.

104
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,280
Let me draw it like that
and maybe that's the

105
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,300
bottom of the leaf.

106
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,820
This would be my stoma.

107
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,640
This is the actual opening.

108
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,410
This is the actual opening and
plants can actually open and

109
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,660
close their stomata.

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,600
   

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,760
The plural of stoma
is stomata.

112
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,520
They can open and close
their stomata.

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,760
But the important thing to
realize is what's going on

114
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,390
inside the cell.

115
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,810
So most plants, you have this
whole photosynthetic process,

116
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,180
or photosynthesis process,
occurring in these mesophyll

117
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,090
cells, which are really just
these middle layer cells.

118
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,180
And I'll do a detailed video
in the future about the

119
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,970
anatomy of a plant.

120
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,530
But these are the
mesophyll cells.

121
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,880
This is where photosynthesis
normally occurrs.

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,890
And because they use carbon
dioxide, or they need air--

123
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,110
actually I drew it wrong.

124
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,990
Let me draw it a little
bit better.

125
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,050
There's actually space
between them, so that

126
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,520
air can get to them.

127
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,710
There's mesophyll, I'm doing
a very rough drawing.

128
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,950
But in this situation air can
enter through a stoma and then

129
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,650
it can fill the space between
these mesophyll cells and it

130
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,010
can provide air to the
mesophyll cells.

131
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,740
And when I say air, that air is
made up of carbon dioxide

132
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,440
and oxygen and nitrogen
and all the things

133
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,170
that are in our air.

134
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,320
And of course, it needs the
carbon dioxide to actually

135
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,560
perform the Calvin Cycle.

136
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,810
Now, we just said that it's
not just getting CO2.

137
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,940
If it was just getting CO2
you wouldn't worry about

138
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,430
photorespiration.

139
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,170
It's also getting oxygen.

140
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,280
It's also getting molecular
oxygen.

141
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,430
So what can the plant to
do to prevent this?

142
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,770
And not all plants-- you know,
most plants just deal with

143
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,570
photorespiration.

144
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,540
It's just a little less
efficient than the ideal.

145
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,440
But some plants have-- I guess
we could say-- evolved past

146
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,120
the photorespiration problem.

147
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,490
And these are called
C-4 plants.

148
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,290
Or they perform C-4
photosynthesis.

149
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,300
   

150
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,500
And we'll understand, hopefully
in a few minutes,

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,000
why it's called C-4.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,980
Just as a reminder, when we go
up to the mechanism up here.

153
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,020
The classic Calvin Cycle, the
first byproduct is this

154
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,850
phosphoglycerate, this
is a 3-carbon chain.

155
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,870
So it's saying that the first
time that you fix carbon

156
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,230
dioxide, or actually the first
time you fix carbon dioxide or

157
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,220
oxygen, but let's say the first
time you fix carbon

158
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,810
dioxide you end up with a
3-carbon chain molecule.

159
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,680
That's why this is called
C-3 photosynthesis.

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,310
So, that's a clue.

161
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,340
On C-4 plants, the very first
time that they fix carbon

162
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,870
dioxide they must end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

163
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,150
And what they do-- and this is
the interesting thing-- is you

164
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,350
have all your mesophyll cells
that are out here.

165
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,110
They're getting air.

166
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,030
They're getting carbon
dioxide.

167
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,480
You know, they're getting carbon
dioxide and they're

168
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,590
getting oxygen and
whatever else.

169
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,550
So you have all your mesophyll
cells that are getting air.

170
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,555
But you also have cells that
are deeper within, more

171
00:07:31,555 --> 00:07:35,150
embedded within the leaf that
aren't being exposed directly

172
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,060
to the air coming through
the stomata.

173
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,700
So you have these bundle-sheath
cells.

174
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,450
And these are actually the cells
that surround the actual

175
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,300
pipes in the plant that
distribute the fluid up and

176
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,760
down the plant.

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,880
And we'll do a whole video on
the anatomy of the plant.

178
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,560
I really just want you to
understand what's going on in

179
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,420
C-4 photosynthesis.

180
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,700
So you have these other cells
that are more embedded.

181
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,250
They don't have direct
access to the air.

182
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,930
So these are bundle-sheath
cells.

183
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,950
   

184
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,460
And what these plants do is,
the carbon dioxide comes in

185
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,030
and-- so in the standard Calvin
Cycle, everything

186
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,040
happens in the mesophyll cells
and you have to deal with

187
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,360
photorespiration.

188
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,100
In your C-4 plant, or your
plants performing C-4

189
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,950
photosynthesis, what happens
is the carbon dioxide comes

190
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,820
in-- so this is in the
mesophyll cell.

191
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,020
Let me be neat about it.

192
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:37,150
So in our mesophyll cell, that's
that right there, you

193
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,350
have CO2 coming in
and it reacts.

194
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,930
Instead of reacting with RuBP
or ribulose bisphosphate, it

195
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:50,580
reacts with another very hairy
sounding compound, we'll just

196
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,610
call it PEP.

197
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,580
But it's phosphoenolpyruvate
So that's PEP.

198
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,880
You just have to remember,
it is a 3-carbon chain.

199
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,140
Now let me write down the word,
because sometimes you

200
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,640
might want to know, what
does PEP stand for?

201
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,470
It's phosphoenolpyruvate or

202
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,910
phosphoenolpyruvic acid Either way.

203
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,440
   

204
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,270
3-carbon molecule, it's got
other stuff hanging off of

205
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,930
this but we just have to
remember the carbons.

206
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,620
So when these two react what are
you going to end up with?

207
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,870
Well you could guess.

208
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,930
You have one carbon, you
have three carbons.

209
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,965
You're going to end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

210
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:37,750
   

211
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,980
And this reaction right here
is facilitated, not by

212
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,460
RuBisCo, ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

213
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,840
   

214
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,720
It's facilitated by a
different enzyme.

215
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
And this is the key.

216
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,310
This is the key for C-4.

217
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,970
This is a different enzyme.

218
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,360
This is called PEP
carboxylase.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,740
Let me write it down.

220
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,990
PEP carboxylase.

221
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,330
   

222
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,710
And that's a fitting name.

223
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:09,880
Remember, RuBisCo or ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase, it

224
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,480
reacted ribulose bisphosphate
with carbon or oxygen.

225
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,570
That's where that oxygenase
comes from.

226
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,410
But now we have something
that reacts PEP, our

227
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,580
phosphoenolpyruvate with
carbon dioxide.

228
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,780
So it's called PEP
carboxylase.

229
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,800
Actually this is carboxylase,
not carboxylate.

230
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,320
   

231
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,330
It's an enzyme.

232
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,900
This is PEP carboxylase.

233
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,370
And what's special about PEP
carboxylase, and why it's

234
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,920
useful in preventing
photorespiration, is that it

235
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,405
can only fix carbon.

236
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:46,820
   

237
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,420
Not oxygen.

238
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,950
So you can imagine, this
is occurring in

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,830
the mesophyll cell.

240
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,020
You have oxygen and carbon
dioxide running around here.

241
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,305
But only carbon dioxide can
react with the PEP via the PEP

242
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,960
carboxylase.

243
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,760
So then they react, they
actually produce oxaloacetic

244
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:15,210
acid or oxaloacetate And you
might remember this from the

245
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,960
Kreb Cycle.

246
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,510
This was the thing that was the
first reactive species in

247
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,330
our Kreb Cycle.

248
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,470
So all of these molecules, they
keep showing up in our

249
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,370
chemical pathways.

250
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,980
And that's interesting if you
find that type of thing

251
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,680
interesting.

252
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,290
But the important thing is,
they form oxaloacetate and

253
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,650
then oxaloacetate
gets converted.

254
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,970
Let me make it, I made
this not as neatly as

255
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,870
I would like to.

256
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,620
But then that gets converted to
either malate or aspartate

257
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,090
but these are all 4-carbon
molecules.

258
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,330
They're a little different;
they're going to have

259
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,050
different oxygens and hydrogens
hanging off of them.

260
00:11:51,050 --> 00:12:04,990
But this is either malate
or aspartate

261
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,210
Most books will just say, oh it
will eventually just form

262
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,940
into malate only.

263
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,740
And then this, this malate, will
then essentially react to

264
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,965
produce carbon dioxide.

265
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:19,730
And you're like, wait.

266
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,720
That doesn't make sense.

267
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
I have carbon dioxide, it gets
fixed on oxaloacetic acid and

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,610
then it gets turned into malate
or aspartate And then

269
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,350
later I'm going to turn into
carbon dioxide again.

270
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,610
What's the whole point?

271
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,070
And this is the key.

272
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,440
This is the whole crux
of the issue.

273
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,620
So now this malate is going to
be converted back into PEP and

274
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,370
carbon dioxide.

275
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,960
You're like, what was
the whole point

276
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,080
of this whole reaction?

277
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,380
I just ended up with carbon
dioxide and PEP again.

278
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,690
I'm just going in circles.

279
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,830
But the neat thing about this,
and the reason why this

280
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,540
prevents photorespiration is
that this part, this part of

281
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,030
the reaction right here-- maybe
I should do it like

282
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,630
this-- this part of the
reaction occurs in the

283
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,000
mesophyll cell.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,980
It occurs up here.

285
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,440
It occurs over here in
the mesophyll cell.

286
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,250
So you have this malate.

287
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,120
And then the malate actually
gets transferred into these

288
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,090
bundle-sheath cells.

289
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,090
So the malate gets transferred
into the bundle-sheath cells

290
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,340
via little tubes that connect
the cells called plasmodesmata

291
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,110
Sounds like the name
of a horror movie.

292
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,290
So let me draw this a
little bit neater.

293
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,080
So over here you have, with
exposure to the air, you have

294
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,910
your mesophyll cell.

295
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,240
Air is coming in, O2, CO2,
everything is coming in.

296
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,580
But only CO2 can be
fixed with PEP.

297
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,860
So you have the PEP here, the
phosphoenolpyruvate So you

298
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,810
have your Pep here.

299
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,880
Only CO2 can be reacted with
PEP because of the PEP

300
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,130
carboxylase.

301
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,990
   

302
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,490
This is the enzyme
that's operating.

303
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,570
So this is much more specific
than the ribulose bisphosphate

304
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,250
carboxylase, or the RuBisCo.

305
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,560
   

306
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
So the oxygen just
gets ignored.

307
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,810
Even though it's hanging around
these mesophyll cells.

308
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,950
And then these, this
gets converted.

309
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,500
Oxaloacetic acid.

310
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,720
And then to malate.

311
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,200
But once it gets converted to
malate, the malate gets

312
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,660
transferred deeper into the
actual cell via these

313
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,860
plasmodesmata So this might be
butting right up against

314
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,410
bundle-sheath cell, that's
deeper in the cell.

315
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,280
This bundle-sheath cell has
no access to oxygen.

316
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,180
So the malate comes in.

317
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,970
You have these little pipes
that connect the cell.

318
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,450
Maybe I'll just draw one pipe.

319
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,340
So let's say there's one pipe.

320
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,910
So the malate can come here.

321
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,040
And then, within this deeper
cell, within this

322
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,260
bundle-sheath cell, it can
then react to form carbon

323
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,600
dioxide and pyruvate.

324
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,146
And then the pyruvate--
so let's just

325
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,750
say this is the pyruvate.

326
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,040
That pyruvate can then later
go back to actually

327
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,170
form the PEP again.

328
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,920
So this can go back through
your plasmodesmata

329
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,810
and form the PEP.

330
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,880
So the whole value here is, now
in the bundle-sheath cell,

331
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,690
I have an environment that
only has carbon dioxide.

332
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,210
I have no oxygen here.

333
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,150
I was able to essentially
select for the

334
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,160
carbon dioxide outside.

335
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,090
Or closer to the air in
the mesophyll cell.

336
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,360
And now that I'm deeper within
the plant, I'm in an

337
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,520
environment that only has CO2,
because I've already

338
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,240
selected for it.

339
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,900
And now I can perform
the Calvin Cycle.

340
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,960
So now, inside this deeper
cell, inside this

341
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,940
bundle-sheath cell, I can fix
the carbon dioxide with the

342
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,410
ribulose bisphosphate using
RuBisCo, just like we learned

343
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,630
in the original Calvin Cycle.

344
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,560
And we have the whole cycle
and we produce our sugars.

345
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,670
We produce our
phosphoglyceraldehydees or our

346
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,350
PGALs, whatever you
want to call them.

347
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,930
And the whole value this is,
that we were able to avoid the

348
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,210
photorespiration problem.

349
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,760
Because now the Calvin Cycle is
occurring in an environment

350
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,640
that only has carbon dioxide.

351
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,580
And I think I already mentioned
it, but this is

352
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,050
called C-4 photosynthesis.

353
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,420
   

354
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,120
And it's an adaption to make
sure that you don't waste

355
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,045
cycles of your Calvin Cycle
through photorespiration.

356
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:41,130
And of course it was called C-4,
because the first time

357
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,350
that carbon gets fixed
it doesn't happen

358
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,390
in the Calvin Cycle.

359
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,440
It happens up here, with
PEP carboxylase.

360
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,060
And it gets fixed with PEP
into a 4-carbon chain.

361
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,730
And that's why it's called
C-4 photosynthesis.

362
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,216
