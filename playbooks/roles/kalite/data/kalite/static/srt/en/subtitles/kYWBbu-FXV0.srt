1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,250
We're on problem 107.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,550
Any decimal that has only a
finite number of non-zero

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,340
digits is a terminating
decimal.

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,360
For example, 24-- in the example
they give us-- 24,

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,620
0.82, and 5.096.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,570
So they're saying if you just
have a finite number of these

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,250
non-zero things, at some point
you have to end, and just have

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,350
zeroes just left over.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,680
So that's what they mean by
a terminating decimal.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:44,290
If r and s are positive
integers, and the ratio r

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:54,210
divided by s is expressed as a
decimal, is r divided by s a

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,460
terminating decimal?

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,010
   

15
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,880
So essentially it wouldn't
work if r and n--

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,910
that this is 1/3.

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,700
That's not going to work.

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,610
Because you'll have
0.3 forever.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,830
So they're saying, does
it at some point end?

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,900
This is interesting.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,740
So statement 1 tells us that
90 is less than r which is

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,040
less than 100.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,295
That statement by itself
doesn't help me.

24
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:32,550
Now let's say that r was--
let me think of a good r.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,230
Let's say r was 93.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,930
If r is equal to 93 and then s
is equal to-- well, let's just

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,290
say that s, for the sake of
argument, is 3 times r.

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,180
Actually, I don't have
to pick an r.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,520
Whatever r is, I can just pick
an s to be 3 times r.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,600
And I'm not going to get
a terminating decimal.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,590
On the other hand, if I pick
s to be 2 times r, then I'm

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,650
going to have a terminating
decimal.

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,325
So statement 1 by itself
isn't going to help me.

34
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,330
   

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,140
I hope you understand that.

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,850
I can pick any s to make
it terminating

37
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,360
or not at this point.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,310
No matter whether
r is constrained

39
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,330
between 90 and 100.

40
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,903
Statement 2 tells us that
s is equal to 4b.

41
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:28,330
   

42
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,820
Now, this is interesting
to me.

43
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,910
So where did this b come
from all of a sudden?

44
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,280
Any decimal that has only a
finite number of non-zero

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,990
digits is a terminating
decimal.

46
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,460
If r and s are integers and the
ratio s is equal to 4b.

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,610
Where did this come from?

48
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,660
Let me look it up.

49
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,400
What is this?

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,300
I think this is a typo.

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,080
Because where did b come
from all of a sudden?

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,940
Oh, yeah, when I look at
the solution they say

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,650
s is equal to 4.

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,900
So that's definitely a typo.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,320
4b.

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,180
s is equal to 4.

57
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,510
OK that makes a lot
more sense.

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,380
All right, so if s
is equal to 4.

59
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,670
Pretty much any number, when
you divide any number by 4,

60
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,350
you're going to have a
terminating decimal.

61
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,720
It's either going to be
divisible by 4 or it's going

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,750
to be-- the worst case, if you
have 1 divided by 4, that

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,390
equals 0.25.

64
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,750
5 So no matter what, when you
divide something by 4, you're

65
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,460
always going to have a
terminating decimal.

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,240
It's never going to
repeat forever.

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,560
I mean you can try it out with
every-- no matter what number

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,770
you divide, if you view it as
a fraction, or kind of your

69
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,600
fourth grade remainder problems,
the remainder is

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,920
either going to be 1, 2 or 3.

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,450
If the remainder is 1, the
decimal is going to be 0.25.

72
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,120
If the remainder is 2, the
decimal is going to be 0.5.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,080
And if the remainder is 3, the
decimal is going to be 0.75.

74
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,600
In any case, as long as
s equals 4, you have a

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,810
terminating decimal.

76
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,010
So statement 2 alone is
sufficient and statement 1

77
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,980
really doesn't tell us much.

78
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,600
And I'm annoyed that they
had that b typo there.

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,340
Next problem.

80
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,470
108.

81
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,850
OK, they've drawn a triangle
right there.

82
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,565
Let me see if I can
draw it properly.

83
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:30,980
   

84
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,800
There you go.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,600
And let me label it.

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,660
This is B.

87
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,550
That's A.

88
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,490
That's C.

89
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,460
This is y degrees.

90
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,030
And this is D and this
is x degrees.

91
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,140
In the figure above, what is
the value of x plus y?

92
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,970
So x degrees plus y degrees.

93
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,850
x plus y is equal to what?

94
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,470
   

95
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,480
So they don't tell
us anything else.

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,050
They don't tell us if this is
an equilateral triangle.

97
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,320
They don't tell us that these
angles are equal.

98
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,230
They don't tell us
it's symmetrical.

99
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,640
They don't tell us anything
about this triangle so far.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,570
So statement number 1 tells
us that x is equal to 70.

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,710
Well, just by x equalling 70,
that still doesn't help me.

102
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,640
I still don't know
what y can be.

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,390
I mean, you could draw this
interior triangle in a bunch

104
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,950
of different ways and you could
see that the angle could

105
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,820
change depending on how much you
lift up D or compress D.

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,350
This y angle can change
irrespective of what x is.

107
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,220
So x is equal to 70 does not
in any way give me any

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,980
information on what y is.

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,090
Statement 2.

110
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:50,050
Triangle ABC and triangle
ADC are both isosceles.

111
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:57,310
So isosceles actually doesn't
mean necessarily that those

112
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,650
two sides are the same.

113
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,940
I mean, that kind of tends
to be someone's immediate

114
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,030
assumption, when we
say isosceles.

115
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh maybe that side is
equal to that side.

116
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,980
But no, it just means that two
of the sides are the same.

117
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,120
So, likewise on this triangle.

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,150
Although you can, at least,
here-- can I make an argument?

119
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,630
No, you can't make an argument
which two sides are going to

120
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,490
be the same.

121
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,430
So, even if you assumed that
both of those sides are the

122
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,710
same, you're still not going
to-- because you don't know.

123
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,445
My gut instinct would be to say,
oh, that side's the same

124
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:29,020
as that side.

125
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,030
But no, I can't make
that assumption.

126
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,980
Because it could be that this
side is equal to that side.

127
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,090
That would still make
it isosceles.

128
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,690
And this side is kind of viewed
as like the base side.

129
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,140
And it's a very big
difference.

130
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,300
Because if these are the two
equal sides, and if this is x,

131
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,050
this is going to be x.

132
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,060
But then if I take the other
scenario, where if these are

133
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,720
two sides and if this is x, then
both of these are really

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,490
be 180 minus x divided
by 2, right?

135
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,720
Because this would be-- The
bottom line is, this still

136
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,460
doesn't get me anywhere.

137
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,600
Even if I know that this
is 70 degrees.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,120
So I'm going to go with, E,
not enough information to

139
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,470
solve this problem.

140
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,950
109.

141
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,385
Are positive integers p and
q both greater than n?

142
00:07:14,385 --> 00:07:18,560
   

143
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,030
They told us positive
integers.

144
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,460
OK.

145
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,290
They say p minus q is
greater than n.

146
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,650
   

147
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,710
Well I'll give you a case right
now where that doesn't

148
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,420
satisfy this.

149
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:41,480
What if p is equal to 10,
q is equal to 1, and

150
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,610
n is equal to 2.

151
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,540
Then 10 minus 1 is 9 is
definitely greater than 2.

152
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,990
But look, q is not
greater than 2.

153
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,270
1 is not greater than 2.

154
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,700
So q wouldn't be
greater than n.

155
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,760
Or I could say, it could
be, 110 and 108.

156
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,420
Would equal-- and when you
subtracted you'd get 2.

157
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,100
And in this case q
is bigger than 2.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,130
So this doesn't give me
enough information.

159
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,800
I can think of two combinations

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,150
of p's q's and n's.

161
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,110
One that says that q is not
greater than n and one that

162
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,150
says that q is greater than n.

163
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,200
So one, by itself,
isn't enough.

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,450
Statement 2.

165
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,310
   

166
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,465
q is greater than p.

167
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:33,000
   

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,409
That still doesn't help me.

169
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,799
Both of these statement actually
cannot be true

170
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,549
simultaneously.

171
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,299
Because if these are both
positive integers, which they

172
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:49,640
told us-- well, greater
than n.

173
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,510
Both greater than n.

174
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,190
They didn't tell us

175
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,770
necessarily that n is positive.

176
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,200
So n doesn't have
to be positive.

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,590
My logic for statement
1 still holds.

178
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:05,660
But let's see, if q is greater
than p, this by itself doesn't

179
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,210
help me much.

180
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,050
Because I can think of a similar
combination to this.

181
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:17,130
I can say q is equal to 10, p
is equal to 9, and I could

182
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,970
make n is equal to 2.

183
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,680
Or I could say n
is equal to 15.

184
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,780
This in no way constrains
what n is.

185
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,540
So it, by itself, doesn't
solve it.

186
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,280
But what if we were to
use both constraints.

187
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,520
This is the interesting case.

188
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,500
What if we were to say that p
minus q is greater than n.

189
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,430
And q is greater than p.

190
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,520
So, we know that both p
and q are positive.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,420
They told us that in the
problem statement.

192
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:55,620
If p and q are both positive,
and q is greater than p, this

193
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,780
is going to end up becoming
a negative number.

194
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,000
These are both positive.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
And this is the larger of the
two positive numbers based on

196
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,110
the second constraint.

197
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,500
So this is going to be
a negative number.

198
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,050
And so if a negative number is
greater than n, then we can be

199
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,810
sure, we can be positive,
that both p and q are

200
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,530
greater than n.

201
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,700
Because they told us that
p and q are positive.

202
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,620
So actually both of
these statements

203
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,310
imply that n is negative.

204
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,700
Because we have a negative
number here being

205
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,880
greater than n.

206
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,460
And if n is negative, then both
p and q are definitely

207
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,410
greater than n.

208
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,520
So both statements combined
are sufficient

209
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,640
to answer this question.

210
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,760
And the answer is
actually true.

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll see you in the
next video.
