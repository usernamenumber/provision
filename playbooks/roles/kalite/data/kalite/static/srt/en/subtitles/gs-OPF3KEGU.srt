Thrill Soda hired a marketing company to help them promote their brand against Yummy Cola.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The company gathered the following data about consumers' preference of soda:

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they have, year by year, percentage of respondants who preferred Yummy Cola,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
percentage of respondants who preferred Thrill Cola,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and these are people who had no preference.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, in 2006, 80% liked Yummy, only 12% liked Thrill, and 8% didn't like either one or

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
didn't have any preference.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so actually just from here you see that many many more people liked Yummy Cola

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than Thrill Cola, actually every year over year.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, Thrill Cola definitely has something -- they have an uphill battle.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then they said the advertising company created the following two graphs to promote Thrill Soda.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so, let's see what's happening over here.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's think whether this is misleading or not.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we look at this graph over here, in 2006, sure enough, 80% liked Yummy Cola, then in 2007, 76%, a
