1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,050
We're asked to solve for x.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,340
So we have the square root of
the entire quantity 5x squared

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,360
minus 8 is equal to 2x.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,830
Now we already have an
expression under a radical

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,860
isolated, so the easiest first
step here is really just to

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,500
square both sides of
this equation.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,650
So let's just square both
sides of that equation.

9
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,950
Now the left-hand side, if you
square it, the square root of

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,060
5x squared minus 8 squared
is going to be 5x

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,590
squared minus 8.

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,960
This is 5x squared minus 8.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,220
And then the right-hand side,
2x squared is the same thing

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,530
as 2 squared times x squared
or 4x squared.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,060
Now we have a quadratic.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,590
Now let's see what we can do
to maybe simplify this a

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,230
little bit more.

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,345
Well, we could subtract
4x squared.

19
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:51,130
Or actually, even better, let's
subtract 5x squared from

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,480
both sides so that we just have
all our x terms on the

21
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,780
right-hand side.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,000
So let's subtract 5x squared
from both sides.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Subtract 5x squared from both
sides of the equation.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,180
The left-hand side,
this cancels out.

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,980
That was the whole point.

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,990
We're just left with negative 8
is equal to 4x squared minus

27
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,915
5x squared, that's negative
1x squared.

28
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:16,740
Or we could just write
negative x

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,040
squared, just like that.

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,590
And then we could multiply both
sides of this equation by

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,880
negative 1.

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
That'll make it into
positive 8.

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,800
Or I could divide by negative
1, however you

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,330
want to view it.

35
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,900
Negative 1 times that
times negative 1.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,510
So we get positive 8 is
equal to x squared.

37
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,110
And now we could take the square
root of both sides of

38
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,360
this equation.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,760
So let's take the square
root of both

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,860
sides of this equation.

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,200
The principal square root of
both sides of this equation.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
And what do we get?

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,240
We get, on the right-hand
side, x is equal to the

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,670
square root of 8.

45
00:01:52,670 --> 00:02:00,270
And 8 can be rewritten
as 2 times 4.

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,350
And this can be rewritten as the
square root of 2 times the

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,460
square root of 4
is equal to x.

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,470
I don't like this green
color so much.

49
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,530
And what's the square root of
4, the principal root of 4?

50
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,500
It's 2.

51
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,270
So that right there is 2.

52
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,300
So this side becomes 2, this 2,
times the square root of 2.

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,850
And that is equal to x.

54
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,970
Now let's verify that this
is the solution to

55
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,350
our original equation.

56
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,260
So let's substitute this in,
first to the left-hand side.

57
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,270
So on the left-hand side, we
have 5 times 2 square roots of

58
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,860
2 squared minus 8.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,320
And then we're going to have
to take the square root of

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,100
that whole thing.

61
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,880
So this is going to be equal
to-- we're just focused on the

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,430
left-hand side right now.

63
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:55,390
This is equal to the square
root of 5 times 2 squared,

64
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,810
which is 4, times the square
root of 2 squared, which is 2.

65
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,190
And then minus 8.

66
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:08,100
And this is 5 times 4
is 20 times 2 is 40.

67
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,760
And then you have 40
minus 8 is 32.

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,000
So this is equal to the
square root of 32.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,723
Square root of 32 is the same
thing as the square

70
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,480
root of 16 times 2.

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,205
The square root of 16 is 4.

72
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,680
So this is the same thing as
the square root of 16 times

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
the square root of 2.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,670
Or 4 square roots of 2.

75
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,750
So that's what the left hand
simplifies to when we-- and

76
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,400
remember, the original equation
didn't have these

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,770
squares here, so if you just
look at the green part, the

78
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,590
green part on the left-hand
side just simplified to 4

79
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,650
roots of 2.

80
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,700
Let's see what 2x
simplifies to.

81
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,570
Our original right-hand
side was just the 2x.

82
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,360
That's parentheses with the
square added later.

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,790
So what's 2x?

84
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,620
2 times 2 roots of 2.

85
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,270
2 square root of 2.

86
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,660
Well that's just 4
square root of 2.

87
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,370
So when x is equal to 2 square
roots of 2, the left-hand side

88
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,425
equals 4 square roots of 2.

89
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,380
And remember, the left-hand side
looked like this when we

90
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,500
started off.

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,140
The left-hand side when
we started off

92
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,930
didn't have that there.

93
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,220
I want to make that clear.

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,980
So when you substitute this back
into this left-hand side,

95
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,370
you get 4 square roots of 2.

96
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,510
When you substitute it back into
the original right-hand

97
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,970
side, you get 4 square
roots of 2.

98
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,450
So it's definitely the right--
I'm trying to write in black.

99
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,149
It's definitely the
right solution.

100
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,266
