1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:03,947
When you look at a footage or photographs of astronauts in space,

2
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:07,430
it doesn't look like there is any gravity at work here.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,678
everything is not falling down in one direction -- In fact it's not even clear what up or down is.

4
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,118
everything just floats around...

5
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,115
If I were to push off of this wall,

6
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:17,786
I'll just float in that direction.

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:25,774
So, it doesn't look like there is this overarching influence like gravity that is trying to pull everything down.

8
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:33,019
But the question is that these astronauts are still not too far away from a super massive body.

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:39,427
In fact the space shuttle gets up only a couple of hundred miles above the surface of the earth.

10
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:43,607
So the space shuttle, if I was to draw it to scale, would probably be right about there.

11
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:48,920
And we know, we know that the force of gravity between two objects is equal to

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:01:00,400
big G, the gravitational constant times the mass of the first object, times the mass of the second object, over the distant between the two objects squared--

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,415
And if the space shuttle is right here

14
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:06,133
only a few hundred miles above the surface of the earth,

15
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:11,984
This "r" isn't that different. It's a little further than if you were at the surface of the earth.

16
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:17,800
Remember that "r" is measured from wherever you are, to the center of the earth.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,453
Or really "r" is the center of object to the center of earth. The center of the earth represents most of the distance here.

18
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:28,050
So, if I am at surface of earth,or if I am at just the few hundred miles above the surface of the earth

19
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:33,298
It's not going to change "r" that dramatically especially in turns of the percentage

20
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:34,800
So when you look at this way

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,124
it's seems pretty clear that the force of gravity for someone who is in space

22
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:48,623
only a few hundred mile above the earth should not be that different than the force of the gravity for someone who is on the surface of the earth.

23
00:01:48,623 --> 00:01:51,456
So my question to you is what gives?

24
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:58,000
If there should be gravity in space, how can we all these pictures of people floating around like this.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,016
And the answer is,is that there is gravity in space, and these people actually are falling

26
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:10,125
they are just moving fast enough relative to the earth that they keep missing it.

27
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,029
Let me show you what I am talking about there.

28
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:16,142
So if I would take a, if I would,if I would

29
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:19,318
let's see,I'm sitting here in Africa,and I would shoot something

30
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:26,379
Maybe I have really good slingshot and I would sling something super fast at maybe a 45 degree angle.

31
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,800
It might take off a little bit and eventually hit another point.

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,369
and this is what I actually already be a super doppler slingshot.

33
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:36,085
I just made travel a couple of thousands miles,at least over a thousand miles.

34
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:40,682
If I make it go a little bit faster, if i put a little bit more force on

35
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:45,373
if I just propell the projectile a little bit faster and might go litttle bit further.

36
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,091
But it will eventually fall back to the earth.

37
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:49,691
Let's try to propell it a little bit faster than that.

38
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,385
Then it will still fall the earth.

39
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:58,097
Let's propell it even faster than that,well, then it's still eventually going to fall to the earth.

40
00:02:58,097 --> 00:02:59,788
I think you might see where this is going.

41
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,200
Let's go even faster than that.

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,363
So if we go even faster than that,eventually it will fall to the earth,even faster than that.

43
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:14,351
So if you, if you are throwing an object even faster than that,it would then go really far and then fall the earth.

44
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,698
I think you see what's happening.

45
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:21,467
Every time, you go faster and faster, you throw this projectile out faster and faster, gets further and further

46
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:29,998
To some velocity that you release this projectile,and every time,whenever it's trying to fall to the earth

47
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:33,438
it’s going so fast that it keeps missing the earth.

48
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:40,341
So it will keep going around and around and around the earth. And a projectile like that would be in Orbit.

49
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:51,644
So what happened is if there is no gravity for that projectile, if there is no gravity the projectile would just go straight away into the space.

50
00:03:51,644 --> 00:04:02,079
But because there is gravity it is constantly pulling it towards the center of the earth or the center of that projectile and the center of the earth would be pulled towards each other.

51
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,471
I guess it’s a better way to think about it.

52
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:15,395
The force gravity is doing that. And so its curving its path and if it’s going fast enough if the projectile whatever object we are talking about, it will just keep going around and around the earth

53
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:27,748
And since there is almost pretty much for most of the surface, there is no air at if you go high enough especially like the space shuttle, like is no noticeable drag.

54
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:31,469
This thing can just keep on going for a substantial amount of time.

55
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:44,544
Although there is just a little bit drag, that’s why over time you do have satellites slow down. Because there is just a little bit air resistance, so the answer to this conundrum (difficult problem or question) is that there actually is gravity

56
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:54,115
It’s not a gravity free environment, it’s just that the astronauts and space shuttle and everything else that’s in the space shuttle is all falling

57
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:58,802
but it’s moving fast enough that it never hits the earth. It keeps missing the earth.

58
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,854
it keeps going around and around and around.

59
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:04,467
But, it is completely under the influence of the gravity

60
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:10,698
if they were to just slow themselves down, if they were to just brake relative to the earth

61
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:17,982
and if they were to just, you know, they put their brakes on right over there, they would all just plumit to the earth

62
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:24,515
and there is nothing special about going three or four hundred miles up into space that all of the sudden the gravity disappears.

63
00:05:24,515 --> 00:05:27,818
The influence of gravity actually on some level just keeps going. You can’t.

64
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:35,885
It might become noticeably small on some points but definitely only couples of hundreds miles up to the air, there is definitely gravity there.

65
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:40,952
It’s just their in Orbit, they are going fast enough so if they just keep falling. They are never going to hit the earth.

66
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:51,802
And if you want to simulate gravity and this is actually how NASA does the simulate gravity is that they would put people in the plane they called it the "Vomit Rocket" because it is known to make people sick.

67
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:59,218
And they’ll make them go into a projectile motion. So if this is the ground in a projectile path or in a parabolic path, I should say.

68
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:09,793
So the plane will take off and it will do a path exactly the same as something in free fall or in a parabolic path.

69
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:13,283
So anyone who is sitting in that plane will experience free fall.

70
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:20,167
So if you ever be in, if you ever you know right when you jump off, if you have ever bungee jumped or sky dived or

71
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:28,369
Hum… even the feeling when a roller coster is going right over the top and it’s pulling you down and your stomach feels a little ill that feeling of free fall.

72
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:33,856
That's the exact same feeling that these astronauts’ feel because they are in a constant state of free fall.

73
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:43,338
But that is an indistinguishable feeling from if you were just in deep space and you weren't anywhere close to any noticeable mass

74
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:50,387
that is an identical feeling that you would feel to having no gravitational force around you.

75
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:57,854
So hopefully that clarifies things a little bit? To someone whos just sitting in the space shuttle and if they have no windows, there is no way of them knowing

76
00:06:57,854 --> 00:07:02,582
whether they are close to a mass of object or they are just in free fall around it, they are in orbit or

77
00:07:02,659 --> 99:59:59,999
whether they are just completely far away from any mass of object and they really are in the state of, or in a place where there is very little gravity.
