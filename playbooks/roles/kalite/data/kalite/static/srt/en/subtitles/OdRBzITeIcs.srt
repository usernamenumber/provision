2
00:00:05,544 --> 00:00:13,547
Pippa Couch: We're in the British Museum and we're looking at the Black George icon which is from about 1400 to 1450

3
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,843
Rachel Ropeik: So this is a Russian icon

4
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:20,074
and you can see there is a bit of Cyrillic writing up there saying "George"--who this is

5
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:22,281
--and there are lots of images of St. George around

6
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:27,011
--anytime you see images of a knight on horseback stabbing a dragon usually with a big long spear

7
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:31,013
--sometimes he's saving a princess--that's St. George but there's no princess here

8
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:35,858
Pippa: No it's more of a distilled version--also we're used to seeing him though in knights--metal armor

9
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:37,712
Rachel: And yet he doesn't look like a knight here

10
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:42,181
--he looks like he's just kind of wearing a nice little tunic and a very flowy cape and some nice bright red tights

11
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:44,292
Pippa: Yeah--there's nothing particularly that's going to protect him

12
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:49,245
Rachel: But what we do see because of that very neatly composed billowy red cape is his halo

13
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:52,459
--there are little bits of gold left on the circle around his head

14
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,363
--and that's how we know that he's not just any old man

15
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:58,291
riding through the country side killing a dragon like you do

16
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,703
--he's St. George

17
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:01,671
Pippa: And the fact that they put the cape flowing up like that

18
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:05,070
--that's definitely a purposeful compositional point that they want to highlight the halo--don't they

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,536
--and they draw attention to it--that cape drags your eye up to the halo and across to the name

20
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:12,299
--the inscription "George"

21
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,655
Rachel: Because sometimes we see icons with whole gold background

22
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:19,101
but we don't here because this wasn't a scene that took place in heaven

23
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:22,295
--illuminated by the light of heaven which is what the gold does

24
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:26,298
Pippa: And it's earthly--he's on ground--there's a horizon there which you would never normally see

25
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,163
Rachel: Now the other thing that I'm struck by is the big black horse

26
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:33,303
--it's called the "Black George Icon" and usually you think of George on white horse

27
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:37,088
Pippa: And that's interesting because again this is byzantine icon

28
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:43,299
and the white horse is often associated with crusader art so it's often with Western ideas of St. George

29
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,285
--and don't forget that the Crusades came through--they stayed in Constantine for a bit

30
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:51,468
--and they said, "We're going to go on and fight in the Holy Land," but they were very jealous of everything Constantinople had

31
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:55,321
and while they were there were like, "While we're here we're just going to sack and take everything."

32
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,945
--and they ruled there for 50 years so if the West associated St. George with a white horse

33
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:05,751
and crusader triumpant sort of attitude--the byzantine world obviously doesn't see that in that same way

34
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,869
--it's very unusual though--there are a few more in existence

35
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:10,261
but they are very very rare

36
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:15,091
Rachel: Your eye is kind of drawn down there's this long thin diagonal red line of George's spear

37
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:23,681
--it doesn't really look very strong--it's modern St. George killing the dragon with a laser

38
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:28,071
--but there is that dragon and it kind of looks like a big snake all coiled up down at the bottom

39
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,939
Pippa: It's definitely coiled up on itself--looks like it's knotted around it's tail

40
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,970
--almost going to eat it's own tail there--struggling

41
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,234
--but the moment of death hasn't happened yet--has it?

42
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:39,105
--he's frozen in that moment of just about to impale him--just about to succeed

43
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,620
--and it's interesting because often in Western art they are commenting about George

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,703
as the knight in the armor and the clothes

45
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:47,388
--and he's physical--his personal ability to overcome the dragon

46
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:52,813
--and in byzantine art they're saying, "George is good and that the dragon is evil"

47
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:55,764
--and it's this continual struggle that we're all having all the time

48
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:58,338
of trying to overcome falsehood and evil

49
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:02,612
--so he would never have actually had a dead dragon at his feet because that would mean "it's finished--we're done"

50
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:04,998
--but it's not--it's an eternal struggle for all of humankind

51
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:09,588
Rachel: Because he's of course put that dragon almost completely buried in the lower register

52
00:03:09,588 --> 00:03:12,434
below that line of the landscape horizon that you see

53
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:18,620
--and George and the horse with the exception a couple of feet is totally above in the realm of the sky

54
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,566
Pippa: Emphasizing upper realm--upper register and the earthly temporality of the dragon on the bottom

55
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:28,466
--and the horse is extremely elegant--those lines and the legs that are splayed out

56
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:33,159
in such a beautiful way and it really fills the icon of George from left to right

57
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:40,939
--this icon actually has a very interesting story because it was found being used as a shutter on a barn in a village in northern Russia

58
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,559
--and it was actually a different painting at the time--it had some 18th century painting on top

59
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,707
--and they took that off and found a 17th century painting underneath

60
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:52,795
--and they cleaned it again--and were like "WHHAAAOO look we've got this 1400 St. George"

61
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:56,288
--and so we're really really lucky to have this here to marvel over today

62
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,985
--the continual struggle that George is doing and that we are doing

63
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:15,600
