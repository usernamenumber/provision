[music]

2
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:07,902
As with many triptychs, viewers could see the exterior -

3
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,805
the closed triptych - during the weekdays;

4
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:13,271
and on feast days, or on the weekends,

5
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:15,050
the painting would be opened up.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,509
You would move from the rather prosaic expressions of our world

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:24,539
to a brilliantly colored scene of the horrors of Limbo,

8
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,270
and the horrors of Hell.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,960
We see a saint on each wing,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,217
and these are painted in grisaille, in tones of gray,

11
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:35,048
so it really would have been amazing

12
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:38,248
when it opened to this colorful vision.

13
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:40,606
The idea of painting the exterior in grisaille

14
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:44,045
was meant to mimic the exterior that is the stone of the church,

15
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,141
but here the artist has moved far beyond that earlier tradition;

16
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,808
and he's actually not painting niches and sculptures,

17
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:54,806
but actual people, a city and a landscape.

18
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:58,170
So here in grisaille on one side, we see Saint Bavo,

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,330
who was associated with the northern city of Ghent;

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,607
he's shown distributing alms to the sick and the poor,

21
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:08,543
through a doorway a view of a Flemish city.

22
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:10,967
Showing the wonderful detail of that cityscape.

23
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,634
Let's walk around to the other side and take a look at St. James.

24
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:18,167
You can see, he's traveled past all kinds of expressions of wickedness.

25
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,880
His faith, however, has kept him safe.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,169
And he's very much associated with pilgrimage.

27
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:28,157
It is his pilgrimage that so many medieval faithful would follow.

28
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:31,383
These wings could have given us clues

29
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,539
to the patron of this very large triptych,

30
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,830
but unfortunately the coat of arms is blank.

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,046
We don't know why,

32
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,441
but some art historians have suggested that perhaps

33
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:45,046
the donor may have died before the work was finished.

34
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:46,118
Let's look inside.

35
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,637
The image, in a sense, unfolds as a kind of story.

36
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:53,205
Beginning in the left wing, we see God in Heaven.

37
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:56,714
He is in majesty, in a kind of brilliant mandorla,

38
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:58,222
surrounded by clouds.

39
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,962
But when you look more closely,

40
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:02,456
you see that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands

41
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,437
of angels that seem to be battling each other.

42
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:07,463
This is the Fall of the Rebel Angels.

43
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,975
This is a rebellion of angels led by Lucifer,

44
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:11,966
the Devil.

45
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,341
And they will be expelled from Heaven, of course,

46
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:15,875
will go to reside in Hell.

47
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,383
And down at the very foot of the panel,

48
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:23,241
we can see God extracting Eve from Adam's side.

49
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,002
That is the last part of the Creation of Adam and Eve.

50
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:29,833
Just above that, we have the Temptation.

51
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,861
There is a sense of peace in the foreground.

52
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,140
But this act of defiance against God's Law

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,650
is an important breaking point.

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,636
Because you can see that beyond that original sin,

55
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,032
you have one animal eating another

56
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,886
instead of living in harmony.

57
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,886
And then you have an avenging angel

58
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:50,637
who's expelling Adam and Eve from Paradise

59
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,553
and leading them into the world that we know.

60
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:57,507
We have an unfolding of events at the top,

61
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:00,390
beginning with God and the Fall of the Rebel Angels,

62
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,131
the event that happens first,

63
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,961
then we jump down to the bottom,

64
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:07,143
and the creation of Eve; then just above that,

65
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,480
the Temptation; and above that,

66
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,871
the Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.

67
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:15,553
And of course, this is the origin of original sin.

68
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:17,970
And after the expulsion of Adam and Eve

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,842
from the Garden of Eden,

70
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:22,603
mankind knows sin and temptation and death.

71
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,388
These stories echo each other.

72
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:27,283
You have Lucifer disobeying God,

73
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,637
You have Adam and Eve disobeying God,

74
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:32,109
You have Lucifer being expelled from Heaven,

75
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,885
and you have Man being expelled from the Garden.

76
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:36,305
And so there is this parallel

77
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:38,718
of the heavenly and the earthly.

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,710
And what Bosch is really concerned with

79
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,640
are the wages of sin.

80
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,724
This is what Bosch was famous for, even in his time.

81
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:50,575
This deeply pessimistic philosophy, this questioning:

82
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:50,634
   

83
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:53,948
Is there any possibility of redemption,

84
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,679
given the sins of the world?

85
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:57,459
It certainly doesn't seem that way.

86
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:59,310
Well, let's take a look at the evidence that he offers.

87
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,609
Okay, so we're moving to the central panel.

88
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,372
At the top we see Christ, functioning as judge.

89
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:08,117
We see angels with long golden trumpets

90
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,389
who are announcing the end of time.

91
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,993
And below it, taking up most of the central panel,

92
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:17,431
is Limbo, or the edges of Hell.

93
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,274
And this is a scene that Bosch has combined

94
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:22,391
with images of the seven deadly sins,

95
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:27,114
the sins that cause Mankind to spend eternity in Hell.

96
00:04:27,114 --> 00:04:29,475
This is a painting whose bottom two thirds

97
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:33,308
is filled with torture and the terrible crimes

98
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,383
that people inflict upon each other,

99
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:38,557
but here enacted by devils and composite creatures

100
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:40,377
that are incredibly fantastic.

101
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:42,724
The punishments that we see here

102
00:04:42,724 --> 00:04:45,611
are punishments for specific crimes,

103
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,140
and the punishments are related to the crimes.

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,608
Let's take a look at a few specifics.

105
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,304
On the left side,

106
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,352
we see something that resembles an inn;

107
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:58,010
on the roof, a figure who seems remarkably oblivious

108
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,880
to everything that's going on.

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,279
She walks as though she's on a fashion runway.

110
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,778
But surrounding her and biting her

111
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:06,660
is a hideous insect,

112
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,903
and she's led by a hideous dragon.

113
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,655
Led to a kind of hellish brothel.

114
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:16,473
And all accompanied by a lute played by another demon,

115
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:20,267
as well as a horn played by a demon in the back,

116
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,726
where the horn actually looks as if

117
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:23,539
it's an extension of his nose.

118
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,767
Bosch uses music as one vehicle for sinfulness,

119
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,564
a kind of sign of indulgence in pleasure.

120
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,138
Below the representation of Pride, or Vanity,

121
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:37,141
you have the sins of Gluttony.

122
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:39,370
You see a rather overweight man

123
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,155
who's having liquid forcibly poured into him

124
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,971
as he's restrained by devils.

125
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:45,524
And it's not a very nice liquid.

126
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,996
No. if you look a little bit above that barrel,

127
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,888
you can see that there's a siphon that's receiving

128
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:53,556
the excrement of a devil, whose backside

129
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:56,221
can just be seen through the gated window.

130
00:05:56,221 --> 00:06:00,331
Below that, you see one large demonic fish

131
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,677
devouring another, which seems to be a reference

132
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:04,218
to a northern proverb:

133
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:06,059
"The big fish eats the little."

134
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:09,689
That we take advantage of those who are

135
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,561
smaller and weaker and less powerful than we are.

136
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,313
To the right of that, we can see just inside the inn

137
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:18,415
a series of hanging figures;

138
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,898
and below that, a large cauldron

139
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,387
with a series of figures that seem to be boiling.

140
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:27,110
And we know that they're boiling in molten metal,

141
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,772
the metal that had been melted from their money.

142
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,723
So this is the sin of Avarice, or Greed.

143
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:37,304
There are endless representations of pain and suffering.

144
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,433
You see men being roasted or fried

145
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,162
by demonic frogs.

146
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:45,029
You see in one case, a frying pan

147
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,435
with pieces of a body.

148
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:48,399
But this froglike figure seems ready

149
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,559
to take her two eggs that sit beside her

150
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,175
and crack those into the pan as well.

151
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:54,141
And make a yummy omelet.

152
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:56,775
I think that what's so disturbing here

153
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:00,813
is the everyday-ness of the devilish figures

154
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,426
who torture the human beings.

155
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:05,574
They're just going about their roasting and cooking and frying,

156
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:08,561
and torturing, as though it were a normal,

157
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,063
everyday activity; and it reminds us that

158
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,874
Hell is eternity.

159
00:07:12,874 --> 00:07:14,474
In the middle of the large panel,

160
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:17,394
you can see the sin of Anger.

161
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,365
And it's represented by three knights

162
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,941
who are particularly awful.

163
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,388
There's one knight in the middle

164
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:26,775
who has upon his helmet a severed, blinded head.

165
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,390
Below that, you see images of corruption,

166
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,407
and scattered throughout the foreground

167
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:35,006
you see images of bodies that have been mutilated,

168
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,339
that have been shot with arrows,

169
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,879
bodies have been cut and wounded and devoured

170
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,281
in various ways.

171
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,668
And all of this, of course,

172
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:44,311
is a lead-in to the right panel,

173
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,511
to Hell itself.

174
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,524
When we think about the triptych as a whole,

175
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:50,273
we have God in the upper left,

176
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:53,236
and Satan diagonally across on the lower right.

177
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:56,736
Lucifer here sits in a kind of mock judgment

178
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:59,661
of the souls that have been found to have been sinful;

179
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,205
and here, he is meting out the terrible punishments

180
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,894
according to their crimes in life.

181
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:07,152
And you can see in the doorway behind him

182
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:10,144
images of toads, which often torture figures,

183
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,724
and images of the Last Judgment;

184
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,660
and then above, on the roof,

185
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,036
all of the damned in Hell,

186
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:19,064
who've recognized where they're spending eternity,

187
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,230
who are wailing and crying and flailing their arms.

188
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,185
And will populate the city of Hell,

189
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,213
which we see rising above this image.

190
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,747
It is a place of fire and brimstone.

191
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:32,563
It is a place of ruined cities, of absolute neglect.

192
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:35,639
It is an apocalyptic scene, most horrible.

193
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,797
And if this didn't make you want to live a virtuous life,

194
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:40,398
I don't know what would.

195
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:49,957
