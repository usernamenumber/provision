1
00:00:00,039 --> 00:00:04,861
[music playing]

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:11,962
We're in Santa Maria Novella, and we're looking at the left wall of the nave, inside the left aisle.

3
00:00:11,962 --> 00:00:15,713
About midway down is Masaccio's "The Holy Trinity."

4
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:20,717
This is a painintg that is often credited as being the earliest known example

5
00:00:21,656 --> 00:00:24,722
of true, scientific, one-point linear perspective.

6
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,823
Right. Which had only been discovered by Brunelleschi a few years earlier.

7
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:30,708
So it's really exciting to see it.

8
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:35,373
It is. And it is an incredibly realistic illusion of space.

9
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:40,260
And these days instead of entering from the front door of the church, you enter through the cloister,

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,793
and this fresco is directly opposite the entrance.

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:48,811
It really looks as though this is an actual space and not just an illusion.

12
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:53,143
It's funny to think that many wealthy families commissioned an actual chapel.

13
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:57,644
In this case, it is a more modest commission, which is the illusion of a chapel.

14
00:00:57,644 --> 00:01:01,557
Let's talk a little bit about what's being represented, what's actually going on here.

15
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:09,007
Well down the center of the fresco we see the Holy Trinity, and by "Holy Trinity" we mean the three-part nature of God.

16
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:10,758
As understood in the Catholic tradition.

17
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:12,972
At the top we have God the Father,

18
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,438
Below in the form of a dove we have the Holy Spirit.

19
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:18,254
Now that's a little hard to see.

20
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:22,368
And I think that sometimes people mistake that white as a kind of collar.

21
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:23,986
Yeah, it looks a little like God's collar.

22
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,903
But if you look very closely you do see there are two wings, a tail, and the head of a bird.

23
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:31,164
And the head of the bird is actually looking down towards Christ.

24
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,364
And also has a halo.

25
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:34,248
That's right. It has little radiating gold.

26
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:38,232
And so below the dove, which is the Holy Spirit, we see Christ on the cross.

27
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:41,031
We have the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

28
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:47,548
Now this is an extraordinary rendering of the human body pulled and tortured and really effected by gravity.

29
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:51,848
This is so far from the medieval treatment of the human body.

30
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:57,181
It's hard to imagine Masaccio could have painted this without actually stringing someone up on a cross

31
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:03,435
so he could observe what happened to the muscles of the body and the way that they would be pulled

32
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:04,537
in this position.

33
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:09,434
It creates such a great sense of sympathy, at least in me, and I think in many viewers,

34
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:11,453
to see the hollow of the abdomen.

35
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:16,468
Christ is bleeding. His pain feels real and emotional in a way that feels very direct.

36
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:23,486
And it is such a great illustration of the way in which the early Renaissance is able to marry deep faithfulness

37
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:25,705
with scientific observation.

38
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:30,018
So the other figures in the sacred space within the room that is depicted

39
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,618
are Mary in the dark cloak.

40
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:36,985
She's presenting her son to us, and I'm not sure that I can remember a more mournful Virgin Mary.

41
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:43,468
She's pointing up at Christ, showing us that Christ is the path to salvation.

42
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:45,785
And on the opposite side we see St. John.

43
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:50,466
Mary and St. John are the two figures that we often see in images of the Crucifixition.

44
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,883
This isn't a narrative of the story of the Crucifixion, but rather a devotional image,

45
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,814
an image that would be an aid to prayer.

46
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:02,882
So the figures on the outside of the sacred space in a peripheral position kneeling,

47
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:08,948
looking in and witnessing, as we're looking in and witnessing, are the donors.

48
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:15,781
But there's even more to this painting because below those steps is a representation of a tomb

49
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,415
that's been exposed, that's been opened for us.

50
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:24,631
And on that sarcophagus we see a skeleton, and an inscription in Latin.

51
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:32,731
And in rough translation would read:

52
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:39,931
So the message is that death is inevitable, that the skeleton is what we all will be,

53
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:43,680
and what the skeleton was, was us alive.

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,079
It's a momento mori. It's a reminder of the imminence of our death.

55
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:53,730
Even though we walk in our day-to-day lives taking for granted our ability to wake up the next morning.

56
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,632
And at a time when we can't predict,

57
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,097
we will look like the skeleton.

58
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:03,196
I think there's a tendency in our modern era to think about this as a reminder of death

59
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:06,513
and therefore to live life to its fullest.

60
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:10,014
But I think in the 15th century the meaning was different.

61
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:15,892
It was a reminder of death, therefore, prepare now for your salvation.

62
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:18,624
So that you can have eternity in Heaven.

63
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:24,541
And the way to an eternal life in Heaven is indicated up above through Mary's gestures,

64
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:29,275
Through Christ's sacrifice on the cross for the sins of mankind.

65
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:32,174
Let's go back to the point that we made at the very beginning,

66
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,779
which is the innovation of the linear perspective here.

67
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:39,729
Because what Masaccio has done is create an incredibly convincing deep space.

68
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,346
Masaccio has created a very specific viewpoint for the viewer.

69
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:48,763
As we stand in front of the painting, we look up at the barrel vault.

70
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,445
It's a wonderful classical ceiling, isn't it?

71
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:55,736
It is. Well, the whole architecture that Masaccio created here

72
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:57,620
is based on the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.

73
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,709
We have a barrel vault with coffers.

74
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:05,097
It's so interesting. If you were thinking that you were just going to be tentatively exploiting this new technique

75
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,812
of linear perspective, you might want to do something straightforward like a nice tiled floor.

76
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,379
But he's really showing off here.

77
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,863
He's really showing off. He's showing off the architecture with the linear perspective.

78
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:20,278
He's showing off with the figures, embracing Humanism that's happening in Florence in the early 15th century.

79
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,795
So the architecture looked modern.

80
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:26,446
The figures looked incredibly believable because Masaccio is using modeling

81
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,242
to make the figures appear round and three dimensional.

82
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:32,219
And we can really see it in the drapery of the figures,

83
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:35,150
and in the body of Christ, articulating his muscles.

84
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:41,111
So the figures looked I think radically new and real, and the space looked radically new and real.

85
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:47,719
So he's creating this emphasis on the humanity of this experience, on the emotion of this experience,

86
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:50,773
on the lifelikeness and proportional accuracy of the bodies themselves.

87
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:56,688
And then, of course, he needs to have an accurate space within which to place those human figures.

88
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:59,424
And so he's giving us both.

89
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:05,263
His very convincing sense of mass, volume, and proportion, and anatomy, as well as emotion,

90
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:08,255
and then he's placing those figures in a space that makes sense to us.

91
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:11,617
And one of the things that art historians have sometimes asked is

92
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:16,717
why is linear perspective developing here in Florence in the 15th century?

93
00:06:16,717 --> 00:06:22,218
And there is so many answers to this, but one of the ways you might begin to sort of think about this

94
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:28,701
is that here we have a culture of trade where there really is a kind of mathematics

95
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,669
that underlies the economy of the city.

96
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:34,201
People are trained to be able to buy and sell.

97
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:37,050
They think about fractions. They think about space and volumes.

98
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,752
They think about commodities.

99
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:41,668
And so this is a very analytic and a very rational culture,

100
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,435
and in a sense art had to respond to that.

101
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:50,784
To follow that thought forward, what Masaccio has done is given us an interior that is rational,

102
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:55,201
that we could enter it, and from the information he's given us, even from this limited view,

103
00:06:55,201 --> 00:07:02,551
we could do a very accurate drawing and really determine its depth, its width, and its internal decoration.

104
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:09,252
Masaccio is doing in painting what Donatello has already done in sculptures, create figures who are

105
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,401
deeply human and real.

106
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:19,618
The Humanism that inspires this is something here in Florence that sculptors were able to respond to earlier

107
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:22,568
because they had the example of the ancient Greek and Roman sculpture.

108
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:29,268
So Donatello in sculpture is responding to this revival of interest in classical Greece and Rome.

109
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:37,635
And then we have Masaccio following not long after with a kind of illusionism that allows for the same sets of issues.

110
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:40,147
It's to a large extent Brunelleschi as well.

111
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:44,680
Some people suggested that Brunelleschi worked with Masaccio on the architectural setting.

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,731
We have Corinthian plasters, attached columns with Ionic capitals.

113
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,564
There's the coffered vaulting, the round arch.

114
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:58,931
The architecture that Masaccio represented here would have looked startingly modern, I think,

115
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,296
to anyone looking at it in the early 15th century.

116
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:06,081
It would have looked very different for example, than the architecture we see around us in this church.

117
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:10,547
So in Florence, in the 15th century, you have sculpture, you have architecture, you have painting,

118
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:21,092
all responding to this revival of interest in Humanism, this notion that man can observe, understand,

119
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,092
and to some extent control his world and that this is and can be in the service of God.
