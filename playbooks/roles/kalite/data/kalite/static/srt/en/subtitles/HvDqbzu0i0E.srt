1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's review a little bit of
everything we learned so far

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,310
and hopefully it'll make
everything fit together

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,870
a little bit better.

5
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,340
Then we'll do a bunch of
calculations with real numbers

6
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,430
and I think it'll really
hit the point home.

7
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,910
So, first of all if we're
dealing with a-- let me

8
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,570
actually write down, let
me make some columns.

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,820
So if we're dealing with--
let's see, we could call it the

10
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:25,160
concept and then we'll call it
whether we're dealing with

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:34,310
a population or a sample.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:38,280
So the first statistical
concept we came up with was the

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,080
notion of the mean or the
central tendency and we learned

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,800
of that was one way to measure
the average or central

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,570
tendency of a data set.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,090
The other ways were the
median and the mode.

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,630
But the mean tends to show up a
lot more, especially when we

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,050
start talking about variances
and, as we'll do in this video,

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,290
the standard deviation.

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,150
But the mean of a population we
learned-- we use the greek

21
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,380
letter Mu-- is equal to the sum
of each of the data points

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,640
in the population.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,395
That's an i.

24
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:10,250
Let me make sure it
looks like an I.

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,170
So you're going to sum up
each of those data points.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,050
You're going to start with the
first one and you're going

27
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,200
to go to the nth one.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,880
We're assuming that there are n
data points in the population.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,410
And then you divide by the
total number that you have.

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,160
And this is like the average
that you're used to taking

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,550
before you learned any of
the statistics stuff.

32
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,200
You add up all the data
points and you divide by

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,690
the number there are.

34
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,310
The sample is the same thing.

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,130
We just use a slightly
different terminology.

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,730
The mean of a sample-- and
I'll do it in a different

37
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,730
color-- just write it as
x with a line on top.

38
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,730
And that's equal to the
sum of all the data

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,720
points in the sample.

40
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,060
So each of the xi
in the sample.

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,610
But we're serving the
sample is something

42
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,780
less than a population.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,310
So you start with the
first one still.

44
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,520
And then you go to the lower
case n where we assume that

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,000
lowercase n is less
than the big N.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,330
If this was the same thing then
we're actually taking the

47
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,320
average or we're taking the
mean of the entire population.

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,715
And then you divide by
the number of data

49
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:09,590
points you added.

50
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,960
You get to n.

51
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,720
Then we said OK, how far-- this
give us the central tendency.

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,230
It's one measure of
the central tendency.

53
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,680
But what if we wanted to know
how good of an indicator this

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
is for the population
or for the sample?

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,650
Or, on average, how far are the
data points from this mean?

56
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,360
And that's where we came up
with the concept of variance.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,930
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors again.

58
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:31,300
Variance.

59
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,820
   

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,790
And in a population the
variable or the notation for

61
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,160
variance is the sigma squared.

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,350
This means variance.

63
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,910
And that is equal to-- you
take each of the data points.

64
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,470
   

65
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,130
You find the difference between
that and the mean that

66
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,050
you calculate up there.

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,700
You square it so you get
the squared difference.

68
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,340
And then you essentially take
the average of all of these.

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,620
You take the average of all
of these squared distances.

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,290
So that's-- so you take the
sum from i is equal to 1 to

71
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,800
n and you divide it by n.

72
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,650
That's the variance.

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,450
And then the variance of a
sample mean-- and this was a

74
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,130
little bit more interesting
and we talked a little bit

75
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,320
about it in the last video.

76
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,850
You actually want to provide
a-- you want to estimate the

77
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,760
variance of the population
when you're taking the

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,250
variance of a sample.

79
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,220
And in order to provide an
unbiased estimate you do

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,360
something very similar
to here but you end up

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,710
dividing by n minus 1.

82
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,340
So let me write that down.

83
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,990
So the variance of a
population-- I'm sorry, the

84
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,610
variance of a sample or samples
variance or unbiased sample

85
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,530
variance if that's why we're
going to divide by n minus 1.

86
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,450
That's denoted by s squared.

87
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,220
What you do is you take the
difference between each of the

88
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,690
data points in the sample
minus the sample mean.

89
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,080
We assume that we don't
know the population mean.

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
Maybe we did.

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,230
If we knew the population mean
we actually wouldn't have to do

92
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,965
the unbiased thing they were
going to do here in

93
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:02,760
the denominator.

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,640
But when you have a sample the
only way to kind of figure out

95
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,100
the population mean is to
estimate it with sample mean.

96
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,020
So we assume that we only
have the sample mean.

97
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,410
And you're going to square
those and then you're going to

98
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:20,550
sum them up from i is equal to
1 to i is equal to n because

99
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,800
you have n data points.

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,440
And if you want an unbiased
estimator you divide

101
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,100
by n minus 1.

102
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,570
And we talked a little bit
before why you want this to be

103
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,880
a n minus 1 instead of a n.

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
And actually in a couple
of videos I'll actually

105
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,290
prove this to you.

106
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,470
One, I'll prove it maybe
experimentally using Excel and

107
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,470
then I'll-- which wouldn't be a
proof, it'll just give you a

108
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,330
little bit of intuition-- and
then I'll actually prove

109
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,870
it a little bit more
formally later on.

110
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,110
But you don't have to
worry about it right now.

111
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,620
The next thing we'll learn is
something that you've probably

112
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,880
heard a lot of, especially
sometimes in class, teachers

113
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,580
talk about the standard
deviation of a test or-- it's

114
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,380
actually probably one of the
most use words in statistics.

115
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,900
I think a lot of people
unfortunately maybe use it or

116
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,710
maybe use it without fully
appreciating everything

117
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,240
that it involves.

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,020
But the goal we'll eventually
hopefully appreciate

119
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,020
all that involves soon.

120
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,830
But the standard deviation--
and once you know variance it's

121
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,200
actually quite straightforward.

122
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,660
It's the square root
of the variance.

123
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,570
So the standard deviation of a
population is written as sigma

124
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,440
which is equal to the square
root of the variance.

125
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,980
And now I think you understand
why a variance is written

126
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,960
as sigma squared.

127
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,680
And that is equal to just the
square root of all that.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,310
It's equal to the square root--
I'll probably run out of

129
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,410
space-- of all of that.

130
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,790
So the sum-- I won't write at
the top or the bottom, that

131
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:58,400
makes it messy-- if xi minus Mu
squared, everything over n.

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
And then if you wanted the
standard deviation of a

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,020
sample-- and it actually gets a
little bit interesting because

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,670
the standard deviation of a
sample, which is equal to the

135
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,030
square root of the variance of
a sample-- it actually turned

136
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,770
out that this is not an
unbiased estimator for this--

137
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,150
and I don't want to get to
technical for it right now--

138
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,870
that this is actually a very
good estimate of this.

139
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,370
The expected value of this
is going to be this.

140
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,380
And I'll go into more depth on
expected values in the future.

141
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,230
But it turns out that this
is not quite the same

142
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,940
expected value as this.

143
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,790
But you don't have to
worry about it for now.

144
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,740
So why even talk about
the standard deviation?

145
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,320
Well, one, the units work
out a little better.

146
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,310
If let's say all of our
data points were measured

147
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,180
in meters, right?

148
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,880
If we were taking a bunch of
measurements of length then

149
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,110
the units of the variance
would be meter squared.

150
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,380
right?

151
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,210
Because we're taking
meters minus meters.

152
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,810
This would be a meter.

153
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,400
Then you're squaring.

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,130
You're getting meters squared.

155
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,350
And that's kind of a strange
concept if you say you know the

156
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,790
average dispersion from the
center is in meter squares.

157
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,120
Well first, when you take the
square root of it you get

158
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,750
this-- you get something
that's again in meters.

159
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,240
So you're kind of saying, oh
well the standard deviation

160
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,400
is x or y meters.

161
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,470
And then we'll learn a little
bit it if you can actually

162
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,320
model your data as a bell curve
or if you assume that your data

163
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,030
has a distribution of a bell
curve then this tells you some

164
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,270
interesting things about where
all of the probability of

165
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,600
finding someone within one or
two standard deviations

166
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,260
of the of the mean.

167
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,250
But anyway, I don't want to
go to technical right now.

168
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,910
Let's just calculate a bunch.

169
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,380
Let's calculate.

170
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,800
Let's see, if I had numbers
1, 2, 3, 8, and 7.

171
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,490
And let's say that
this is a population.

172
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,820
So what would its mean be?

173
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,100
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.

174
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,930
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.

175
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,100
6 plus 8 is 14.

176
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,490
14 plus 7 is 21.

177
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,620
So the mean of this
population-- you sum up

178
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,450
all the data points.

179
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:58,943
You get 21 divided by the
total number of data

180
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:01,270
points, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

181
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,440
21 divided by 5 which
is equal to what?

182
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,960
4.2.

183
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
Fair enough.

184
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,750
Now we want to figure
out the variance.

185
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,600
And we're assuming that this
is the entire population.

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,350
So the variance of this
population is going to be equal

187
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,600
to the sum of the squared
differences of each of

188
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,990
these numbers from 4.2.

189
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,140
I'm going to have to
get my calculator out.

190
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:30,720
So it's going to be 1 minus
4.2 squared plus 2 minus 4.2

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:39,940
squared plus 3 minus 4.2
squared plus 8 minus

192
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:47,342
4.2 squared plus 7
minus 4.2 squared.

193
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:50,210
And it's going to be all of
that-- I know it looks a little

194
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,990
bit funny-- divided by the
number of data points we

195
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,640
have-- divided by 5.

196
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,920
So let me take the
calculator out.

197
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,060
All right.

198
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,350
Here we go.

199
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,000
Actually maybe I should
have used the graphing

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,270
calculator that I have.

201
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,030
Let me see if I can get this
thing-- if I could get this.

202
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:19,780
   

203
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,220
There you go.

204
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah, I think the graphing
one will be better because

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,050
I can see everything
that I'm writing.

206
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,050
OK, so let me clear this.

207
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:43,210
So I want to take 1 minus 4.2
squared plus 2 minus 4.2

208
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:58,940
squared plus 3 minus 4.2
squared plus 8 minus 4.2

209
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,320
squared, where I'm just taking
the sum of the squared

210
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,910
distances from the mean
squared, one more, plus

211
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,510
7 minus 4.2 squared.

212
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,650
So that's the sum.

213
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,660
The sum is 38.8.

214
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,850
So the numerator is going to be
equal to 38.8 divided by 5.

215
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,410
So this is the sum of the
squared distances, right?

216
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,300
Each of these-- just so you can
relate to the formula-- each

217
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,500
of that is xi minus
the mean squared.

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,510
And so if we take the sum of
all of them-- this numerator is

219
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:39,940
the sum of each of the xi minus
the mean squared from

220
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,810
i equals 1 to n.

221
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,230
And that ended up to be 38.8.

222
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,550
And I just calculated
like that.

223
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,610
I just took each to the
data points minus the mean

224
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,650
squared, add them all
up, and I got 38.8.

225
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,920
And I went and divided
by n which is 5.

226
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,970
So this n up here is
actually also 5.

227
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,920
Right?

228
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:08,985
And so 38.8 divided
by 5 is 7.76.

229
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:14,280
So the variance-- let me scroll
down a little bit-- the

230
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,130
variance is equal to 7.76.

231
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,020
Now if this was a sample of a
larger distribution, if this

232
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,760
was a sample-- if the 1, 2,
3, 8, and 7, weren't the

233
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,800
population-- if it was a sample
from a larger population,

234
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,470
instead of dividing by 5 we
would have divided by 4.

235
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:42,180
And we would have gotten the
variance as 38.8 divided by n

236
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,090
minus 1, which is divided by 4.

237
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,280
So then we would have gotten
the variance-- we would have

238
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,760
gotten the sample variance
9.7 if you divided by n

239
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,070
minus 1 instead of n.

240
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,350
But anyway, don't worry
about that right now.

241
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,530
That's just a change of n.

242
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,190
But once you have the variance,
it's very easy to figure

243
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,960
out the standard deviation.

244
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,900
You just take the
square root of it.

245
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:09,710
The square root of 7.76-- 2.78.

246
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,900
Let's say 2.79 is the
standard deviation.

247
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,300
So this gives us some measure
of, on average, how far

248
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,040
the numbers are away from
the mean which was 4.2.

249
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,460
And it gives it in kind
of the units of the

250
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,460
original measurement.

251
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,050
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

252
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,990
I'll see you in the next video.

253
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,500
Or actually, let's figure out--
we said if this was a sample,

254
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,700
if those numbers were sample
and not the population, that

255
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,540
we figured out that the
sample variance was 9.7.

256
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,830
And so then the sample standard
deviation is just going to

257
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,690
be the square root of that.

258
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:52,430
The square root of 9.7
seven which would be 3.1.

259
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,450
3.11.

260
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,350
Anyway, hopefully that makes it
a little bit more concrete.

261
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,060
We've been dealing with these
sigma notation variables

262
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,940
and all that so far.

263
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,630
So when you actually do it
with numbers you see it's

264
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,860
hopefully not that difficult.

265
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,060
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

266
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,400
