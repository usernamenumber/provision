1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,860
In the last video, I showed the
Laplace transform of t, or

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,410
we could view that as t the
first power, is equal to 1/s

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,410
squared, if we assume that
s is greater than 0.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,100
In this video, we're going to
see if we can generalize this

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,270
by trying to figure out the
Laplace transform of t to the

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,660
n, where n is any integer power
greater than 0, so n is

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,575
any positive integer
greater than 0.

9
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:29,120
So let's try it out.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,060
So we know from our definition
of the Laplace transform that

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,930
the Laplace transform of t to
the n is equal to the integral

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,080
from 0 to infinity of our
function-- well, let me write

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,270
t to the n-- times, and this is
just the definition of the

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,420
transform, e to the
minus st, dt.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,280
And similar to when we figured
out this Laplace transform,

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,570
your intuition might be that,
hey, we should use integration

17
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,240
by parts, and I showed
it in the last video.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,769
I always forget it, but I just
recorded it, so I do happen to

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,860
remember it.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,000
So the integration by parts
just tells us that the

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,920
integral of uv prime is equal to
uv minus the integral of--

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,060
I view this as kind of the
swap-- so u prime v.

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,175
So this is just our integration
by parts formula.

24
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:26,720
If you ever forget it, you can
derive it in about 30 seconds

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,380
from the product rule.

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,630
And I did it in the last video
because I hadn't used it for

27
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,330
awhile, so I had
to rederive it.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,460
So let's apply it here.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,850
So what do we want to
make our v prime?

30
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,530
It's always good to use the
exponential function, because

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,140
that's easy to take the
antiderivative of.

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,540
So this is our v prime, in which
case our v is just the

33
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,130
antiderivative of that.

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,490
So it's e to the minus
st over minus s.

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,550
If we take the derivative of
this, minus s divided by minus

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,660
s cancels out, and you
just get that.

37
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,080
And then if we make our u-- let
me pick a good color here.

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,940
If we make this equal to our
u, what's our u prime?

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,700
u prime is just going to be n
times t to the n minus 1.

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,280
Fair enough.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,010
So let's apply the integration
by parts.

42
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,330
So this is going to
be equal to uv.

43
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,730
u, I'll use this t to the n, so
u is t to the n, that's our

44
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,880
u, times v, which is e-- let me
write this down-- so it's

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,075
minus-- there's a minus sign
there, so we put the minus.

46
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,510
Let me do it in that color.

47
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,920
   

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,555
I'm just rewriting this.
e to the minus st/s.

49
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,930
   

50
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,725
So that's the uv term
right there.

51
00:02:47,725 --> 00:02:50,180
Let me make that clear.

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,820
And let me pick a
good color here.

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,090
So this term right here is
this term right here.

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,040
And, of course, I'm going to
have to evaluate this from 0

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,615
to infinity, so let me write
that: 0 to infinity.

56
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,420
I could put a little bracket
there or something, but you

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,990
know we're going to have
to evaluate that.

58
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,560
And then from that, we're
going to have to

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,460
subtract the integral.

60
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,410
And let me not forget
our boundaries.

61
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:20,520
0 to infinity of u prime is n
times t to the n minus 1--

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,450
that's our u prime-- times v
times minus-- so let me put

63
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:34,220
this minus out here-- so minus
e to the minus st/s.

64
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,810
   

65
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,470
And then all of that.

66
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,700
Of course, we have our dt, and
you have a minus minus.

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,540
These things become pluses.

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,430
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

69
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,760
So we get our Laplace transform
of t to the n is

70
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,100
equal to this evaluated at
infinity and evaluated at 0.

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,800
So when you've evaluate-- what's
the limit of this as t

72
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,430
approaches infinity?

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,900
As t approaches infinity, this
term, you might say, oh, this

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,690
becomes really big.

75
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,610
And I went over this
in the last video.

76
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,800
But this term overpowers it,
because you're going to have e

77
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,980
to the minus infinity, if
we assume that s is

78
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,470
greater than 0.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,960
So if s is greater than 0, this
term is going to win out

80
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,970
and go to 0 much faster
than this term is

81
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,750
going to go to infinity.

82
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,770
So when you evaluate it at
infinity, when you evaluate

83
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,730
this at infinity, you're
going to get 0.

84
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,020
And then you're going to
subtract this evaluated at 0.

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,600
This evaluated at 0, when it's
evaluated at 0 is just minus 0

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,960
to the n times e to the minus
s times 0/s Well, this

87
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,980
becomes 0 as well.

88
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,220
So this whole term evaluated
from 0 to infinity is all 0,

89
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,720
which is a nice, convenient
thing for us.

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,100
And then we're going to have
this next term right there.

91
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,470
So let's take out the constant
terms. This n

92
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,150
and this s are constant.

93
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,335
They are constant with
respect to t.

94
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:06,990
So you have plus n/s times the
integral from 0 to infinity of

95
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:16,740
t to the n minus 1 times
e to the minus st, dt.

96
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,670
Now, this should look reasonably
familiar to you.

97
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,170
   

98
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,010
What's the definition of
the Laplace transform?

99
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:31,290
The Laplace transform of any
function is equal to the

100
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,750
integral from 0 to infinity of
that function times e to the

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,030
minus st, dt.

102
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,390
Well, when we have an e to the
minus st, dt, we're taking the

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,500
integral from 0 to infinity,
so this whole integral is

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,310
equal to the Laplace transform
of this, of t

105
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,930
to the n minus 1.

106
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,530
So just that easily, because
this term went to 0, we've

107
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,130
simplified things.

108
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:04,110
We get the Laplace transform
of t to the n is equal to--

109
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,830
this is all 0-- it's equal to
n/s-- that's right there--

110
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,640
times this integral right here,
which we just figured

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,000
out was the Laplace transform
of t to the n minus 1.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,070
Well, this is a nice,
neat simplification.

113
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,090
We can now figure out the
Laplace transform of a higher

114
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,645
power in terms of the one power
lower that, but it still

115
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,975
doesn't give me a generalized
formula.

116
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:31,060
So let's see if we can use this
with this information to

117
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,480
get a generalized formula.

118
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,790
So the Laplace transform of just
t-- so let me write that

119
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,030
down; I wrote that at the
beginning of the problem.

120
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,270
We get the Laplace transform, I
could write this as t to the

121
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,510
1, which is just t, is equal
to 1/s squared, where s is

122
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,050
greater than 0.

123
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,420
Now, what happens if
we take the Laplace

124
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,480
transform of t squared?

125
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,160
Well, we can just use this
formula up here.

126
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,460
The Laplace transform of t
squared is equal to 2/s times

127
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,760
the Laplace transform of t,
of just t to the 1, right?

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,580
2 minus 1.

129
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,550
So times the Laplace transform
of t to the 1.

130
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,520
Well, t, we know what that is.

131
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,510
This is equal to 2/s times this,
times 1/s squared, which

132
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,520
is equal to 2/s to the third.

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,310
Interesting.

134
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,820
Let's see if we can
do another one.

135
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,950
What is-- I'll do it in the
dark blue-- the Laplace

136
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,660
transform of t to the third?

137
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,370
Well, we just use this
formula up here.

138
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,200
It's n/s.

139
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,880
In this case, n is 3.

140
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,630
So it's 3/s times the Laplace
transform of t to the n minus

141
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,570
1, so t squared.

142
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,120
   

143
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,770
We know what the Laplace
transform of this one was.

144
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,400
This is just this right there.

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,980
So it's equal to 3/s
times this thing.

146
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,610
And I'm going to actually write
it this way, because I

147
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,390
think it's interesting.

148
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,560
So I'll write the numerator.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,310
Times 2 times 1/s over s
squared, which is-- we could

150
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,020
write it as 3 factorial
over-- what is this? s

151
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,270
to the fourth power.

152
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,340
   

153
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Let's do another one.

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,940
And I think you already are
getting the idea of

155
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,470
what's going on.

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,750
The Laplace transform of t to
the fourth power is what?

157
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:40,270
It's equal to 4/s times the
Laplace transform of t the

158
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,710
third power.

159
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,169
And that's just 4/s
times this.

160
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,150
So it's 4/s times 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

161
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,790
So now 4 times 3 factorial,
that's just 4 factorial over s

162
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,120
to the fifth.

163
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,490
And so you can just get
the general principle.

164
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,100
And we can prove this
by induction.

165
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,235
It's almost trivial based on
what we've already done.

166
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:14,710
That the Laplace transform of
t to the n is equal to n

167
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,740
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

168
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,250
We proved it directly for this
base case right here.

169
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,290
This is 1 factorial over
s to the 1 plus 1.

170
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,610
And then if we know it's true
for this, we know it's going

171
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,940
to be true for the
next increment.

172
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,850
So induction proof is almost
obvious, but you can even see

173
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,970
it based on this.

174
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,330
If you have to figure out the
Laplace transform of t to the

175
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,500
tenth, you could just keep
doing this over and over

176
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,000
again, but I think you see the
pattern pretty clearly.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,940
So anyway, I thought that was
a neat problem in and of

178
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,730
itself, outside of the fact,
it'll be useful when we figure

179
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,620
out inverse and Laplace
transforms. But this is a

180
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,640
pretty neat result.

181
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,730
The Laplace transform of t to
the n, where n is some integer

182
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,480
greater than 0 is equal to n
factorial over s to the n plus

183
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,690
1, where s is also
greater than 0.

184
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,290
That was an assumption we had to
make early on when we took

185
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,250
our limits as t approaches
infinity.

186
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,390
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

187
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,865
