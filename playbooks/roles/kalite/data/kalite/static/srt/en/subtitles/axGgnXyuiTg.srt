1
00:00:00,884 --> 00:00:10,217
In the circle below, central angle GOH has a measure of 3/2 radians.

2
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:14,383
What is the length of arc GH?

3
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:17,617
So let's define some variables that will help us manipulate them a little bit easier.

4
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:22,684
So where is central angle GOH? It's this angle right over here.

5
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:35,867
Let's call that "theta". So let's say that theta is equal to the measure of angle GOH.

6
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:40,717
Now, they're asking us "what's the length of arc GH?"

7
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:45,467
Well arc GH is this, right over here. And let's call that 's'.

8
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:54,383
So let's let s be equal to the length of arc GH.

9
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:59,867
And they also give us the radius 6cm for this circle, but let's just call that 'r' for now

10
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:03,613
so the radius is equal to 6cm.

11
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,673
So the first thing that we should think about when we're dealing with arc lengths and radians

12
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:12,934
is 'how do angles measured in radians relate to arc length in particular-

13
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:20,733
how does an angle measured in radians relate to the length of the arc that subtends that angle?'

14
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:24,884
In this case, the length of this arc right over here, arc GH

15
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:30,434
subtends angle theta- subtends central angle GOH.

16
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:37,817
So what's the relationship? Well the definition of radian measure says that an angle measured in radians

17
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:46,000
is the ratio between the length of the arc that subtends that angle, so s

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,234
and the radius of the circle.

19
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:56,367
If this was a unit circle, then it would just literally be equal to that arc length.

20
00:01:56,367 --> 00:02:02,918
If it's not a unit circle, or I guess in all cases, unit circle or not, it's the ratio between the length of the arc

21
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:08,017
that subtends the angle and the radius.

22
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:15,567
Now, given this definition of what a radian is, let's see what we know and what we don't know.

23
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:23,134
And we can manipulate this however we see fit, we could mutiply- you could see this written as if you multiply both sides of this by r

24
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:28,983
you get r theta is equal to s

25
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:37,430
or another way of writing it is you could get s is equal to r times theta.

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,318
s is equal to r theta

27
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,484
And we could have solved this equation or this equation, but for this problem

28
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:48,067
- this one's actually going to be a little bit useful, because this is the unknown, the length of GH

29
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,817
we want to know what this is, this is the unknown that they're asking for

30
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:56,484
and this explicitly solves for the unknown, so this has essentially solved it for us.

31
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:58,484
So what else do we know?

32
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:01,834
Well, we know the radius, we know the radius is 6cm.

33
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:06,800
We multiply that times the angle in radians, which is 3/2 radians

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,734
and we are left with, so s is equal to 6cm times 3/2, and so we are left with, this is going to be equal to

35
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:20,717
6 times 3 is 18 divided by 2 is 9.

36
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:25,586
It's going to be equal to 9cm.

37
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:29,586
And we are done.
