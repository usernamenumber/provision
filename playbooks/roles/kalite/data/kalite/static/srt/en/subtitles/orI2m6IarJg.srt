00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
In diesem Video will ich wiederholen, was wir in unserem Chemieunterricht Ã¼ber die Oxidation und das Gegenteil der Oxidation, die Reduktion, gelernt haben.

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,900
What I want to do in this
video is review what we

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,540
learned from our chemistry
classes about oxidation and

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,450
the opposite of oxidation,
reduction.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,510
And then see how what we learned
in our chemistry class

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,100
relates to the way that a
biologist or biochemist might

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,960
use these words.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,270
And hopefully we'll see that
they're the same thing.

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,450
So just as a bit of review, if
you watched the chemistry

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,490
playlist. Oxidation, you can
view it-- and actually there's

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,955
a famous mnemonic for it.

12
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:35,980
It's: OIL RIG Where the oil
tells us that oxidation is

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,940
losing-- I put it in quotes
because you're not necessarily

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,430
losing the electrons; I'll
show you what I mean-- is

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,380
losing electrons.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,630
This is what you should
have learned in

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,650
your chemistry class.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:54,020
And then you also learned that
reduction is gaining.

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,920
And I'll put that in
quotes as well.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,870
Is gaining electrons.

21
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,180
And I put that in quotes because
you're not necessarily

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,400
gaining electrons.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,860
You're more hogging it.

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,180
And the reason why it's called
reduction, is because if you

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,400
are gaining electrons your
notional charge, if you really

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,940
were gaining them,
is being reduced.

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,390
And the reason why this is
called oxidizing is because

28
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,000
you tend to lose electrons
to oxygen.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Although it doesn't
have to be oxygen.

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,820
It could be any molecule
that will hog

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,840
electrons away from you.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,150
And I think a nice example would
be fair to kind of make

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,760
this a little bit
more concrete.

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,770
Let's say I took some molecular
hydrogen, it's in a

35
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,180
gaseous state, and I were to
combust that with some

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,030
molecular oxygen.

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,950
This is what happened
on the Hindenburg.

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,470
They filled a balloon full of
hydrogen and you get a little

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,630
bit of spark, expose it to
oxygen, and you're going to

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,050
have a big explosion.

41
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,040
But in the process, for every
mole of molecular oxygen, if

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,060
you have two moles of molecular
hydrogen-- I'm just

43
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,070
making sure the equation is
balanced-- you're going to

44
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:01,070
produce two moles of H2O
plus a ton of heat.

45
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,440
This thing is really
going to blow.

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,229
What I want to do, I mean
we could talk about the

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,190
Hindenburg but really, the whole
reason why I even wrote

48
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,530
this is, I want to show you what
is getting oxidized and

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,600
what is getting reduced.

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,760
So in this situation right
here on the hydrogen, the

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,630
molecular hydrogen just
looks like this.

52
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,660
You have a hydrogen-hydrogen
bond.

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,540
They're each sharing an electron
with the other one so

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,840
that they both can pretend
their 1s orbital

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,260
is completely filled.

56
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,180
So they're not losing electrons
to each other.

57
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,490
They're not hogging electrons
one from the other.

58
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,500
So we say that they have a
neutral oxidative state.

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,410
They haven't gained
or lost electrons.

60
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,530
They're just sharing them.

61
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,690
And the same thing is true
for the molecular oxygen.

62
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,920
And here you actually
have a double bond

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,890
with the two oxygens.

64
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,310
But they're both oxygens, so
there's no reason why one

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,240
would gain or lose electrons
from the other.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,590
But when you go on this side
of the equation, something

67
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,440
interesting happens.

68
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,080
You have, for every oxygen is
connected to two hydrogens.

69
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,780
And the way to think about is
that oxygen is hogging each of

70
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,640
these hydrogen's electrons.

71
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,280
So hydrogen has this one
electron on its valence shell.

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,910
The deal with most covalent
bonding is, hey, I give you an

73
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,910
electron, you give me an
electron and we both have a

74
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,930
complete pair.

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,160
But we know, or hopefully we
can review, that oxygen is

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,510
much more electronegative
than hydrogen.

77
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,190
This is a little bit of glucose
that's left over from

78
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,150
our cellular restoration
video.

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,060
You can ignore it for now but
I'm going to connect all this

80
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,870
in a future video.

81
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,990
But if we look at our periodic
table, if you remember from

82
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,510
the chemistry playlist,
electronegativity increases as

83
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,470
we go to the top right of
the periodic table.

84
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,210
These are the most
electronegative elements over

85
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,680
here, these are the least
electronegative.

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,240
And all electronegative means
is, likes to hog electrons.

87
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,190
So even though oxygen and
hydrogen are in a covalent

88
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,950
bond in water-- they're sharing
electrons-- oxygen is

89
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,580
more electronegative, much
more electronegative than

90
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,740
hydrogen, so it's going
to hog the electrons.

91
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,019
And actually if you take some
elements on this side and you

92
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,890
bond them with some guys over
here, these guys are so much

93
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,080
more electronegative than these
left-hand elements that

94
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,100
they'll actually completely
steal the electron, not just

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,130
hog it for most of the time.

96
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,990
But when you talk
electronegativity, it just

97
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,410
means, likes the electrons.

98
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,800
So when you look at this bond
between hydrogen and oxygen,

99
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,300
we saw from the periodic table,
oxygen is a lot more

100
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,280
electronegative, so the
electrons spend a lot more

101
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,880
time on oxygen.

102
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,190
We learned about hydrogen
bonding.

103
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,780
We learned that it creates a
partial negative charge on

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,630
that side of the water molecule
and creates partial

105
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,810
positive charges on this side.

106
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,760
And electrons still show
up around the hydrogens

107
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,930
every now and then.

108
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,460
When you talk about oxidation
and reduction you say, look

109
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,130
there's no partial charge.

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,110
If one guy is kind of hogging
the electron more, for the

111
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,890
sake of oxidation states, we're
going to assume that he

112
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,470
took the electron.

113
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,580
So for an oxidation state, we'll
assume that the oxygen

114
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,220
in water takes the electron
and we'll give him an

115
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,740
oxidation state of one minus.

116
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,600
Or the convention is, you write
the charge after the

117
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
number for oxidation states.

118
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
So you don't confuse it
with actual charges.

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,210
So this has a one minus because,
from an oxidation

120
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,110
state point of view, it's
taking the electron.

121
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,620
It's gaining the elctron.

122
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,950
That's why I put it in quotes.

123
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,360
Because you're not really
gaining it.

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,160
You're just gaining it
most of the time.

125
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,190
You're hogging electrons.

126
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,370
And likewise, this hydrogen--
let me be careful, this

127
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,440
isn't-- he got one electron from
this hydrogen and you got

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,950
another electron from
this hydrogen.

129
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,890
So instead of saying one minus,
it should be two minus.

130
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,590
It should be two minus, because
he's hogging one

131
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,140
electron from here and one
electron from there.

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,570
And in general, when oxygen is
bonding with other non-oxygen

133
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,980
atoms or non-oxygen elements,
it tends to have a two minus

134
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,050
or a negative two
oxidation state.

135
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,850
So if this guy's two
minus, because

136
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,250
he's gained two electrons.

137
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,870
Let me write that in quotes.

138
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,710
Gained two electrons.

139
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,920
We know that he really didn't
gain them, that he's just

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,840
hogging them.

141
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,790
These guys lost an
electron each.

142
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,240
So this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,840
And this guy's oxidation state
is going to be one plus.

144
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,930
So you could say, by combusting
the hydrogen with

145
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,060
the oxygen, that the hydrogens--
before they had a

146
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,120
zero oxygen state, each of these
hydrogens had a zero

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,410
oxygen state-- now they have
a one plus oxidation state

148
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,660
because they lost their
electrons when they bonded

149
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
with the oxygen.

150
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,540
So we say that these hydrogens
have been oxidized.

151
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:05,270
So, due to this reaction,
hydrogen has been oxidized.

152
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,880
Why has it been oxidized?

153
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
Because before, it was
able to share its

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
electrons very nicely.

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,210
But then it bonds with oxygen,
which will hog its electrons.

156
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,780
So the hydrogen is losing its
electrons to the oxygen, so

157
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,320
it's been oxidized.

158
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,270
Similarly, the oxygen, due to
this combustion reaction, has

159
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:31,070
been reduced.

160
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,130
Why has it been reduced?

161
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,850
Here it was just sharing
electrons.

162
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,330
It wasn't losing
or gaining it.

163
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,590
But here when it's bonded with
an element with much lower

164
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,460
electronegativity, all of a
sudden it can start hogging

165
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,450
the electrons, it
gains electrons.

166
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,785
So this hypothetical charge
is reduced by two.

167
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,050
And if I wanted to actually
account for all of the

168
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,170
electrons, because we're talking
about losing electrons

169
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,710
and gaining electrons, we can
write two half reactions.

170
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,280
This should all be a little
bit of review from your

171
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,030
chemistry class.

172
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,780
But it never hurts to
see this again.

173
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going to throw this in the
biology playlist so that you

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,270
biology people can hopefully
refresh your

175
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,010
memory with this stuff.

176
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,440
We can write two
half reactions.

177
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
We could say that we started
off with two moles of

178
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,150
molecular hydrogen.

179
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:21,150
And they have no oxidation
states, or they're neutral.

180
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,010
So I could write a zero
there if I want.

181
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,020
And then I end up with-- on the
other side-- I end up with

182
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,340
two moles of H2.

183
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,760
But each of the hydrogens
now, have a plus

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,010
one oxidation state.

185
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,580
Or another way to think about it
is, each of these-- there's

186
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,940
four hydrogens here.

187
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,380
This is molecular hydrogen has
two hydrogens and we have two

188
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,050
moles of this.

189
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,650
So there are four
hydrogens here.

190
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,480
Each of the four hydrogens
lost an electron.

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,160
So I can write this.

192
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,530
So, plus four electrons.

193
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,460
That's the half reaction
for hydrogen.

194
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,640
It lost four electrons.

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,300
So this is another way of
saying that hydrogen is

196
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,000
oxidized because it
lost electrons.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
OIL: oxidation is losing.

198
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,470
And then the other half
reaction, if I were to write

199
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,750
the oxygen.

200
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,640
So I'm starting with a mole of
molecular oxygen and I'm

201
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,570
adding to that four electrons.

202
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,970
I can't make electrons
out of nowhere.

203
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,040
I'm getting the electrons from
the hydrogen, I'm adding to

204
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
the oxygen.

205
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,560
And so the half reaction on this
side, I end up with two

206
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,650
moles-- I could write it like
this-- two moles of oxygen.

207
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,840
And each of them have an
oxidation state of two minus.

208
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,080
So these are the
half reactions.

209
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,630
And all this is showing is that
the hydrogen, over the

210
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,310
course of this combustion
reaction, lost electrons.

211
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,830
And that the oxygen gained the
electrons that the hydrogen

212
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:02,370
lost. So this tells us that
oxygen is reduced.

213
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,120
Now this is all fair and good
and this is all a bit of

214
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,410
review of what you learned
in chemistry class.

215
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,520
But now I'm going to make things
even more confusing.

216
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,770
Because I'm going to introduce
you to how a biologist

217
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,730
thinks about it.

218
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,350
So-- and it's not
always the case.

219
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,440
Sometimes the biologist will use
the definition you learned

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
in your chemistry class.

221
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,710
But a biologist-- or many
times in many biology

222
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,915
textbooks-- they'll say-- and
this used to confuse me to no

223
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:39,220
end, really-- that oxidation is
losing hydrogen atoms. And

224
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:52,210
reduction is gaining
hydrogen atoms.

225
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,570
And at first when I got exposed
to this, I was like, I

226
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,190
learned it in chemistry class
and they talk about electrons.

227
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,280
Hydrogen atoms, you know it's a
proton and an electron, how

228
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,130
does it relate?

229
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,550
And the reason why these two
definitions-- this is really

230
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,460
the whole point of this video--
the reason why this

231
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,580
definition is consistent with
this one is because in the

232
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:21,190
biological world hydrogen
is what tends

233
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,230
to get swapped around.

234
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,970
And it tends to bond with
carbon, oxygen,

235
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,500
phosphorous, nitrogen.

236
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,570
And if we look at the periodic
table, and we see where

237
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,840
hydrogen is, and we see where
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and

238
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,700
phosphorous and really all this
other stuff is, you see

239
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,840
that all of the stuff that in
biological systems, hydrogen

240
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,570
tends to bond with, the things
it tends to bond with are

241
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,920
much, much more electronegative.

242
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,270
So if a carbon is bonding with
a hydrogen, the carbon is

243
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,740
hogging that electron.

244
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,610
And then if that hydrogen gets
transferred to an oxygen,

245
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,260
along with the electron, the
carbon will lose the hydrogen

246
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,220
atom, but it really lost
the electron that

247
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,450
it was hogging before.

248
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,940
And now the oxygen can
hog that electron.

249
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,990
So these are really consistent
definitions.

250
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,690
And the whole reason why I
showed you this example is

251
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,760
because the biological
definition doesn't apply here.

252
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,900
I mean, you could say, well,
oxygen is definitely gaining

253
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,650
hydrogens in this reaction.

254
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,000
So we can definitely say that
oxygen is being reduced still,

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,110
according to the biological
definition.

256
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,780
But you can't really say
that hydrogen is

257
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,740
losing hydrogens here.

258
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,840
In this situation, hydrogen
is just losing electrons.

259
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,290
It's not losing itself.

260
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,120
I guess you could say it's
losing itself because it's

261
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,090
being taken over.

262
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,920
But the biological definition
just comes

263
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,830
from the same notion.

264
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,450
That when hydrogen bonds with
most things in biological

265
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,520
compounds, it tends to
give the electrons.

266
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,740
So if a carbon loses a hydrogen
and gives it to an

267
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,940
oxygen, the carbon will lose
that hydrogen's electron that

268
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,170
it was able to hog.

269
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,850
And now the oxygen
is hogging it.

270
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,500
So the carbon would be oxidized
and the oxygen would

271
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,370
be reduced.

272
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,310
Hope that doesn't confuse you.

273
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,820
In the next video I'll show you
a couple more examples.

274
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,630
And the whole reason why I'm
doing this is to apply this to

275
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,090
cellular respiration.

276
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,350
So that you don't get confused
when people talk and say that,

277
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,710
oh the NAD is being reduced when
it picks up the hydrogen.

278
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,310
Or it's being oxidized when it
loses the hydrogen, and so

279
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:23,980
forth and so on.

280
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,030
I wanted you to see that these
are the same definitions that

281
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,540
you learned in your
chemistry class.
