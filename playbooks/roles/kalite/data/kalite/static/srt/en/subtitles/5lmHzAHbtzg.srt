1
00:00:00,623 --> 00:00:03,761
Let's say that both Ben's Shoes and Jason's Shoes

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:05,623
are publicly traded companies

3
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,373
All that means is that

4
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:10,654
both of their shares are traded on exchanges

5
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:14,659
Maybe it's the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange or some other exchange

6
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:17,945
And going price on those exchanges:

7
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:23,267
The last closing price for Ben's stock was $21.50/share

8
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:27,842
The last closing price for Jason's stock was $12.00/share

9
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:29,033
What I want to explore in this video,

10
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:30,504
and probably next video, is

11
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:31,805
what is that saying for

12
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:35,220
what the market thinks of these businesses are worth

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,835
So in both of these situations

14
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:39,086
they have 10,000 shares

15
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,401
Remember the shares are split of the owner's equities

16
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,270
not the split of the assets

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,667
It's the split of just the equity part right over here

18
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,285
So if theshareholders are wiling to pay

19
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:52,772
$21.50/share for Ben's stock,

20
00:00:52,772 --> 00:00:55,753
and there are 10,000 shares in Ben's company

21
00:00:55,753 --> 00:01:05,935
So you take $21.50 times 10,000 shares

22
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:20,792
gives us a market cap of $215,000

23
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,349
What this says is look

24
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,981
if each of those 10,000 slices of the equities

25
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,809
are worth $21.50

26
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:30,162
then the entire equity portion is going to be

27
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:34,625
what the market is valuing it at $215,000

28
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,642
And this calculation, this multiplication of

29
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:39,726
market price per share times the number of shares

30
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:43,475
this is called the market cap

31
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:45,841
Short for market capitalization

32
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:47,625
the market cap of the company

33
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,797
And all it is, is

34
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:52,153
what is market valuing the equity part

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,896
of Ben's company worth

36
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,688
Let's do the same thing for Jason's company

37
00:01:55,688 --> 00:02:07,902
You have $12/share times 10,000 shares

38
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:12,419
That gives us $120,000 market cap

39
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,269
So the market is telling us that

40
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,602
even though on the books Ben's equity

41
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,437
based on how he values his assets and liabilities

42
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:23,075
is $135,000

43
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,868
The market is actually valuing this at $215,000

44
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,468
And in the next video we'll think about

45
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:31,336
how the market is actually valuing the business

46
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:34,000
And in the case of Jason's business

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,753
Instead of $35,000 of equity

48
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:39,886
just straight up from what's on the books

49
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:45,898
the market is valuing this piece right here at $120,000

50
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,800
So hopefully that gives you a little sense of

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,323
One, what shares are share of

52
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:51,792
They're the share of owner's equity

53
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,108
and not of the asset

54
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:56,315
also gives you a good sense of what market cap is

55
00:02:56,315 --> 00:03:00,077
It's the market's value of the owner's equity

56
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:02,867
And notice in both cases, and it's usually the case

57
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,721
it's going to be a different number than the book value

58
00:03:05,721 --> 99:59:59,999
the number that's actually on the books
