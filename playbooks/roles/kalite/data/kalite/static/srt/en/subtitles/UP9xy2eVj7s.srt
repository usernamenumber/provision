00:00:00,503 --> 00:00:03,363
In the first video 
on social security, I keep talking about

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:06,382
how the tax 
that you pay for social security is called

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,059
the FICA tax.

4
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:09,752
What I want to do in this video is

5
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,647
one, let you know what FICA actually stands for

6
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,475
and then think a little bit 
how it is actually calculated.

7
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,289
So first, what does it stand for?

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,258
Literally it stands for

9
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:28,328
(while writing) 
Federal... Insurance... Contributions... Act...

10
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:29,910
That's the acronym.

11
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,382
So it'd be FICA 
and some people will call it FICA tax.

12
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,870
FICA tax.

13
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:37,143
This isn't just to support social security

14
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:42,315
or to be technically correct to support 
the old age survivors and disability insurance.

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:47,515
It's also...
part of FICA tax is for that and part is for Medicare

16
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:52,526
So to make things clear...
So it's the part of our social security

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,887
or what we associate with social security
which is really the OASDI

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,890
did I get that right? OASDI...

19
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:08,099
So, part of it is for social security
and then that part is 12.4%... of the gross salary

20
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:13,459
but half of that is paid for by the employer 
and half is paid by the employee.

21
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:15,001
We'll do a calculation in a second

22
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:17,878
so 6.2% and 6.2%.

23
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:22,690
The part is paid by the employer - 
that's part of the payroll tax

24
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:27,289
stuff that the employer pays above and beyond 
the gross income that they're giving to the employee

25
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:28,741
We'll do that calculation in a second.

26
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,655
The other thing that FICA tax is used for is Medicare...

27
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:33,371
Medicare...

28
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,858
This is for 
total amount of 2.9% of the employee's gross salary

29
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:43,447
or 1.45% from the employer
as part of the payroll tax,

30
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:47,341
and 1.45% from the employee...

31
00:01:47,388 --> 00:01:52,251
If you add these two things up
you get 15.3% total FICA tax.

32
00:01:52,358 --> 00:01:58,860
15.3%... once again half is paid by 
the employer and half is paid by the employee.

33
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,387
Now let's just do calculations 
so that it makes a little more tangible sense

34
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,845
of what I am even talking about with this FICA tax.

35
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,998
So, let's imagine that you make 100,000$ a year

36
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:11,023
and it's a nice number because 
it makes the maths easy.

37
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:19,035
Then your employer... employee...
Let me write it like this...

38
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,529
Employer... employee...

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,177
So, for social security... 
your employer will contribute 6.2% of this.

40
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:31,984
So above and beyond paying
the 100,000$ gross salary, they will also pay 6.2%

41
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:38,818
or 6,200$...
The employee will also pay 6,200$

42
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:46,263
and that will be deducted from 
their paycheck so what they get net of 6,200$

43
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:50,043
and then for Medicare...
we'll do that in pink...

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,202
Then for Medicare the employer will contribute 1,450$

45
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:59,718
once again 
above and beyond the gross salary of 100,000$

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:06,219
and the employee will pay 
1,450 out of their gross salary.

47
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:09,927
So the total amount 
that is paid by the employer...

48
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,108
Total amount paid by the employer...

49
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:17,690
...is 7,650$ in payroll tax for this one employee

50
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:23,828
and the total amount 
by the employee is the exact same amount: 7,650.

51
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:27,146
So just to be clear,
if you want hire an employee

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,099
and pay them a 100,000$ in gross salary

53
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:35,778
you actually have to set aside a 100,000$ and 7,650.

54
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,767
So the employer... 
the total that the employer is paying...

55
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:44,209
the employer...
the total that they're paying... total paying...

56
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:46,307
Or let me just think of it this way...

57
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:49,405
The total that the employer has to set aside...

58
00:03:51,957 --> 00:04:01,465
If you include the salary is going to be... 
107,650$ so they can cover the gross salary

59
00:04:01,512 --> 00:04:03,985
plus this payroll tax over here.

60
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,154
The net that the employee is getting...

61
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,108
The net that the employee is getting...

62
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,439
and once actually this isn't even the net,
I shouldn't call it the net...

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:20,208
the employee is getting after paying FICA taxes
is going to be a 100,000 minus 7,650

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,769
but I won't even write that number down

65
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:27,319
oh, I mean, what is that?
That's... 92,350$

66
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:30,721
because that's before paying 
just the traditional federal income tax

67
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,652
and the traditional state income tax

68
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,473
so that's gonna cut it down a good bit

69
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:38,429
so the employee is gonna take home
probably on the order of 60,000-70,000$

70
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:41,326
so above and beyond this thing right here.

71
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,959
So even if the employer is paying this much, 
the employee is getting a lot less

72
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:47,018
in terms of what they get to take home.

73
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:50,433
Now one thing that I think it is worth mentioning

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,158
is on like traditional federal income tax...

75
00:04:53,296 --> 00:04:58,309
in traditional federal income tax your first several 
tens of thousands dollars you make

76
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:01,418
are not taxed and as you go up the brackets

77
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,477
each incremental dollar 
as you enter one bracket or another

78
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,013
you start to pay a higher percentage on those.

79
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,321
The FICA tax is actually very different

80
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:11,066
some people would even 
call it a regressive income tax.

81
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:16,114
That's because you only pay
the FICA tax on the first 160,000

82
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:18,546
and at least this is the number in 2011

83
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:23,138
you only pay on the first 160,800$.

84
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:27,678
So someone 
who makes 200,000$ will pay the same FICA tax

85
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:31,257
as someone who makes a 160,800$.

86
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,313
So you only pay it on the percentage below that

87
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,781
and the reason why is it
that the person making 200,000$

88
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:43,107
will get the exact same benefits
as well as the person who makes 160,800$

89
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,145
and this number... 
essentially they tried index it roughly to inflation

90
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:55,266
so it will go up over time... but to some degree 
someone who makes, let's say, below this threshold

91
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,559
is gonna pay this percentage
between them and their employer

92
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:00,782
is gonna pay this percentage of their income.

93
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:04,697
While someone who makes much more than this
will have to pay a smaller percentage of their income

94
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:06,752
but they'll end up getting the same benefits.

95
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,612
And so, that's one reason 
why it is considered regressive

96
00:06:09,658 --> 00:06:14,744
is that as you make more money you're paying 
a smaller percentage of your income on FICA tax

97
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:19,976
and the other reason why it's considered
regressive is actually on the benefits side.

98
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,788
Because obviously someone who...

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,551
if you have two people 
receiving social security benefits...

100
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,688
so you have this person, 
so when this is when they turn 65...

101
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,450
let me put it this way...

102
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,841
So let's say that you have two people...
they worked their whole lives

103
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:37,741
and let's say they both retire at 65...
although that the retirement age is increasing...

104
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,449
It's slowly being indexed up

105
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,493
and then they retire.

106
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,498
It's known that the wealthier people...

107
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,488
And there's also 
a demographic space on race and things like that...

108
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,049
but it's known that wealthier people actually live longer

109
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,910
so they actually get benefits 
for a longer period of time.

110
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:57,971
So they're actually able 
to get their benefits for longer.

111
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:01,975
So it depends when you fall into it
likely, that even though there's this cap

112
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:06,373
someone higher up the income chain
also probably did pay more into it

113
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:09,423
but they're also getting 
a bigger check for paying more into it

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,492
the check that you eventually get is based
to some degree on what level of FICA tax

115
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:19,545
you were paying and they're very well likely
to be able to collect this payments for longer

116
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:26,187
than someone who maybe doesn't have
quite the same... I guess, quality of life

117
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,167
and doesn't actually live as long.
