1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:10,350
We're on problem 96. It says 1/2 plus,open brackets,

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:22,580
2/3 times 3/8 divided by 4 minus 9/16.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,950
Do you know order of operations,

4
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,350
and can you deal with fractions?

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,740
2/3 times 3/8,the 3's cancel out,

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,350
and the 2 and the 8 become 1/4.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:44,380
1/4 divided by 4,let me write this,1/2 plus 1/4 divided by 4,

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,860
that's the same thing as times 1/4,minus 9 over 16.

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:57,600
So that is equal to 1/2 plus 1/16 minus 9/16.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,290
And now it doesn't matter what order we do it in,but since

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,870
everything's in 1/16ths,so let me write this in 1/16ths.

12
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:08,560
So this is 8/16 plus 1/16 minus 9/16.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,570
So that's equal to 8 plus 1 minus 9 all over that 16.

14
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,090
That's 9 minus 9,that equals 0.

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,700
Choice E,all that work to get to 0. Next problem,97.

16
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,380
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen,

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,980
and the approximate ratio by mass of hydrogen to oxygen

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,480
is equal to 2:16. Approximately how many grams of oxygen

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,830
are there in 144 grams of water? OK,144 grams of water,

20
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,100
that means that the oxygen and hydrogen is equal to 144.

21
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,800
They say 144 grams of water,

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,870
not when you have 144 grams of hydrogen.

23
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,530
So when you add these together,you have 144.

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,540
And then they tell us that the ratio of hydrogen

25
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,460
to oxygen is 2:16. Or another way to write it,

26
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,270
you can say hydrogen over oxygen is equal to 2/16,

27
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,670
which is another way of saying 1/8.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,400
And they want to know how many grams of oxygen,

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
so we want to solve for oxygen,

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,870
so we want to substitute for hydrogen.

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,320
So we could say hydrogen is equal to 1/8th the oxygen.

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,090
I just multiplied both sides times oxygen.

33
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,870
So if hydrogen is equal to 1/8 oxygen,

34
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,330
you have oxygen plus 1/8 oxygen,

35
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,300
let me make sure that's right.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,830
Yeah,hydrogen to oxygen is equal to 144.

37
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,710
And if you view this as 8/8,1 oxygen is the same thing as 8/8

38
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,220
so you get 9/8 oxygen is equal to 144.

39
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:03,080
So you get oxygen is equal to 144 times 8 over 9.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,930
Does 9 go into 144? I think it should,

41
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,760
let me see how many times does 9-- 3 definitely does.

42
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,550
This is 12 times 12,so 3 will go into 144 48 times.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,170
9 goes into 144 1,9,54,16 times.

44
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,450
So this is equal to 16 times 8 over 1,which is what?

45
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,990
That's equal to 250-- no,that can't be right.

46
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:50,140
No,you can't have more grams of oxygen than you do--

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,020
let me see,I've made a mistake someplace.

48
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Hydrogen to oxygen is equal to 2:16,which is 1:8.

49
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,260
Oxygen plus hydrogen is equal to 144,you get 9/8.

50
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,470
Oh,I see my mistake. That's good.

51
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,900
I've been making a lot of careless mistakes,

52
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,430
maybe I need to take a rest.9/8 oxygen is equal to 144,

53
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,710
so oxygen is equal to 144 times 9 over 8-- sorry,

54
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,040
times 8 over 9. I was doing it right,so where was my mistake?

55
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,850
So 144 times 8 over 9,that's equal to--

56
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,070
oh,I just made a mistake at the very last step.

57
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:45,690
9 goes into 144 16 times. 16 times 8 isn't 256,it's 128.

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,200
That was my mistake. So there's 128 grams of oxygen.

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,420
I just made a mistake right at that last step. All right.

60
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,300
And that's choice D. Question 98.

61
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:12,070
If x times 2x plus 1 is equal to 0,and they also tell us that

62
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:22,300
x plus 1/2 times 2x minus 3 is equal to 0,

63
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,750
then x is equal to what? So this is interesting.

64
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,750
x times 2x plus 1 is equal to 0,that means that either x or

65
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,950
2x plus 1 has to be equal to 0.

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,440
So one of these has to be equal to 0.

67
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,280
But then x plus 1/2 times 2x plus 3,this tell us that

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,140
one of these have to be equal to 0. So if x is equal to 0,

69
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,550
then this has to be the one that's equal to 0.

70
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,610
So either this and that is equal to zero,

71
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,300
or-- do you see that?

72
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,200
Well I guess both of these could be equal to 0.

73
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,390
Let me multiply them out.Maybe I'm going down the wrong path.

74
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:02,250
If I multiply these out,I get 2x squared plus 2

75
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,040
is equal to 0. If I multiply these out,I get x times 2x,

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,930
which is 2x squared,x times minus 3 minus 3x,1/2 times 2x,

77
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,660
so it's plus x. And then 1/2 times minus 3 minus 3/2

78
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:31,790
is equal to 0, so I get what? 2x squared minus 2x.

79
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,700
3x plus x is minus 2x,minus 3/2 is equal to 0.

80
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,560
Actually I think I made a mistake,x times 2x plus 1,

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,540
that's not right. That's 2x squared plus x is equal to 0.

82
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,580
Fair enough. We know 2x squared,

83
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,240
so we can just write that 2x squared is equal to minus x,

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,500
and then substitute this information in here.

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
So we get minus x,2x squared is equal to minus x.

86
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,660
Minus x minus 2x minus 3/2 is equal to 0.

87
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,230
So you get minus 3x,let's add 3/2 to both sides,

88
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,390
is equal to 3/2. And then divide both sides by minus 3,

89
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,380
you get x is equal to 3/2 times minus 1/3,

90
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,660
so that equal to minus 1/2. And that is choice B.

91
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:47,460
Next problem,99. On a scale

92
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,620
that measures the intensity of a certain phenomenon,

93
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,030
a reading of n plus 1 corresponds to an intensity

94
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,660
that is 10 times the intensity corresponding to

95
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,800
a reading of n.

96
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,160
So n plus 1 is equal to 10 times the reading of just an n.

97
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,500
On that scale,the intensity corresponding to a reading of 8

98
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,390
is how many times as great as the intensity corresponding

99
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:21,110
to reading of 3? So if you call a reading of 3,I don't know,

100
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,850
let's call that a 1.

101
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,240
A reading of 4 is going to be 10 times the reading of 3.

102
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,680
A reading of 5 is going to be 10 times that,so 100.

103
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,650
A reading of 6 is going to be 10 times that,or 1,000.

104
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,650
A reading of 7 is going to be 10 times that,or 10,000.

105
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,960
And then a reading of 8 would be 10 times that,

106
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:50,330
so it would be 100,000. Which is not one of the choices.

107
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,500
Let me make sure I'm reading that.

108
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,640
On a scale that measures the intensity of certain phenomenon,

109
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,230
a reading of n plus 1 corresponds to an intensity

110
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,820
that is 10 times the intensity corresponding to

111
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,580
a reading of n.

112
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,700
So a reading of 4 is 10 times the intensity of a reading of 3

113
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,880
and a reading of 5 is 10 times that. Fine.

114
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,250
On that scale,the intensity corresponding to a reading of 8

115
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,970
is how many times as great as the intensity corresponding

116
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,870
to a reading of 3?

117
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,370
A reading of 4 would be 10 times as great,a reading of 5

118
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,400
would be 100 times as great,a reading of 6 would be 1,000

119
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,600
times as great.

120
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,950
Oh yeah,100,000,which is 10 to the fifth.

121
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,110
10 to the fifth power. Five 0's,so that is choice C.

122
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,950
Confusing myself unnecessarily, and I'm out of time.

123
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,400
See you in the next video. Let me stop this one.
