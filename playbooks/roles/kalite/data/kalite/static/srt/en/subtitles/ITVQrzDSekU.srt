1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,990
Now that have a basic understanding of what a ratio

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,120
is, let's see if we can tackle some more advanced problems.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,240
So, I have a classroom.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,960
It's got fifty-five students in it.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,570
fifty-five students.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,960
And I also know that the ratio of boys to girls, the ratio of

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,380
I'll write it this way, boys to girls is four:seven.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,490
What I want to know is, how many girls do I need to add.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:44,500
So, how many girls need to add, or do I need to add, do I need

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:57,350
to add, for the ratio, for the ratio to become one:two.

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,170
one:two.

12
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,200
And this is the ratio of boys to girls.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm not switching the ratio on you.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,110
So, right now for every four boys, I have seven girls.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,470
I want to add some girls so that the ratio becomes for

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,540
every boy, I have two girls.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,870
So how can you do this?

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,610
Well, just going back to the basic ratio video, the first

19
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,130
thing we can do we, know the total number of students.

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,710
And we know the ratio.

21
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,470
So maybe it'll help us to figure out the number of boys

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,640
and girls we have right now.

23
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,190
So our current ratio is four:seven.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,650
So boys, boys, to girls, right now is equal to four:seven.

25
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,580
That means -- what does that mean?

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,810
That means for every, if you add up these two.

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:51,990
For every eleven students there are four boys and seven girls.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,940
There are four boys, four boys and seven girls.

29
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,370
That's what this ratio tells us.

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,150
You give me eleven students of this -- you could split

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,040
this classroom into a bunch of groups.

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,550
And for every group of eleven, you're going to have four boys

33
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,430
and seven girls that's all that tells me.

34
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,770
For every eleven students, four boys and seven girls.

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,830
If you split them, every group has the same number

36
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,250
of boys and girls.

37
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,670
Now, how many groups of eleven students there are?

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,500
So there are fifty-five students.

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,760
We have fifty-five students total.

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,120
And we're breaking them into groups of eleven.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,110
And every group will have the same number

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,650
of boys and of girls.

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,360
So we have eleven groups.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,520
Sorry, if we divide by eleven students per group.

45
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,390
Students per group.

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,770
So how many groups of eleven students do we have?

47
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,690
That means we have five groups of eleven students.

48
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:04,240
five groups of eleven students.

49
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,000
And we've done this drill before.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Every group has four boys and it has seven girls.

51
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,590
So we have five groups.

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,150
five groups each of them has four boys, that means we have five

53
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,450
times four, which is equal to twenty boys.

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,690
And we have five times seven, we have five groups, five times seven,

55
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,370
each group has seven girls.

56
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Of girls.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,730
So that's equal to thirty-five girls.

58
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,830
And the numbers add up.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,990
twenty plus thirty-five is fifty-five.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,180
And twenty to thirty-five, twenty to thirty-five, is equal to four:seven.

61
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,400
So it all works out.

62
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,480
So that's what we have right now.

63
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,700
Now, we're going to add to girls to the classroom

64
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,470
to change the ratio.

65
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,460
So let's do this.

66
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,890
So right now we have twenty boys.

67
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,350
We have twenty boys.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,840
And we have thirty-five girls.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,120
We just figure that out.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,580
And I'm going to add some girls to the classroom.

71
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,750
So I'm going to add some girls to the classroom And my new

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,100
ratio, after I add these g girls to the classroom, my new

73
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,360
ratio is going to be one:two.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,820
one:two.

75
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,040
So I have an equation I have one unknown, I

76
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,140
can just solve for it.

77
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,170
You can almost do this one in your head.

78
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,440
twenty is to what, one is to two as twenty as to what?

79
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,230
You could say, oh, twenty is -- one is one / two of twenty, twenty is one / two of forty.

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,740
So you could say, oh, it's forty.

81
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,390
So g would be equal to five.

82
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,610
That's how you would solve it in your head.

83
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,940
If you want to do it algebraically, you

84
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,240
could cross-multiply.

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,270
So you get thirty-five plus g times one.

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,170
So you get thirty-five plus g is equal to two times twenty.

87
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,260
Is equal to forty, which is essentially what

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,940
we did in our head.

89
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,350
We said, hey, this thing has to be equal to forty.

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,580
So, if you subtract thirty-five from both sides, you

91
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,360
get g is equal to five.

92
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,950
So if you add five girls to your classroom, you're going

93
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,530
to have forty girls.

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,100
So then you'd have forty girls.

95
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
And you have twenty boys.

96
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,550
And your ratio is twenty:forty, which is two:four, which is

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,480
the same thing is one:two.

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
And we've done our problem.
