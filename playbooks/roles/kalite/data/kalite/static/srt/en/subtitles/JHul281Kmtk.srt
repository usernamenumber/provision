1
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:11,409
This is a very silly painting

2
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:19,893
I see a bottom af a woman's dress and a dog on a leash

3
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:28,693
It looks kind of silly, but maybe the way an which these silly things are painted is not so silly

4
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,027
maybe its silly

5
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:32,858
its an italian futurist work

6
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:42,109
Giacomo Balla

7
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:55,077
by a man named Philippo Thomaso Marinetti

8
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:56,076
Thought that most things in the countrz were not so very modern, full with museums and librarys

9
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,226
classical sculptures

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,760
we should focus on culture and contemporary life

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,926
and what arts defining elements and motion and speed are on of those

12
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,376
didnt he talked about destructing a museum

13
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:22,376
he did
