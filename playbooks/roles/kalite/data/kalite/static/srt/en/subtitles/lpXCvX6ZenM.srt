1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:09,463
We're on part B. The region R is rotated about the x-axis to form a solid. Find the volume V of the solid in terms of k.

2
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:17,329
So this is our region R, and it's going to be rotated around the x-axis... it's going to be rotated around the x-axis to form a solid.

3
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:24,080
So that solid's going to look something like this: It's going to look like this- this is going to be this end of the solid when it's rotated around,

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,938
and it's going to look something like this. My best attempt to draw our solid.

5
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:40,079
It's going to be... and then that side's going to look something like that; it'll look a little bit like a loudspeaker. Let me shade it in a little bit.

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,500
So that's going to be our solid and you can imagine... you can imagine that maybe this is... this right over here is our y-axis.

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:57,892
That is our y-axis, and then going straight through the centre of the solid... straight through the centre of the solid you have your x-axis.

8
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:03,396
and let me just... even... if the solid was slightly transparent you would see the other side of this

9
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,165
opening right over here. The x-axis goes straight through the centre.

10
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:11,620
So how do we find the volume of the solid? Well we can think about each of the individual discs of this

11
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,742
solid right over here. So think about it this way: let's take a disc right over here.

12
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,277
Take this disc right over here.

13
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:23,575
So that you can imagine this little bit of a cross-section, it's a little bit of a cross-section of

14
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:28,593
this solid so this disc right over here is going to have some area.

15
00:01:28,593 --> 00:01:31,260
It's going to have some surface and then it's going to have some depth.

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:38,478
You can imagine the depth is the edge of the quarter while the surface area is kind of the face of the quarter;

17
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:43,545
the area of the face of a quarter. So what's going to be the volume of this white disc right over here?

18
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:51,463
Well it's going to be the surface area of the disc times the depth. So what is the surface area?

19
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:58,146
Well surface area of a circle is pi times the radius squared. It's pi times the radius squared so it's going

20
00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:02,278
to be pi times... what's this radius? What's this radius?

21
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:08,478
Well the radius is the height between the x-axis and the function, so this radius is e to the 2x power.

22
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:20,813
So the area of each of these discs at this value of x is going to be pi times (e to the 2x) squared,

23
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:26,579
and then if we want the volume of this entire disc we then multiply the area times the depth,

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,063
so times dx.

25
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:34,249
So this would be the volume of this little disc over here, that has a very small, infinitessimally wide

26
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:39,814
depth, but what we want to do is sum all of these discs. We want to do... we want to have a bunch of

27
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:44,034
these discs. And we want to sum up all of them so we want to take the infinite sum of these infinitely

28
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:50,797
thin discs. So essentially we're just going to take the sum of all of these from x is equal to zero,

29
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:59,252
all the way to x is equal to k. Right, because this right over here, this is x = k, this is x = 0,

30
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:02,345
we take the sum of all the discs, we will get our actual volume.

31
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:08,414
So we can actually evaluate this integral analytically, it's not too bad. Because e to the ... let me rewrite it...

32
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:18,949
pi times... (e to the 2x) squared is e to the (4x) - just 2x times 2. And then if we want to take the

33
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,063
integral - you might be able to do this just by inspection - but if you want to say, "Hey look, I have a little function here

34
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:28,504
I want it's derivative sitting here", what we can do - we can multiply this expression by four;

35
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:33,335
we can also divide it by four. If you multiply something by four and divide it by four you haven't changed its value -

36
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:39,070
you've multiplied it by one. But what this does is it givs us, if you let me rewrite it a little bit, so this is

37
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:51,543
we can rewrite this as (pi over 4) times four times e to the 4x. I just rewrote this - I multiplied and divided by four.

38
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:57,831
And the reason why I did that is so that we have the derivative of 4x is sitting right over here, we

39
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:03,146
have this four. Pi over 4 is constant so we can actually take it out of the integral, and so we can say

40
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:09,811
this expression right over here is the same as... is the same thing as this expression right over here.

41
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:16,547
(pi/4) times the integral from zero to k of (4 e to the 4x) dx.

42
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:22,724
And so... the whole reason I multiplied and divided by four is: I have something here; I have its derivative.

43
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:28,829
So I can really just pretend like this is e to the x: I take its... I guess you could say you take the

44
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:34,084
[derivative with respect to] - or you could take the integral or the antiderivative with respect to 4x.

45
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:41,128
So this - the inside is e to the 4x. And you can verify: if you take the derivative of e to the 4x,

46
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:44,580
it is the derivative of 4x, which is 4, times (e to the 4x).

47
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,414
So this right here is the antiderivative of that, and we're going to evaluate it...

48
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:57,746
we're going to evaluate it from zero to k. And all of this times pi over four.

49
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:04,415
So when you evaluate it at k, it's e to the 4k.

50
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:13,812
So that's pi/4 times: e to the 4k minus e to the (four times zero), which is e to the zero, which is [minus] 1.

51
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:20,663
So this is our volume: (pi/4) times [e^(4k) -1]. And so that is part B. We did that.

52
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:27,430
Now part C - I think we have time for this. The volume, V, found in part B changes as k changes.

53
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,203
If dk... if the derivative of k with respect to t is one third, determine the derivative of V with respect to t

54
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:37,579
when k is one-half. So this is straight up from the chain rule

55
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:43,646
So the chain rule will tell us... and if you view differentials as just very very small numbers it actually

56
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,081
just seems like a little bit of common sense...

57
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:51,062
The rate of change of V, so this very small change in V with respect to a very small change in t

58
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:57,997
is equal to a very small change in V with respect to a very small change in k, times

59
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:05,479
times a very small change in k divided by a very small change in t.

60
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,013
Or: the derivative of v with respect to t is equal to the derivative of V with respect to k

61
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:12,340
times the derivative of k with respect to t.

62
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,514
And the reason why I said this made sense if you view a differential as a small number is:

63
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:21,882
You would... and that's not a very rigorous way of doing it but it's a good kind of common sense way

64
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:26,081
of just thinking about things... is that these guys would cancel out if these <i>were</i> numbers, and then

65
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:31,497
you would have dV/dt on both sides. So that's why I said this is a slightly common sense -

66
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,252
you can kind of view it that way.

67
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:35,531
But this essentially gives us everything we need to know:

68
00:06:35,531 --> 00:06:44,392
We need to solve for dV/dt. They already gave us dk/dt = 1/3 when k = 1/2,

69
00:06:44,392 --> 00:06:51,747
So they're already telling us the rate of change of k with respect to t, we already know that this thing

70
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:58,533
right over here is going to be 1/3, and we can figure out the derivative of V with respect to k very easily:

71
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:01,881
We have V as a function of k right over here, so let's figure that out.

72
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:13,949
So the derivative of V with respect to k is equal to pi/4 times the derivative in here.

73
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,948
The derivative of this is just 4(e^4k), derivative of -1 is just zero.

74
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:26,114
So e... this is times four... e to the 4k is the derivative. These guys cancel out,

75
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:33,465
so this is equal to pi * e to the 4k, that's the derivative of V with respect to k,

76
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:40,831
we want to find it when k = 1/2, so we could write V' at 1/2,

77
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:49,866
or when k=1/2, dV/dk is going to be equal to pi times e to the (4 times 1/2),

78
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:58,213
which is pi * (e squared). So this part right over here is pi*e^2.

79
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:02,914
And so the derivative of V with respect to t when k is equal to 1/2, and

80
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:11,326
and the derivative of k with respect to t is 1/3, is going to be just pi*e^2 times 1/3.

81
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:19,114
So let me just rewrite it over here. So dV/dt is going to be equal to 1/3 * this.

82
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:23,176
Or we could write pi e^2 over three.

83
00:08:23,176 --> 99:59:59,999
And we're done! :-)
