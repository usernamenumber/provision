1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Evaluate 1x when x is equal to -1,0,and 1.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,933
So let's do the scenario x is equal to 1.

3
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:16,067
So 1x becomes 1 times.. one-which is now negative 1

4
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:20,333
So it's one times negative one.

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,267
There a couple of ways to think about it.

6
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:25,467
One times anything is going to be that anything.

7
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:32,133
So one times negative one is going to be equal to negative one

8
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,000
Another way you could have thought about it is that

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,267
you could just look at the absolute value of each number

10
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:39,267
so you say one times one is one

11
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,333
they have different signs so it's going to be negative

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,133
which have gotten you the same answer either way

13
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,800
So now with the scenario that x is equal to 0

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
So one times x is going to be the same thing as one times 0

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,600
We subsitute the 0 for x.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,000
So once again,one times anything is going to be that anything.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,667
This is going to become 0

18
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,933
Another way to think about this is that

19
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,333
0 times anything is going to become 0.

20
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:09,933
So either one of the ways of thinking about it would have gotten you the same answer.

21
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:16,200
Actually we can even write 1*x =x

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,415
So really when you value these numbers in x

23
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:21,800
x is equal to -1,0 or1

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,267
It's going to equal that number

25
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:27,067
one times anything is going to be that anything right overthere.

26
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:38,400
To make it clear 0 times anything is 0 (0x=0)

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,267
Just for good measure we kind or already went through the answers.

28
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:46,067
But let's try x is equal to 1

29
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:52,200
So this will give us 1 times 1 which you probably learned a while ago.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
1 times anything is going to become that number!

31
00:01:53,800 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's equal to 1
