1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,720
A lot of what we do with Laplace
transforms, taking

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,070
them and taking their
inverse, it's a

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,260
lot of pattern matching.

5
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,380
And it shouldn't just be a
mechanical thing, and that's

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,130
why I've gone through the
exercise of showing

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,270
you why they work.

8
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,650
But in order to just kind of
make sure we don't get

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,370
confused, I think it might be
useful to review a little bit

10
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,890
of everything that we've
learned so far.

11
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,070
So in the last video, we saw
that the Laplace transform--

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,760
well, let me just
write something.

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,930
The Laplace transform of f of
t, let me just get some

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,210
notation down, and we can write
that as big capital F of

15
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,210
s, and I've told you
that before.

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,090
And so given that, in the last
video I showed you that if we

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
have to deal with the unit step
function, so if I said,

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,810
look, the Laplace transform of
the unit step function, it

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,690
becomes 1 at some value c times
some shifted function f

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,420
of t minus c, in the last video,
we saw that this is

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:01,530
just equal to e to the minus cs
times the Laplace transform

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,079
of just this function right
there, so times the F of s.

23
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,005
   

24
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,780
And it's really important not
to get this confused with

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,530
another Laplace transform
property or rule, or whatever

26
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,310
you want to call it, that
we figured out.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,840
I think it was one of the videos
that I made last year,

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,690
but if you're just following
these in order I think it's

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,870
three or four videos ago.

30
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:31,000
And that one told us that the
Laplace transform of e to the

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,710
at, times f of t, that this is
equal to-- and I want to make

32
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,340
this distinction very clear.

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,740
Here we shifted the f of t
and we got just kind of a

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,580
regular F of s.

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,660
In this situation, when we
multiply it times a e to the

36
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:57,480
positive at, we end up shifting
the actual transform.

37
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,480
So this becomes F
of s minus a.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,720
And these two rules, or
properties, or whatever you

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,690
want to call them, they're
very easy to

40
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,750
confuse with each other.

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,509
So we're going to do a couple
of examples that we're going

42
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,040
to have to figure out which
one of these two apply.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,350
Let's write all the other stuff
that we learned as well.

44
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,740
The very first thing we learned
was that the Laplace

45
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,740
transform of 1 was
equal to 1/s.

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,270
We know that that's a pretty
straightforward one, easy to

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,320
prove to yourself.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,930
And more generally, we learned
that the Laplace transform of

49
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,330
t to the n, where n is a
positive integer, it equaled n

50
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:42,120
factorial over s to
the n plus 1.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,500
And then we had our
trig functions

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,150
that we've gone over.

53
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,340
Let me do this in a
different color.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,130
I'll do it right here.

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:58,980
The Laplace transform of sine
of at is equal to a over s

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,530
squared, plus a squared.

57
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,760
And the Laplace transform of the
cosine of at is equal to s

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,660
over s squared plus a squared.

59
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,330
And you'll be amazed by how far
we can go with just what

60
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,980
I've written here.

61
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,020
In future videos, we're going
to broaden our toolkit even

62
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,610
further, but just these right
here, you can already do a

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,170
whole set of Laplace transforms
and inverse Laplace

64
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,330
transforms. So let's
try to do a few.

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,435
So let's say I were to give
you the Laplace transform.

66
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,410
And you know, this is
just the hard part.

67
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,830
I think you know how to solve
a differential equation, if

68
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,360
you know how to take the
Laplace transforms

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
and go back and forth.

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,860
The hard part is just
recognizing or inverting your

71
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,640
Laplace transforms. So let's
say we had the Laplace

72
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,760
transform of some
function F of s.

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:56,260
Let's say it's 3 factorial over
s minus 2 to the fourth.

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,210
Now, your pattern matching, or
your pattern recognition part

75
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,810
of your brain, should
immediately say, look, I have

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,880
a Laplace transform of something
that has a factorial

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,860
in it, and it's over
an exponent.

78
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,770
This must be something
related to this

79
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,540
thing right here, right?

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,240
If I just had the Laplace
transform-- let me write that

81
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,670
down-- the Laplace transform
of-- you see a 3 factorial and

82
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,380
a fourth power, so it looks
like n is equal to 3.

83
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,200
So if you write the Laplace
transform of t to the 3, this

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,530
rule that we showed right here,
this means that it would

85
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:38,550
be equal to 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

86
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,430
Now, this thing isn't
exactly this thing.

87
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,530
They're not quite
the same thing.

88
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,150
You know, I'm doing this to
instruct you, but I find

89
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,210
these, when I'm actually doing
them on an exam-- I remember

90
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,370
when I did them when I first
learned this, I would actually

91
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,290
go through this step because you
definitely don't want to

92
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,690
make a careless mistake and you
definitely want to make

93
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,610
sure you have a good handle
on what you're doing.

94
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,970
So you're like, OK, it's
something related to this, but

95
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,780
what's the difference between
this expression right here and

96
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,020
the expression that we're trying
to take the inverse

97
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,720
Laplace transform of,
and this one here?

98
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,310
Well, we've shifted our s.

99
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:22,600
If we call this expression right
here F of s, then what's

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,110
this expression?

101
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,200
This expression right here
is F of s minus 2.

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,100
   

103
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,410
So what are we dealing
with here?

104
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,730
So you see here, you have
a shifted F of s.

105
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,760
So in this case, a would
be equal to 2.

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,180
So this is the Laplace transform
of e to the at times

107
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,390
our f of t.

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,660
So let me write this down.

109
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,850
This is the Laplace transform
of e to the-- and what's a?

110
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,440
a is what we shifted by.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,170
It's what we shifted by minus
a, so you have a positive a,

112
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,060
so e to the 2t times the
actual function.

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,415
If this was just an F of s,
what would f of t be?

114
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:15,550
Well, we figured out, it's t the
3, t to the third power.

115
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,260
So the Laplace transform of
this is equal to that.

116
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,250
Or we could write that the
inverse Laplace transform of 3

117
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,600
factorial over s minus 2 to the
fourth is equal to e to

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,300
the 2t times t to the third.

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,420
Now, if that seemed confusing
to you, you

120
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,670
can kind of go forward.

121
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,150
   

122
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,730
Let's go the other direction,
and maybe this will make it a

123
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,250
little bit clearer for you.

124
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,570
So let's go from
this direction.

125
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,390
If I have to take the Laplace
transform of this thing, I'd

126
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,370
say, OK, well, the Laplace
transform of t to

127
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,620
the third is easy.

128
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,340
   

129
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,570
I think the tool isn't working
right there properly.

130
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,630
Let me scroll up a little bit.

131
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,540
So I could write
it right here.

132
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,385
So if I wanted to figure out the
Laplace transform of e to

133
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:12,600
the 2t times t to the third,
I'll say, well, you know, this

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,950
e to the 2t, I remember that
it shifts something.

135
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:20,050
So if I know that the Laplace
transform of t the third, this

136
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:20,810
is an easy one.

137
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,710
It's equal to 3 factorial
over s to the fourth.

138
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,160
That's 3 plus 1.

139
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,780
Then the Laplace transform of e
to the 2t times t the third

140
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,650
is going to be this shifted.

141
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,570
This is equal to F of s.

142
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,600
Then this is going to
be f of s minus 2.

143
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,550
So what's F of s minus 2?

144
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,550
It's going to be equal to 3
factorial over s minus 2 to

145
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,580
the fourth.

146
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,420
I think you're already getting
an appreciation that the

147
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,480
hardest thing about these
Laplace transform problems are

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,380
really kind of all of these
shifts and kind of recognizing

149
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,410
the patterns and recognizing
what's your a, and what's your

150
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,220
c, and being very careful about
it so you don't make a

151
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,070
careless mistake.

152
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,430
And I think doing a lot of
examples probably helps a lot,

153
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,500
so let's do a couple of more
to kind of make sure things

154
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,710
really get hammered home
in your brain.

155
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,840
So let's try this
one right here.

156
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,640
This looks a little bit
more complicated.

157
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,030
They give us that the Laplace
transform of some function is

158
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:32,070
equal to 2 times s minus 1 times
e to the minus 2s, all

159
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:39,940
of that over s squared
minus 2s plus 2.

160
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,600
Now this looks very daunting.

161
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:41,990
How do you do this?

162
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,680
I have an e here.

163
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,049
I have something shifted here.

164
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,260
I have this polynomial in
the denominator here.

165
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,720
What can I do with this?

166
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,080
So the first thing, when I look
at these polynomials in

167
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,620
the denominator, I say can
I factor it somehow?

168
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,800
Can I factor it fairly simply?

169
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,830
And actually, in the exams
that you'll find in

170
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,280
differential equation class,
they'll never give you

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,920
something that's factorable
into these weird numbers.

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
It tends to be integers.

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,200
So you see, OK, what
two numbers?

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,060
They have to be positive.

175
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,990
When you give their product,
you get 2.

176
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,430
And then when you add them, you
get negative 2, or they

177
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,750
could both be negative.

178
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,360
But there's no two easy
numbers, not 1 and 2.

179
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,800
None of those work.

180
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,820
So if you can't factor this
outright, the next idea is

181
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,290
maybe we could complete the
square and maybe this will

182
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,470
match one of the cosine
or the sine formulas.

183
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,280
So how can we complete the
square in this denominator?

184
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:38,640
Well, this can be rewritten
as s squared minus 2s.

185
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,010
And I'm going to put
a plus 2 out here.

186
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,230
And you can watch, I have
a bunch of videos on the

187
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,650
completing of the square,
if all of this

188
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,830
looks foreign to you.

189
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,090
And to complete the square, we
just want to turn this into a

190
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,130
perfect square.

191
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,850
So to turn this into a perfect
square-- so something when I

192
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,720
add it to itself twice becomes
minus 2, and so that when I

193
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,030
square it, when I add it to
itself twice, it becomes minus

194
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,300
2, it's minus 1.

195
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,700
And when I square it,
it'll become plus 1.

196
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,160
I can't just add plus 1
arbitrarily to some

197
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,650
expression, I have to
make it neutral.

198
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,920
So let me subtract 1.

199
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,730
I haven't changed this.

200
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,630
I added 1 and I subtracted 1.

201
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,890
A little bit of a primer on
completing the square.

202
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,610
But by doing this, I now can
call this expression right

203
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,780
here, I can now say that this
thing is s minus 1 squared.

204
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,430
And then this stuff out here,
this out here is 2 minus 1.

205
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,410
This is just plus 1.

206
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,100
So I can rewrite my entire
expression now as 2 times s

207
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,560
minus 1 times e to the minus
2s-- make sure I'm not

208
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,420
clipping off at the top-- e to
the minus 2s, all of that over

209
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,620
s minus 1 squared plus 1.

210
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,880
So a couple of interesting
things seem to

211
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,020
be happening here.

212
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,710
Let's just do a couple of test
Laplace transforms. So if a

213
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,610
Laplace transform of cosine of
t, we know that this is equal

214
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:23,050
to s over s squared plus 1,
which this kind of looks like

215
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,180
if this was an s and this
was an s squared plus 1.

216
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,960
If this was F of s,
then what is this?

217
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,130
Well, let's ignore this guy
right here for a little bit.

218
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,920
So what is it?

219
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,930
We know, actually, from
the last video.

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,720
We saw, well, what if we took
the Laplace transform of e to

221
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,540
the-- I'll call it 1t.

222
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,000
But let's say e to the-- yeah
I'll just write it e to the 1t

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,250
times cosine of t?

224
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,410
Well, then this will just
shift this Laplace

225
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,995
transform by 1.

226
00:11:56,995 --> 00:12:00,100
It will shift it by
1 to the right.

227
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,270
Wherever you see an s, you
would put an s minus a 1.

228
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,900
So this will be equal to s
minus 1 over s minus 1

229
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,200
squared plus 1.

230
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,270
We're getting close.

231
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,390
We now figured out this
part right here.

232
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,440
Now, in the previous video, I
think it was two videos ago,

233
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,040
or maybe it was the last
video, I forget.

234
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,000
Memory fails me.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,060
I showed you that if you have
the Laplace transform of the

236
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:38,970
unit step function of t times
some f of t shifted by some

237
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:50,160
value of c, then that this is
equal to e to the minus cs

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,260
times F of s.

239
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,260
OK, And this can get
very confusing.

240
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,000
This can get very confusing,
so I want to be

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,290
very careful here.

242
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,190
Let's ignore all of this.

243
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,660
I called this F of s before, but
now I'm going to backtrack

244
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,130
a little bit.

245
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,980
And let's just ignore this,
because I'm going to redefine

246
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,670
our F of s.

247
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,670
So let's just ignore
that for a second.

248
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,940
Let's define our new
f of t to be this.

249
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,260
Let's say that that is f of t.

250
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,690
Let's say f of t is equal to
e to the t cosine of t.

251
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,200
Then if you take the Laplace
transform of that, that means

252
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,850
that F of s is equal to s
minus 1 over s minus 1

253
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,050
squared plus 1.

254
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,040
Nothing fancy there.

255
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,190
I just defined our f of
t as this, and then

256
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,400
our F of s is that.

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,390
Now, we have a situation here.

258
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,880
Let's ignore the 2 here.

259
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,410
The 2 is just kind of
a scaling factor.

260
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,180
This expression right here, we
can rewrite as that expression

261
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,610
is equal to-- this
is our F of s.

262
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,600
This expression right here is
equal to 2 times our F of s

263
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,150
times e to the minus 2s.

264
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,230
Or let me just write it.

265
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,440
Let me switch the order, just
so we make it look right.

266
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,140
2 times e to the minus
2s times F of s.

267
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,720
Well, that looks just like
this if our 2 was

268
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,970
equal to our c.

269
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,000
   

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,570
So what does that tell us?

271
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,590
That tells us that the inverse
Laplace transform, if we take

272
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,660
the inverse Laplace
transform-- and

273
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,060
let's ignore the 2.

274
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,540
Let's do the inverse Laplace
transform of the whole thing.

275
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,020
The inverse Laplace transform
of this thing is going to be

276
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,070
equal to-- we can just write
the 2 there as a scaling

277
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,000
factor, 2 there times
this thing times

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,010
the unit step function.

279
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,580
What's our c?

280
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,650
You can just pattern match.

281
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,330
You have a 2 here.

282
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,780
You have a c, a minus c,
a minus 2, so c is 2.

283
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,380
The unit step function is zero
until it gets to 2 times t, or

284
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,180
of t, so, then it becomes 1
after t is equal to 2, times

285
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:19,110
our function shifted by 2.

286
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,990
So this is our inverse
Laplace transform.

287
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,950
Now, what was our function?

288
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,140
Our function was this
thing right here.

289
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,090
So if our inverse Laplace
transform of that thing that I

290
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:38,170
had written is this thing, an
f of t, f of t is equal to e

291
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,650
to the t cosine of t.

292
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,370
Then our inverse-- let me
write all of this down.

293
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,180
Let me write our big result.

294
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,470
We established that the inverse
Laplace transform of

295
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,300
that big thing that I had
written before, 2 times s

296
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:05,890
minus 1 times e to the minus 2--
sorry, e to the minus 2s

297
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:13,820
over s squared minus 2s plus 2
is equal to this thing where f

298
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,770
of t is this.

299
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:20,700
Or we could just rewrite this
as 2 times the unit step

300
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,130
function starting at 2, where
that's when it becomes

301
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,630
non-zero of t times f of t minus
2. f of t minus 2 is

302
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,190
this with t being replaced
by t minus 2.

303
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll do it in another color,
just to ease the monotony.

304
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:43,920
So it would be e to the t minus
2 cosine of t minus 2.

305
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,910
Now, you might be thinking, Sal,
you know, he must have

306
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,990
taken all these baby steps with
this problem, because

307
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,790
he's trying to explain
it to me.

308
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,370
But I'm taking baby steps with
this problem so that I myself

309
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,320
don't get confused.

310
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,750
And I think it's essential
that you do

311
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,110
take these baby steps.

312
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,320
And let's just think about
what baby steps we took.

313
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,350
And I really want
to review this.

314
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,800
This is actually a surprisingly
good problem.

315
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,930
I didn't realize it when I
first decided to do it.

316
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,020
We solved this thing.

317
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,930
We wanted to get this
denominator into some form

318
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,560
that is vaguely useful to us,
so I completed the square

319
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,940
there and then we rewrote
our Laplace transform,

320
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,770
our f of s like this.

321
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,339
And then we used a little
pattern recognition.

322
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,869
We said, look, if I take the
Laplace transform of cosine of

323
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:27,750
t, I'd get s over s
squared plus 1.

324
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,500
But this isn't s over
s squared plus 1.

325
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,180
It's s minus 1 over s minus
1 squared plus 1.

326
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,450
So we said, oh, well, that means
that we're multiplying

327
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,300
our original time
domain function.

328
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,850
We're multiplying our f of
t times e to the 1t.

329
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,200
And that's what we got there.

330
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,460
So the Laplace transform of e to
the t cosine of t became s

331
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,180
minus 1 over s minus
1 squared plus 1.

332
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,970
And then we had this e to the
minus 2s this entire time.

333
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,470
And that's where we said, hey,
if we have e to the minus 2s

334
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,610
in our Laplace transform, when
you take the inverse Laplace

335
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,760
transform, it must be the step
function times the shifted

336
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,020
version of that function.

337
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,200
And that's why I was
very careful.

338
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,320
And you had this 2 hanging out
the whole time, and I could

339
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,030
have used that any time.

340
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,710
But the simple constants
just scale.

341
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,960
A function is equal to two times
the Laplace transform of

342
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,410
that function and vice versa.

343
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,250
So the 2's are very easy to
deal with, so I kind of

344
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,470
ignored that most of the time.

345
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,780
But that's why I was
very careful.

346
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,420
I redefined f of t to be this,
F of s to be this, and said,

347
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,920
gee, if F of s is this, and if
I'm multiplying it times e to

348
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,040
the minus 2s, then what I'm
essentially doing, I'm fitting

349
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,730
this pattern right here.

350
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,070
And so the answer to my problem
is going to be the

351
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,450
unit step function-- I just
throw the 2 out there-- the 2

352
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,960
times the unit step function
times my f of t shifted by c.

353
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
And we established this was
our f of t, so we just

354
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,500
shifted it by c.

355
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,570
We shifted it by 2, and we
got our final answer.

356
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,220
So this is about as hard up to
this point as you'll see an

357
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,780
inverse Laplace transform
problem.

358
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,450
So, hopefully, you found that
pretty interesting.

359
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:14,615
