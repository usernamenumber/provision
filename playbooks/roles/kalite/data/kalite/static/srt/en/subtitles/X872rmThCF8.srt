1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,136
We're in the British Museum, and we're looking at one of the Caryatids from the Erechtheion from the

2
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:14,875
Acropolis in Athens.

3
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,269
That's a lot of information.

4
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:20,770
And a Caryatid is a human figure acting as a column.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,677
She looks like a column.

6
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:30,037
She does, her drapery falls in what almost looks like the fluting of a column, those vertical ridges.

7
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:35,936
And because she stands in contrapposto with one weight bearing leg,

8
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:41,002
which is the one that looks like a column, and one free leg so that the knee juts forward

9
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:45,507
that drapery is allowed to fall completely free of the body below.

10
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:50,590
This very subtle and very sensitively handled swayed her body, right?

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,575
The contrapposto is not just in the legs, but even in the hips,

12
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:58,173
which you can't actually see, because of all the cloth, but which were referred to.

13
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,705
We have this nice circular form around her hips...

14
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:03,643
Where the peplos just bunches.

15
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,937
Right, that tunic that she's wearing,

16
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:12,800
and that pools down around her waist, falling from her breasts in a very graceful way.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,303
It's interesting because we're talking about the sway of the body,

18
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:19,003
but by the time you get up to the capital, up to her head, she's straightened out,

19
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:20,543
and she has to be.

20
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:22,214
You know, you can really get a sense of

21
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:26,569
even the specificity, the weight, the thickness of the cloth.

22
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,242
You know, the way a peplos worked, it was pinned at the shoulders,

23
00:01:29,242 --> 00:01:32,403
but you can really get a sense that this is not a very thin fabric,

24
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,969
it's got a certain heaviness to it.

25
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,903
Kind of weight to it.

26
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:37,704
It's interesting, if you look at the porch where this came from,

27
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:43,942
there are six Caryatids altogether, four facing forward, and the two on the right

28
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:47,269
oppose the two on the left in terms of the contraposto,

29
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:51,700
I believe with the weight-bearing leg on the outside always to make it feel more stable.

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,869
This is a sort of sensitivity to...

31
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:55,437
Harmony, balance...

32
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,769
Yeah, absolutely.

33
00:01:56,769 --> 00:02:01,936
And there's, like, nobility to her that is very much what we've been seeing

34
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:07,236
when we also looked at the Parthenon sculptures again, or in 5th century BC, Greece,

35
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:14,699
the classical era and that sense of ideal perfect beauty, and nobility, and monumentality.

36
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:22,170
But I also find it really interesting, this idea of conflating an architectural element with the human body

37
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,864
because that's something that is a very ancient idea, and here it's done in the most, sort of, direct way.

38
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:34,477
Later the Romans will talk about architecture in terms of the human body.

39
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:38,068
Not only in terms of scale, but also in terms of proportion.

40
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,269
And here it's taken to the most literal, extreme.

41
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,969
And within the same room is the fabulous Ionic column, also from the Erechtheion,

42
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:52,444
which is very graceful, and grows more slender as it rises towards the top,

43
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:56,924
with the lovely Ionic capital, with decorative carving underneath.

44
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:04,170
But having this column here is a really important reminder of the scale of those buildings in the Acropolis,

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,407
because when you're standing in the Museum you forget...

46
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,401
How big these buildings were.

47
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,569
...the scale of these buildings on top of a hill.

48
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:16,437
In Athens, in the way, there's a nice skylight above it, begins to give you a sense of

49
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:19,900
what it's like in natural light to see the stone.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,603
And this is, as you said, an Ionic column, which is much more slender, much more graceful column

51
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:32,800
than the sort of heavy Doric, the massiveness that we see in the Parthenon, which is just across the way on the Acropolis.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,769
And sometimes, and I think this is a little sexist, but sometimes this order, the Ionic,

53
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,403
is referred to as the, kind of, more feminine.

54
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,436
Right, more elegant, more graceful, more decorative.

55
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:48,969
And, of course, the female figures are replacing the actual columns, so this is kind of the synthesis of those two.

56
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:54,269
And the lovely fluting that makes this wonderful play of light and dark across the column.

57
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,635
Fluting and, unlike the Doric, there's a base.

58
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:00,036
The column doesn't rise directly out of the stylobate.

59
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:04,036
There's this sort of footing, and of course that beautiful scrolled capital.
