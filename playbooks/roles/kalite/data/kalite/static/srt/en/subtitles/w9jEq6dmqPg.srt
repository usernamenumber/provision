1
00:00:02,067 --> 00:00:05,800
Identify all the rays shown in the image below.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
and this is a reminder what a ray is.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,000
A ray start at some point and then goes on forever in some direction.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,533
In order to find a ray you need that point that you're starting off on

5
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,800
so let's that point over there is called X

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,600
and then you need another point that sits on the ray

7
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,533
and the ray is just keep going beyond, we

8
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:35,533
will name that point as "Y" and we will call the ray "XY"

9
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:41,600
It starts in "X" and keeps going in the direction of "y"

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,533
for ever, it crosses "y" and keeps going further

11
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:50,667
we need the second point to specify the direction

12
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:56,200
in which the ray is going.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,867
So, lets identify all the rays shown in the image

14
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:05,200
below, we can start anywhere, we will start at

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,800
point J, the only line segment we have starting from J

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:21,667
is JH going up, goes upto H and keeps on going

17
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:27,467
in that direction beyond H, ray JH, starting from J

18
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:31,267
going through H and going beyond it forever

19
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:37,800
now if we go to H, there is no ray HJ as the line ends

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,267
in J and does not keep going beyond J, there is no

21
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:47,333
ray H as it is just one point, just usiing one point,

22
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:51,600
we cannot say it as a ray. now looking at our diagram

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:08,067
the only ray is JH. Now let us look at the other points.

24
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:15,067
If we look at point C, once again there is no point

25
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:21,533
after C to specify it as a ray, we can have a ray CE,

26
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:27,600
starts at C goes through E and goes on for ever,

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,600
you can also have a ray starting at C, going through F

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,933
and going on forever, CE & CF are the same rays

29
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:49,133
as F sits on ray CE and E sits of ray CF,

30
00:02:49,133 --> 00:03:02,933
so CE & CF are the same rays,

31
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:08,067
now lets think about what we can do from point E,

32
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:12,333
We can start at point E , go in the direction of C

33
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:17,600
and go beyond C, so it is a ray, ray EC

34
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,200
you could start in E and go in the direction of A and go

35
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,067
beyond A, so EA is a ray, and we can start at E and

36
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:30,200
go in the direction of F and go beyond F, that is ray EF

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:39,267
ray EF and ray CF are different as the

38
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:46,200
starting points are different

39
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,667
Now lets go to point F. To the left of point F

40
00:03:53,667 --> 00:04:00,667
there is no other point. We can look at the right,

41
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,533
we can have ray FE, start at F go through E and

42
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:07,800
beyond E, you can have ray FC, start at F

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:17,667
go through C and beyond C that is teh same thing as FE

44
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:21,933
ray FE and ray FC are the same as the point E

45
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:33,200
is on ray FC, then finally we have not focussed on point A

46
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,133
you may think there is ray AE, but the line does not

47
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:44,800
go beyond E, so it is not a ray, to the top of A

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
there is no other point, so there is no ray there either

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,933
that is all the rays based on the points specified.

50
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:59,067
If they had given us a point over there, we could have

51
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:32,133
had other rays,

52
00:05:32,133 --> 99:59:59,999
There are 6 rays in this problem
