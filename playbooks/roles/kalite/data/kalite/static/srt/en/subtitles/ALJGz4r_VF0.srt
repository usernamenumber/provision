1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,400
In the video on the Fourth
Coalition, I forgot to add to

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,810
one super important
consequence of

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,810
the Treaties of Tilsit.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,240
And especially the Treaty
of Tilsit with Prussia.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,560
I already talked about that it
was all about carving up

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,260
Prussia, and humiliating
Prussia.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,440
And really removing it from
the status of one the

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,940
preeminent powers.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,320
And all I talked about was the
loss of the territories of

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,710
Prussia west of the Elbe.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,800
And that's about that
area right there.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,850
But just as important
as that, the

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,050
Polish holdings of Prussia.

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:45,340
So all of this area right over
here, this also was removed

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,500
from Prussia and became a
French satellite state.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,760
It became the Duchy of Warsaw.

18
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,160
So I just really want
to emphasize.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,300
The Treaty of Tilsit, I only
emphasized kind of what

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,240
happened on the western side
of Prussia, but the eastern

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,020
side of Prussia also
got carved up.

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,730
And Prussia essentially
lost half of its size.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,150
So it's very dramatic
humiliation for Prussia at the

24
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,250
end of the Treaty of Tilsit.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,740
Or the Treaties of Tilsit.

26
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,780
Now with that out of the way,
we talked about in the last

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,510
video, that at the end of the
Fourth Coalition, Napoleon was

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,740
kind of near the peak
of his power.

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,360
He'd kind of done everything
right.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,370
He had this kind of steady
upward momentum, or France had

31
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,900
a steady upward momentum
in its power.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,200
But what we're going to see in
this video, at least the

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
beginnings of the downfall
of Napoleon.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,670
And it's not going to
be obvious when

35
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,570
you look at the territory.

36
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,390
Because from a territorial point
of view, you're going to

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,040
see in this video that he's
actually gaining territory.

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,430
But he is going to start doing
some of the actions that end

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,190
up undermining him.

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,500
So we talked about in the last
video, we talked about this

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,950
whole notion of the Continental
System, where

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,800
Napoleon was obsessed with
people on the continent of

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,580
Europe boycotting England,
not trading with England.

44
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,900
And he figured this is the only
way that he could really

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,800
undermine England's dominance
on the ocean.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,480
Or eventually maybe even
undermine England generally.

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,390
So as we said, in the Treaties
of Tilsit he got Russia to

48
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,850
participate in the Continental
System.

49
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,100
So he wanted everyone
to buy into it.

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,110
And one party that, at this
point, we're talking about--

51
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,390
we're in 1807 now-- one party
that wasn't all that keen in

52
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,240
participating in the

53
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,420
Continental System was Portugal.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,600
That's Portugal right there.

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,050
So Napoleon goes and chats--
well they didn't chat

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,280
directly-- but he gets
the agreement

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,590
of the King of Spain.

58
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,790
This is Charles IV, and he's
going to look like a bit of a

59
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,040
fool and this video.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,480
   

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,320
And Napoleon says, hey Charles,
let's go in there,

62
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,740
let's go into Portugal, that
little upstart country that

63
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,980
doesn't want to participate
in the Continental System.

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,970
You and me, we'll
invade together.

65
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,870
We'll bring them into kind of
our realm of influence.

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,960
And we can both kind of pillage
the lands and get the

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,910
wealth of Portugal.

68
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,840
Charles IV, he's all
up for this.

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,870
So a combined French and Spanish
force invade Portugal.

70
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,690
So in 1807, this is
the end of 1807,

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,700
it's actually in October.

72
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:33,980
In October, you have a combined
French and Spanish

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,060
invasion of Portugal.

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,570
And they are able to take
Portugal, but we're going to

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,570
see that it's reasonably
temporary.

76
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,290
Now I just mentioned that this
guy is going to look like the

77
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,760
fool of this video.

78
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
And the reason is, because
with the excuse of

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,100
reinforcements, obviously to get
to Portugal, you have to

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,820
go through Spain.

81
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,700
So with the excuse of sending in
reinforcements, Napoleon in

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,410
1808-- and now we're talking
about early 1808, in

83
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,480
particular in March.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,980
So with the excuse of sending
in reinforcements to support

85
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,610
the Portugal campaign, and Spain
is like your my ally,

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,440
sure, send those hundreds of
thousands of troops right

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,250
through our territory.

88
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,220
We're not going to
worry about it.

89
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,250
And with that excuse, Napoleon
was able to send 100,000

90
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,950
troops and occupy Madrid.

91
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,220
   

92
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,570
So this is one of
those lessons of

93
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,490
never get too greedy.

94
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,620
This guy got greedy, wanted
to help Napoleon.

95
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,710
Or I guess the other lesson
is be careful who

96
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,960
your friends are.

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,020
This guy wanted to invade
Portugal, but the side effect

98
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,960
of it is that Madrid
gets occupied.

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
And that actually he
gets dethrowned.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,650
And so you have this situation
here, the French are now in

101
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,010
control of Spain.

102
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:59,440
In May of 1808-- and this is
really going to be the first

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,010
little spark that is kind of
the downfall of Napoleon.

104
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:12,510
In May 2, 1808, a popular
uprising starts in Madrid.

105
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,990
Dos de Mayo.

106
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,136
So a popular uprising
in Madrid.

107
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:20,900
   

108
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,860
And at the same time, a little
bit after that--

109
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,350
So you can imagine, this is
a hugely tumultuous time.

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,030
You have this occupation of
Portugal with the excuse of

111
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,640
reinforcements in March.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,725
The French troops
occupy Madrid.

113
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:39,780
   

114
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,860
Then in May-- so a couple of
months later-- a popular

115
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,600
uprising starts in Madrid.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,880
This leads to popular uprisings
throughout Spain.

117
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,490
But at the very same time as
this-- this is a little bit

118
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,890
after the uprising in May--
Napoleon says, oh, this is

119
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,250
just a little uprising, I'm
still in control of Spain.

120
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,630
He appoints his other brother--
remember, there's

121
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,650
this whole business he's putting
his brothers in charge

122
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,860
of different parts
of the Empire.

123
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,290
He puts his brother Joseph, he
appoints his brother Joseph--

124
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,890
or you could kind of say-- he
inserts his brother Joseph as

125
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,140
the King of Spain.

126
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:26,410
   

127
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,410
So this is all in kind
of early, mid-1808.

128
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,110
Spain is in all of
this turmoil.

129
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,710
A new king has been appointed,
who is Napoleon's brother.

130
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,350
The old king is no
longer in charge.

131
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,060
You have this ongoing
battle in Portugal.

132
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,960
They don't have a firm hold
on Portugal just yet.

133
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,680
And in the rest of 1808, the
uprising that occurs

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,770
throughout Spain is actually
pretty successful in enforcing

135
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,810
the French troops to retreat.

136
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:07,490
   

137
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,770
And a major, I guess, aspect of
this uprising is it's one

138
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,780
of the first real national
uprisings in history.

139
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,000
It's people saying we are
Spanish, we do not like being

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,940
controlled by the French.

141
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,240
We do not like how they have
treated our royalty.

142
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,870
We as a nation are
going to rise up.

143
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,040
And the other interesting aspect
of this whole uprising

144
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,770
that starts in Madrid with Dos
de Mayo, but then it starts

145
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,120
continuing throughout the whole
nation, is the idea of

146
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,370
guerrilla warfare.

147
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,480
   

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,730
Not gorilla warfare.

149
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,810
   

150
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,360
And this comes from the Spanish
for little war.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,220
Not from the large ape.

152
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,280
And what it implies, you
probably heard the word on the

153
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,330
news before, is kind of a
non-conventional style of

154
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,800
fighting, where small little
groups kind of engage their

155
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,740
enemy in very nontraditional
styles.

156
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,200
So it becomes a very painful--
at least for it Napoleon's

157
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,800
forces-- it became very
difficult fighting these

158
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,360
non-conventional battles
all over Spain.

159
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,930
So they were able to force
the French to retreat.

160
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,530
Napoleon says, gee,
you know what?

161
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,630
If you want a job well done,
you've got to do it yourself.

162
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,910
So Napoleon comes in at the end
of the year, and then he

163
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,530
retakes Madrid.

164
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:39,340
So December of 1808, Napoleon
back in Madrid.

165
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,700
   

166
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,670
Now, you might say all
is fine and well.

167
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,220
Now Napoleon is back here.

168
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,470
He has firm control of Spain.

169
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,130
But not everything is good.

170
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,170
Because as you could imagine,
there's all these other

171
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,050
characters here that keep
forming coalitions for and

172
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,460
against Napoleon.

173
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Even when they say that they're
allied, you know that

174
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,630
in the back of their minds they
can't wait until they can

175
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,770
declare the next war
on Napoleon.

176
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:19,990
So in 1809-- let me write this
down-- Austria declares war.

177
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,630
   

178
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,410
And since Great Britain was in--
at this point in time--

179
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,790
perpetual war with France, this

180
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,076
becomes the Fifth Coalition.

181
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:38,070
   

182
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,920
But this one is fairly
short-lived.

183
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,980
Napoleon says gee, I got these
guys on my eastern front.

184
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Austria is re-declaring
war on me.

185
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,330
So he leaves Spain to
go lead that fight.

186
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,210
And he leaves 300,000 of
his best troops in

187
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,860
Spain to hold Spain.

188
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,690
And frankly, this is the most
important side effect of the

189
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,750
Fifth Coalition, is that it
makes Napoleon go to fight

190
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,150
Austria, to lead that effort,
as opposed to

191
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,680
worrying about Spain.

192
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,790
And essentially by doing that--
and I don't know if

193
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,300
it's necessarily the fact that
Napoleon wasn't there.

194
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,250
But it could be because Napoleon
wasn't there-- is

195
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,510
that Spain just becomes
a major thorn

196
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,390
in Napoleon's side.

197
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,480
This guerrilla warfare just
continues on and on and on.

198
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,990
And it just goes
back and forth.

199
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,550
And the French will
win a battle and

200
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,360
they'll win another battle.

201
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,470
But they still don't
have control.

202
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,240
And these guerrillas will kind
of peck at them and continue

203
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,680
the uprising.

204
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,190
And this really just drains
the French army.

205
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,060
And really just gets at them
little bit by little bit,

206
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,340
really over the remainder
of Napoleon's reign.

207
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,540
So all the way until 1814.

208
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,800
We haven't gone over that yet.

209
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,870
But this occurs all
the way to 1814.

210
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,140
So I said at the beginning the
video, this is one of the

211
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,950
starting points of Napoleon's
downfall.

212
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,490
That's just because he was just
stuck in Spain from 1808

213
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,260
on, just continuing to have to
send troops and supplies and

214
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,730
reinforcements and wealth to
support what they called the

215
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,980
Peninsular Campaign.

216
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,300
   

217
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,420
And it just drains him.

218
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,710
It drains his resources,
it drains his energy.

219
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,200
And it really hurts his ability
to fight wars with all

220
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,800
of the other people who he
needs to fight wars with.

221
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,660
This is one of the
major downfalls.

222
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,720
The other one, which we'll
probably talk about in the

223
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,830
next video or video
after that, is

224
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,060
his invasion of Russia.

225
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,140
Which he does in 1812.

226
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,340
One could debate which
one drains

227
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,280
France's resources more.

228
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,950
But the invasion of
Russia really

229
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,040
decimates Napoleon's forces.

230
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,950
And really makes him susceptible
to really conquest

231
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,160
by England and all of
the other allies.

232
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,590
And we're going to see that
in a couple of videos.

233
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,810
So you have this been Peninsular
Campaign continuing

234
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,920
to drain Napoleon.

235
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,880
It all started because he
wanted to enforce the

236
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,570
Continental System
on Portugal.

237
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,580
And he got a little
bit greedy.

238
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,480
And he also wanted
to conquer Spain.

239
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
And just to highlight
why it's called

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,490
the Peninsular Campaign.

241
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,050
This right here, a little bit
of geography, this is called

242
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,120
the Iberian Peninsula right
there that I'm circling.

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,580
So you could call it the Iberian
Peninsular Campaign,

244
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,895
because it's everything that's
going on in this Peninsula in

245
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,145
Spain and Portugal.

246
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:33,220
   

247
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,290
Now if we back up a little bit
back to 1808, where we had

248
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,380
this uprising in Spain, and
they were able to push the

249
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,380
French back.

250
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:45,320
At the same time, you also had a
popular uprising in Portugal

251
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,330
roughly in the fall, late
summer or fall of 1808.

252
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,440
The British got excited.

253
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,570
They saw it as their chance to
push Napoleon out of Portugal.

254
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,880
So you have this
gentleman right

255
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,830
here, Sir Arthur Wellesley.

256
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,600
He's a future Duke
of Wellington.

257
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,590
And he's eventually going to
be responsible for pushing

258
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,720
Napoleon out of Spain
entirely.

259
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,970
Or at least out of Madrid.

260
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:19,270
   

261
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,670
Him and along with the British
and along with the Portuguese

262
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,240
are able to push the French
out in August of 1808.

263
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,510
So let me put this in my not so
neatly drawn timeline here.

264
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,280
So in December, Napoleon is
back, so right before that in

265
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,836
August, out of Portugal.

266
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:39,970
   

267
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,900
And this is another motivation
for Napoleon to say,

268
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,570
gee, you know what?

269
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,340
Things aren't going well on the
Iberian Peninsula, I have

270
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,810
to take charge of
things myself.

271
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,000
Now, at the very same time as
all of this is happening, and

272
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,200
this is really just kind of
out of interest. Well it's

273
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,510
more than out of interest,
because actually it has huge

274
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,460
global repercussions.

275
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,680
You might say, OK, well you have
this Iberian Peninsula.

276
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,510
Spain is going back and
forth between the

277
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,690
French and the guerillas.

278
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,590
And Portugal has this whole
situation where their king was

279
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,180
dethrowned, but then the British
help and take it back.

280
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,720
But you could imagine, these
nations are in just a super

281
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,970
state of flux.

282
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,950
   

283
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,440
Now you could also imagine, the
King of Spain wasn't just

284
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,640
the King of Spain, he was King
of the Spanish Empire.

285
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,670
And the Spanish Empire, the main
land mass of the Spanish

286
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,180
Empire was in the Americas.

287
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,170
So this right here.

288
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,830
That was the Spanish
Empire at the time.

289
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,900
This was a 400 year old
Spanish Empire.

290
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,970
Starting with Columbus sailing
the ocean blue in 1492.

291
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,490
You had this huge
Spanish Empire.

292
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,680
And one of the really important
side effects of

293
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,180
Napoleon invading Spain and
having this long protracted

294
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,380
engagement in Spain, is it
catalyzed the ability of these

295
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,040
colonies at the time to start
looking for their

296
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,500
independence.

297
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,260
And we're going to do whole
videos on that in the future.

298
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,890
But this really is one of the
things that allowed them to

299
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,350
get independence.

300
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,860
Obviously, if the empire is in
flux, these guys can say hey,

301
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,860
gee, why do we have to listen
to that nation anymore?

302
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,950
We don't even know who's
in charge there.

303
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,580
At the same time, same
thing in Portugal.

304
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,540
Brazilian independence didn't
come until a little bit later

305
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,860
after this period, but
Napoleon's invasion is what

306
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,320
really sparked the beginning
of a lot

307
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,500
of turmoil in Portugal.

308
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,300
And that eventually is one of
the causes that leads to the

309
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,510
eventual independence
of Brazil.

310
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,790
That doesn't happen for another
10 or 15 years.

311
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,240
But you could imagine, this is
where a lot of that action can

312
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,550
be traced back.

313
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,510
Now, another interesting
point that

314
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,900
occurred around this time.

315
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,580
And actually, I didn't tell
you what happened

316
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,710
on the Fifth Coalition.

317
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,500
I said Austria declared war.

318
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,730
Obviously Britain was
already at war.

319
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,130
So it was the Fifth Coalition.

320
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,200
Napoleon had to leave, that
maybe made Spain a little bit

321
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,860
harder to hold for France.

322
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,550
And that's why it kind of
bled France slowly.

323
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,580
But Napoleon was able to
take care of Austria.

324
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,930
And then he was able to
take a little bit

325
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,140
more land from them.

326
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,890
Actually Galicia, this area of
Austria was given to the Duchy

327
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,880
of Warsaw, which was a French
satellite state.

328
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,330
And then Austria once again, had
to say oh Napoleon, we're

329
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,460
your friend, we're going to
do whatever you ask us to.

330
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,020
So you can imagine at this time
landwise, the empire of

331
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,530
Napoleon seemed pretty
dramatic.

332
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,480
You could include Spain here.

333
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,500
Although he had to spend a lot
of resources to keep Spain.

334
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,510
And then now we had Austria, at
least it was in the fold.

335
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,770
You know Prussia was not
really happy about it.

336
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,230
But this whole area here, the
western half of Poland was

337
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,300
under French control.

338
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,310
Germany-- the Confederacy
of the Rhine--

339
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,600
which is now Germany.

340
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,070
And then a good bit of Italy,
the Kingdom of Italy was also

341
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,900
a French satellite state.

342
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,950
But Napoleon, of course, he
wanted everyone to participate

343
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,870
in the Continental System.

344
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,440
That's the only way to really
strangle England.

345
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,940
And the Papal States were
not participating in the

346
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,190
Continental System.

347
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,500
   

348
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,270
So he sent some people over
to kind of try to

349
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,339
convince them to.

350
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,470
And when they didn't, they
occupied the Papal States.

351
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,630
So French troops occupied
the Papal States.

352
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,920
And then once again, this
was still back in 1808.

353
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,620
This is actually early
1808, it's just

354
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,120
on a different front.

355
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,040
So in February, up
here, in 1808.

356
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,460
Actually, that's before they
even occupied Madrid.

357
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:42,070
So in 1808, February, French
troops occupy Papal States.

358
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,720
   

359
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,300
They essentially give them over
to the Kingdom of Italy,

360
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,180
which at that time was a
French satellite state.

361
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,090
So it's almost like annexing
it to France.

362
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,020
And then once the Fifth
Coalition was done with,

363
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,880
Napoleon felt so good about
himself, that he formally

364
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,530
annexed the Papal States.

365
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,900
Now we're in 1809.

366
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:19,030
In 1809, he formally-- The
Papal States are actually

367
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,940
annexed into the
French Empire.

368
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,360
   

369
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,410
Now you can imagine that
the Pope wasn't

370
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,530
that happy about this.

371
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,660
This is the Pope at the time,
this is Pius VII.

372
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,960
   

373
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,590
He wasn't so happy about it.

374
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,660
So he excommunicates Napoleon.

375
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,230
And I'll do a whole video
on excommunication.

376
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,210
But it's really about as bad as
something you could do to

377
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,990
someone within the powers
of the Catholic Church.

378
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,700
And by implication, you're no
longer part of the church, and

379
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,430
you'll probably go to hell now,
at least if the Pope has

380
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,610
anything to do with it.

381
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,560
So Napoleon wasn't
happy about this.

382
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,110
He sent some people, some
officers, once again to talk

383
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,180
to the Pope about it.

384
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,410
To say hey, gee, why
do you want to

385
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,700
excommunicate Napoleon?

386
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,920
Why don't you just play nice?

387
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,470
Why don't you just agree to
whatever Napoleon says?

388
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,060
The Pope doesn't agree, and
so he gets abducted.

389
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,310
This is why it's interesting.

390
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,710
Napoleon, he's not afraid to
take some serious action.

391
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,370
So he gets abducted in 1809
by French officers.

392
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:32,450
   

393
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,120
And it's not clear, it's not
obvious that Napoleon told

394
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,930
them to do it.

395
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,990
But once he was abducted, and
they actually started

396
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,430
shuttling him all around France
depending on who needed

397
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,200
to talk to him.

398
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,800
Or if they were afraid that the
British might try to free

399
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,560
him from one port, they would
send them some place else.

400
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,810
But it wasn't clear that
Napoleon ordered this.

401
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,020
But he never ordered
his release.

402
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,180
So in some ways, you got
to say that it was

403
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,240
sanctioned by Napoleon.

404
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,790
So all of this mess starts, you
know, Napoleon is messing

405
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,520
with the Pope.

406
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,730
He has this ongoing bleeding
going on in Spain.

407
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,620
And that ends actually in 1812
where Sir Arthur Wellesley

408
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,240
finally retakes Madrid.

409
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,590
But during this whole period,
you can imagine it's really

410
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:20,830
draining into the resources
of the French Empire.

411
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,400
