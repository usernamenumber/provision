1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,470
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's do some more
derivative problems.

4
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:11,910
Let's say I want to figure out
the derivative d over dx of--

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,856
and let me give something that
looks a little bit different--

6
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:27,070
x to the third minus 5x to the
fifth, all of that to the third

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:41,820
power over 2x plus 5
to the fifth power.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,850
This is a parentheses.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,610
This is just saying that I want
to take the derivative of

10
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,840
this entire expression.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,080
So you're saying Sal, we've
never learn how to do this,

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,090
you have something in the
numerator, you have something

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,710
in the denominator I don't
know what to do next.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,050
Well let's just rewrite this.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,310
Actually in your calculus
textbooks there's something

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,350
called the quotient rule, which
I think is mildly lame, because

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,290
the quotient rule is just the
product rule where you have a

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,860
negative exponent and they make
it another rule, and they

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:06,720
clutter your brain.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,470
So instead of using the
quotient rule, we're just

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,780
going to rewrite this bottom
expression as a product,

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,130
and then we can use
the product rule.

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,500
So this is the same thing as
taking the derivative of x to

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,830
the third minus 5x to the
fifth, all of that to the third

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,120
power, times 2x plus 5 to what?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,380
The minus fifth power.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,060
And now we can use
the product rule.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,140
Take the derivative of the
first term-- and the derivative

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,220
of the first term isn't a
joke-- you take the derivative

30
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,190
of the inside first, let's do
the chain rule, derivative

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,760
of the inside first.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:52,010
That is 3x squared minus 25x to
the fourth times the derivative

33
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,700
of the outside, 3 times this
entire expression x to the

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,580
third minus 5x to the fifth.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,610
And then all of that, take this
exponent down one to the

36
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,510
squared, and then multiply
it times this whole term.

37
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:14,630
So 2x plus 5 to
the minus fifth.

38
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,240
And then to that we
add the derivative of

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,570
this term, so plus.

40
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,400
So the derivative of this term
we take the derivative of the

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
inside, which is pretty easy.

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,060
It's just 2 times the
derivative of the outside,

43
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,065
which is minus 5.

44
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:33,620
And just so you know I didn't
skip a step, the derivative of

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,610
2x plus 5, the derivative of 2x
is 2, derivative of 5 is 0.

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,270
So the derivative of
2x plus 5 is just 2.

47
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,990
So it's 2 times
minus 5 2x plus 5.

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,410
We just keep that the same to
the minus fifth power, and then

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,360
we multiply it times this first
expression, x to the third

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,340
minus 5x to the fifth
to the third power.

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,270
I know that's really messy and
you'll probably not see

52
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,570
problems this messy, but I just
wanted to show you that the

53
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,630
product rule we learned-- it's
actually the product and the

54
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,430
chain rule-- they can apply to
a lot of different problems,

55
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,696
and even though you hadn't seen
something like this where you

56
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:08,880
had numerator and a
denominator, you can easily

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,150
rewrite what you had in
the denominator as a

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,190
negative exponent.

59
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,080
And then of course it's just
the product for when you don't

60
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,090
have to memorize that silly
thing called the quotient rule.

61
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,460
So with that out of the way,
I'm now going to introduce you

62
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,450
to some common derivatives
of other functions.

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,840
And these things are actually
normally included in the inside

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,340
cover of your calculus book,
and they're just good to

65
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,820
know, good things to know.

66
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,030
And maybe in a later
presentation I'll actually

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,000
prove these things.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,710
You should never take
things at face value.

69
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,290
So you should to some degree
memorize these, although you

70
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,640
should prove it to
yourself first.

71
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,140
So the derivative of e to the
x-- and I find this to be

72
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,855
amazing. e shows up all sorts
of crazy places in mathematics,

73
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:56,770
and it's you know the strange
number 2.7 whatever, whatever

74
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,560
and it has all sorts of
strange properties.

75
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,660
And I think this is one of the
most bizarre properties of e.

76
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,930
The derivative of e to the x.

77
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,880
So if I want to figure out
the slope of any point along

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,820
the curve e to the x-- this
just might blow your mind.

79
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,610
I think the more you think
about it, the more it'll blow

80
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,010
your mind-- is e to the x.

81
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,950
That's amazing.

82
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,810
At any point along the curve
e to the x, the slope of

83
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,900
that point is e to the x.

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,230
Just to hit the point home.

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,150
I'm diverging, a little bit.

86
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,640
But if I said f of x is
equal to e to the x, right?

87
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,590
And let's say f of 2 is
equal to e squared.

88
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,540
And I asked you, friend-- I
don't know your name-- what

89
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:52,010
is the slope of e to the x
at the point 2,e squared.

90
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,540
And you could say Sal,
the slope at that

91
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,510
point is e squared.

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,720
That blows my mind that it's a
function where the slope at

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,960
any point on that line is
equal to the function.

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,570
And it's e. e shows up
all sorts of places.

95
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,070
I might do a whole series of
presentations called the

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,530
magic of e, because e shows
up all over the place.

97
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,360
Well I don't want to diverge
too much, so that's

98
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,530
pretty amazing.

99
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,760
Next I'm going to show you what
I think is probably the second

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,980
most amazing derivative-- and I
don't think this has been fully

101
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,740
explored in mathematics yet,
because this also blows my

102
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:34,870
mind-- is that the derivative
of the natural log of x, right.

103
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,980
So the natural log is just the
logarithm with base e, and I

104
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,440
hope you remember
your logarithms.

105
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,220
So what's the derivative
of the natural log of x?

106
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,480
So once again this
is e related.

107
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,430
Well it's 1/x.

108
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,730
That also blows my mind.

109
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,800
Because think about it.

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,270
Let's draw a bunch
of functions.

111
00:05:52,270 --> 00:06:00,940
If I said the derivative
of x to the minus 3 is

112
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,460
minus 3x to the minus 4.

113
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,690
The derivative of x to
the minus 2 is minus

114
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,480
2x to the minus 3.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,850
The derivative of x to
the minus 1 is minus

116
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,870
1 x to the minus 2.

117
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:30,750
The derivative of x to the 0--
well this is just 1, right?

118
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,920
The derivative of x to the 0 is
just 1, so the derivative is 0.

119
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,382
The derivative of x is 1,
derivative of x squared

120
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:42,470
is 2x and so on, right?

121
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,420
So it's interesting.

122
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,130
We have this pattern from all
the derivatives of all of the

123
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,940
of kind of the exponents in
increasing order where you go

124
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,360
from x to the minus 4 x to the
minus 3, x to the minus 2 and

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,100
then there's no x to
the minus 1 here.

126
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,920
We go straight to x to the 0.

127
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,040
What happened to x the minus 1?

128
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,590
What happened to this?

129
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,290
What function's derivative
is x to the minus 1?

130
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,860
This is bizarre to me.

131
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,490
Where did it go?

132
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,260
And it turns out that
it's a natural log.

133
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,260
This I still think about before
I go to bed sometimes because

134
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,830
it is kind of mind blowing.

135
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,370
And later in another
presentation I might

136
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,240
actually prove this to you.

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,370
But just to know that this is
true, that the derivative of

138
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,810
the natural log of x is 1/x
I think is mind blowing.

139
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,870
And so for now you can
just memorize it.

140
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,150
But both of these
are mind blowing.

141
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,830
The derivative of e to the x is
e to the x, and the derivative

142
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,780
of the natural log of x is 1/x.

143
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,700
And I'll just do a couple of
more just to present them to

144
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,950
you, and then in the next
presentation we'll actually use

145
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,680
them using the product rule and
the chain rule and et

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,170
cetera, et cetera.

147
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,120
And you might want to rewatch
this and memorize them.

148
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,760
I want to clear image.

149
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,910
OK.

150
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,920
And now I'll just do the basic
trig functions, and you should

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
memorize these as well.

152
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,510
The derivative of sin of x--
this is pretty easy to

153
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,140
remember-- is cosine of x.

154
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,850
So the slope at any point
along the [? line ?]

155
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,260
sin of x is actually the
cosine of that point.

156
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,050
That's also interesting.

157
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,460
One day I'm going to do this
holographically because I

158
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,060
think that might not be
sinking in properly.

159
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,610
The derivative of cosine
of x is minus sin of x.

160
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,710
There are good to memorize
though, because you'll be

161
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,500
able to recall is quickly
on a test and then use it.

162
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,620
And then finally the derivative
of tan of x is equal to 1 over

163
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,900
cosine square of x which you
could also write as the

164
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,580
secant squared of x.

165
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,170
You might want to memorize
these now, and actually I

166
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,790
encourage you to explore these
things, I encourage you to

167
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,980
graph each of these functions.

168
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,160
Graph a function, graph its
derivative and look at them,

169
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,080
and really intuitively
understand why the derivative

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,040
function actually does
describe the slope of

171
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,820
the original function.

172
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,610
And actually I'll probably
do a presentation on that.

173
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,065
But I'm almost out of time
in this presentation,

174
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:03,950
so just memorize these.

175
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,380
And memorize the derivative of
e to the x, e to the x, and

176
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,940
the natural log of x is 1/x.

177
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,720
And in the next presentation
we're going to start mixing and

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,910
matching all of these
functions, and we can use the

179
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,490
product and chain rule on them
to solve kind of arbitrarily

180
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,520
complex derivatives.

181
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,320
Between what we've just seen,
we could probably solve 95% of

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,100
the derivative problems
you'll see on say the

183
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,140
calculus AP test.

184
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,810
I'll see you in the
next presentation.

185
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,400
