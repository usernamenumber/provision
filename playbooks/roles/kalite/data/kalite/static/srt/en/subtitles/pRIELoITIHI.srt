1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:05,253
Everyone's talking about "inflation" and "deflation" these days, including myself.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:06,945
And that's because it's important.

3
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:10,645
And in order to really have an informed view on it,

4
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:14,001
I think it's important to actually look at how "inflation" is defined.

5
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,895
(And right here, I actually took a screenshot (from my Bloomberg terminal)

6
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:22,297
of the basket of goods that makes up the Consumer Price Index --

7
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:27,591
the index that sets everything from the coupons on Treasury-inflation-protected securities --

8
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,435
This is the index that dictates what Social
Security payments are going [to be],

9
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:34,020
how fast they're going to grow -- I'm sure a bunch of union agreements and

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,767
pension agreements are dependent on the CPI.

11
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:38,472
So this is the underlying basket of goods

12
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:41,080
that really tells us what inflation is.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,422
At a first level, it's just fun to look at.

14
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:47,567
Because you can compare your own household

15
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,720
to what the government thinks is a typical household.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,400
For example, the government says that the typical

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,870
household spends 15.7% of their disposable income on --

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,686
-- and that's essentially the income that you take home after paying taxes --

19
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,599
that they spend 15.7% on food and beverages.

20
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,560
That seems reasonable.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,910
What's even more interesting is that they break it down.

22
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,020
They get very granular.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,220
They try to figure out how much do you spend on eggs,

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,160
and fish, and poultry, and bakery products.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,810
And that's good because, let's say, everything else stays constant,

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,180
but the price of eggs goes through the roof,

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,790
because, [for example,] the Atkins diet becomes popular again.

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,870
Then you can actually make an informed decision

29
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,925
as to why inflation is going up or whether inflation will go up going forward.

30
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,540
So that's just interesting to look at.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,740
If you look at the major categories:

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,540
they have food and beverages, housing --

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,958
And I'm going to come back to housing.

34
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:45,000
Because this is, in general, just a very interesting area to focus on

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
because it makes such a big portion of the CPI.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,810
And it's been such a big
portion of the economic picture

37
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,600
especially
the last 10 years.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,042
And obviously, it's become a big problem, has become a big factor

39
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:59,928
in terms of what's causing the financial crisis right now.

40
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,630
But housing is about 43% of disposable income.

41
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,540
Apparel: 3%.

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,910
Transportation: 15%.

43
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:12,607
This includes things like new vehicles, 4%, used cars and trucks.

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,740
And I think the way they calculate this is, they say,

45
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,602
what percentage of Americans are driving new vehicles versus used vehicles?

46
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:23,215
And they put fuel in here.

47
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,610
A lot of people, when I have this inflation-deflation argument,

48
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,502
they make this argument that China and India are going to continue growing.

49
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:35,886
And because of that, commodities like oil and fuel will continue to increase.

50
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,390
Although people were making that argument more last summer

51
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,390
but even now people are making that argument.

52
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,640
But in a developed country, you see that motor fuel

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,408
even though it hits your pocketbook on the margin

54
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:50,240
it isn't that big a part of your total expenditure.

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,970
Especially when you compare it to things like housing.

56
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,440
And if you keep going down, medical care: 6%.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,220
And then recreation.

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,860
They break it down and you could look this up.

59
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,230
I think the Bureau of Labor
Statistics has this broken down as well

60
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,890
although it was much easier to get it on the Bloomberg terminal.

61
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,250
Education: on average, 3%.

62
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,928
Obviously, if you're sending your kids to college that's a much higher number.

63
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:14,785
But, on average, if you take the average household.

64
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:18,663
And finally, other goods
and services: tobacco, et cetera, et cetera.

65
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:21,050
So that one is just interesting
to look at.

66
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,529
So whenever you have a
discussion on the things that may or may not drive inflation

67
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:30,465
it's important to weight them by these weightings
that the CPI gives them

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,631
to actually figure out what the actual
impact on how we measure inflation really will be.

69
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:45,637
With that said, if you think
about it, really the biggest portion of this is the
housing piece.

70
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,490
I think that's fair. Housing is a large percentage
of most people's disposable income

71
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,247
especially in
a Western society

72
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,005
You can imagine, if you live in
a Third-World country, and you're barely getting by.

73
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:58,346
Food
might be a huge part of your expenditure

74
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:03,320
maybe rivaling
housing if you've just kind of built a house someplace.

75
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,079
But in a developed society,
housing is a huge percentage of it.

76
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,614
And I want to focus on one
thing, and a lot of people have talked about this.

77
00:04:11,614 --> 00:04:15,130
And actually Mish -- once again,
from Global Economic Analysis --

78
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,790
he really encouraged me
to highlight this.

79
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,006
So within housing, obviously
some people rent, some people buy.

80
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:25,074
And so, they give a 6% weighting
of the whole basket to rent

81
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:28,770
and then they give a
roughly 24%, 25% weighting to something that they call

82
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,897
owners' equivalent of rent of primary residence.

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:37,810
So this is essentially their
attempt to measure

84
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,640
how much it costs to live for people
who own houses.

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,940
What's interesting, and you
probably have caught onto it,

86
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,980
is they use the words "owners'
equivalent rent."

87
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,160
So what they do -- and this is the
current methodology --

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,390
They don't say, "How much
is your mortgage?"

89
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,390
They don't say, how much does
it cost you to buy the house

90
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,280
and amortize it over the
reasonable life of the house?

91
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,890
They actually just say, how
much would it cost to rent that house?

92
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,990
And they've kept waffling back
and forth between-- sometimes

93
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,720
they just look for equivalent
houses, and they say, well,

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,980
how much would that
cost to rent?

95
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,900
At one point they were actually
surveying people

96
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,022
and they would ask them, how
much would it cost to rent your house?

97
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:19,120
Which is probably even
a worse number.

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,358
But the bottom line is, they're
not factoring in actual mortgages.

99
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:26,300
And you can even see it
on the weighting.

100
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,220
Right when I looked at these
numbers, I was like, well,

101
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,080
roughly 66% of people
own houses.

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,838
How come this number isn't
66% relative to this number, right? It's closer to 80%.

103
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,512
I was like, oh, I know that's
fair because more people actually live in homes.

104
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:49,160
You could say that 66% of
overall households own

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,593
but in general, homes are bigger,
there might be more people in it.

106
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:57,688
So you could either think of it
on a person basis or maybe on a square footage basis.

107
00:05:57,688 --> 00:06:01,880
It makes a little bit more sense
to weight houses higher.

108
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,870
But what's interesting here,
is that this number,

109
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:12,759
especially if you add these
two, housing in general is about 30% of disposable
income.

110
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,730
And traditionally that was the
rule that a bank would use

111
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,356
to decide whether you can
afford a house.

112
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:23,910
It shouldn't be more than a
third of your disposal income,

113
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,978
or at least a mortgage
payment shouldn't be more than a third

114
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,970
We know, especially over this
last real estate bubble,

115
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,835
that's become a much, much
larger percentage of people's actual disposal income.

116
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:39,906
So you wonder, why is this
weighting only 30% of disposable income?

117
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,430
Well, that's because they use
owners' equivalent rent.

118
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,279
They didn't actually
say what people's mortgage payments are.

119
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,965
So even though mortgage payments
might be going through the roof

120
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,276
even though
the price of a house might be going through the roof

121
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:57,180
it does
not get reflected in the CPI number as of
the early `80s.

122
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,288
This is straight from
the Bureau Of Labor Statistics website.

123
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,610
And they wrote-- and they're
actually using doublespeak here

124
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,930
I just copied and pasted
it straight from their website

125
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,830
--"until the early 1980s, the
CPI used what is called

126
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,463
the asset price method to measure
the change in the cost of owner-occupied housing."

127
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,840
That makes sense and I'm not
sure whether they just looked

128
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,380
at how much houses cost this
year relative to last year

129
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,860
and then they put that into the
weighting

130
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,960
or they determined the weighting based on people's
average mortgage.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,330
But in general, that's a good
way to measure it, right?

132
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,480
Either your mortgage payment, or
how much houses cost.

133
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,845
They said, "the asset price method
treats the purchase of an asset

134
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:38,923
such as a house, as it
does the purchase of any consumer good." Fair enough.

135
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,220
"Because the asset price
method can lead to inappropriate results--" And
this is the key line.

136
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:49,894
"Because the asset price method can lead
to inappropriate results for goods

137
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:55,036
that are purchased
largely for investment reasons." I agree with that.

138
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:57,930
If something is purchased
largely for investment reasons

139
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:04,217
if I'm purchasing gold,
maybe that shouldn't be included in the CPI

140
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,095
because
it's largely for investment reasons or for stocks.

141
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:10,060
But then they use this kind of
completely disjointed logic.

142
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,740
They say, you know, "because
asset price method can lead to

143
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,305
inappropriate results for
goods that are purchased largely for investment reasons,

144
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,468
the CPI implemented the rental equivalence approach

145
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:24,122
to measuring price change for owner-occupied
housing."

146
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:26,949
To me, that makes no sense.

147
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:31,515
Owner-occupied is not purchased for investment reasons.

148
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:34,778
That's a fair enough argument
if you're doing it for rentals

149
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,380
or if you're doing
it for vacation homes.

150
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,950
But for actual owner-occupied
housing, this sentence makes no sense.

151
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:47,128
Based on their own rationale,
there's no reason to transfer to this rental equivalent
approach.

152
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:50,788
The whole reason why I'm going
here is,

153
00:08:50,788 --> 00:08:57,368
because in the early `80s, I think 1983-- they say
it right here, in January, 1983--

154
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:59,845
because they switched
over to this,

155
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,350
this kind of inflation that we've seen
in the price of houses,

156
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,585
especially the real estate
bubble we've seen the last 10 years,

157
00:09:05,585 --> 00:09:08,562
in no way got
incorporated into the inflation numbers.

158
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:10,460
So it essentially understated
them.

159
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,840
You can see that here.

160
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,620
Well, two things: not only did
it understate it,

161
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,720
but it probably understated the
weighting itself.

162
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,910
And Mish, he's had a couple
of posts about this.

163
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,260
You really should use
something like the Case-Shiller Index on this line
right here,

164
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,210
instead of doing this for owners'
equivalent.

165
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,580
But I'd argue one
step further.

166
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,910
Not only should you use
something like the Case-Shiller Index

167
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,800
but to
actually gauge this weighting

168
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,100
you should actually survey
people

169
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,460
and say what percentage of your disposable
income is dedicated to

170
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,430
your mortgage and other things
related to owning a house?

171
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:49,142
And especially over the last
seven years, I would guess, and I'm almost sure about this,

172
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,350
that it would be much larger than 30% of your
disposal income.

173
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,370
So not only was this number
being understated

174
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,230
or the growth in that number, because
it didn't incorporate the increase in housing prices,

175
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,874
but
this weighting itself was understated.

176
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:05,429
And just to get a sense of
how much, this is the Case-Shiller Index.

177
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,650
And you could look up the
Case-Shiller Index

178
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,138
but, in my opinion, it's the best index
for actual increases or decreases in the
price of homes.

179
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:20,772
You see from 2001 to 2006
roughly, houses were increasing by 10%
to 15% a year.

180
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:23,630
So if you use that instead of
the rental equivalent

181
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,360
then over the same timeframe-- I
don't have a chart for rent,

182
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,770
but rent was not increasing at
anywhere near this pace.

183
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,260
If anything, people were leaving
apartments to buy houses

184
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,930
so rent was actually
staying pretty stable.

185
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,608
But 10% to 15%-- this is year
over year growth, this is what this chart is.

186
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:46,790
So 10% to 15%, if you weight
that at 30% of the CPI basket,

187
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:52,739
then really the reported
inflation number was being understated by 3%
to 5% a year.

188
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,898
And I'd argue that this
weighting should have grown over that time period

189
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:58,469
because
people were spending more and more

190
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:04,499
of their disposable
income on their mortgage payments.

191
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:05,760
Then this weighting should've
been more like 40%

192
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,600
and you could have said you're
understating it by 4% to 6%.

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,158
And if you look here,
this is the actual reported CPI numbers.

194
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,178
What I'm saying is, over that
timeframe, the real inflation number should have
been up here.

195
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,559
And then, now that we have
actual deflation in home prices, this is zero.

196
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,901
So now, the most recent
Case-Shiller numbers say that housing has depreciated
by 20%.

197
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:32,650
We're essentially understating
the deflation now.

198
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,420
So although right now the CPI
has us at kind of the zero mark

199
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,080
if you actually
incorporated the real prices of homes

200
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,705
and you didn't use
rents as a proxy for it

201
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,770
you would actually get a much more
negative number here.

202
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,870
And Mish actually did
that on his blog.

203
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,624
And if you actually want to read
his blog, which I highly recommend,

204
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:55,800
do a Google search
for Mish, M-I-S-H. And this is directly from his
blog

205
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,679
so I have to give him credit for that. And what he did here is

206
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,655
he actually charted the actual inflation numbers that 
were reported. That's in blue.

207
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:09,773
And then on top of that, he
put what he calls the Case-Shiller CPI Index

208
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:15,399
and that's in red. And you see here, especially
over the housing boom--

209
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,340
These are the inflation numbers we
got from the government.

210
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:24,692
They peaked out in the 4% or 5%
range, which isn't low by any stretch of the imagination,

211
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:29,162
and that's probably why the Feds started
increasing interest rates right around here

212
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,690
arguably at
the worst possible time.

213
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,940
But if you look at the CS CPI,
or the Case-Shiller CPI

214
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,925
you could almost say that the real
inflation actually peaked out in the 8% range back here.

215
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,240
And you could argue that, if
this was the actual number that the Fed was using

216
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,140
it would
have actually been a much better policy tool

217
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,488
because
they would have seen the inflation pop up back
here in January '03.

218
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:55,450
And they would have known that
they were keeping their monetary policy too loose back
here

219
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,131
and they could've avoided this whipsawing that they did
and in 2007 and 2008.

220
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:06,605
And I'd argue even further
that even this number is understanding the reality

221
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:10,880
because back here, as a percentage of the actual CPI
basket,

222
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,839
he just took the CPI numbers and replaced the year
over year change essentially

223
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,010
into the same weighting as
the current CPI numbers.

224
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,440
But if you actually weighted it
based on the actual amount of disposable income

225
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,890
people
were spending on their mortgages

226
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,588
I would guess that it
would have looked something more like this.

227
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:35,407
And you would have seen actual
inflation peak out here, probably in the 10%
or 11% range.

228
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,688
There's a lot of social
commentary about this; why they do it.

229
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,861
One argument is

230
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:49,495
that a lot of
the government's or even corporate liabilities are
indexed to inflation.

231
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,060
You have an inflation index.

232
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,623
On the other hand, the sale of
homes

233
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:59,602
essentially transfers wealth from one generation
to another.

234
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:06,988
Especially when you have
a huge increase in the price of homes.

235
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:09,798
If they did this on purpose,
and I'm guessing that they did

236
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:13,200
it allows housing prices
to increase dramatically.

237
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,430
And when housing prices increase
dramatically

238
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,669
it transfers wealth from the new
buyer generation to the retiree generation

239
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,950
so it helps
subsidize the retirees.

240
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,370
And, at the same time, by taking
it out of the actual CPI index

241
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,618
it keeps the
government's, and actually a lot of other corporate,
liabilities low.

242
00:14:32,618 --> 00:14:37,535
Because now Social
Security, it's indexed to the CPI numbers.

243
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,740
So if the CPI numbers are not
incorporating, are not raising up here

244
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,248
you don't have to
increase people's Social Security payments.

245
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,280
And you kind of get to project
this farce to people.

246
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,993
You say, oh, in inflation
adjusted terms, you're doing better than your parents'
generation did.

247
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,290
Oh, but, by the way, you can
afford 1/3 the house now.

248
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,668
And to some degree that's been
propagated-- it's obviously all falling apart now.

249
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:05,551
But the big takeaway from this,
if I had to give you just one,

250
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:09,740
is that the
CPI index is a government created tool.

251
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,550
It's based on a survey and, not
only has it not been the same survey,

252
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,890
but it's actively
changed over the years.

253
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,435
And it's changed in ways that
significantly impact the actual numbers that are reported

254
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:27,166
and, to some degree, play into what I think
the government wants people to believe.

255
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,270
Anyway see you in
the next video.
