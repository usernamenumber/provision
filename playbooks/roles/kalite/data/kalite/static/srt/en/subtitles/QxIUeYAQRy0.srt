1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,810
In this video, not only are we
going to pay attention to how

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,800
these two molecules will react,
but we'll also pay

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,500
attention to the

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,560
stereochemistry of the end product.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,040
To do that, we have to
pay attention to the

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,460
stereochemistry of the things
that we're beginning with.

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,110
And this is just regular
hydroxide anion, we've seen

9
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,200
this show before.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,200
This is going to act
as the nucleophile.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,940
It's not the strongest
nucleophile.

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,750
it's not iodide, but it's a
pretty good nucleophile.

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,560
So we have a good nucleophile
here.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,700
   

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,210
And then over here,
we have a carbon.

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,790
It's not a methyl carbon.

17
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,130
It's not bonded to a
bunch of hydrogens.

18
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,790
That would be a super
fast Sn2 reaction.

19
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,970
This guy could attack it.

20
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,900
And it's not even a primary,
it's a secondary.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,860
But we said if we have a pretty
good nucleophile, this

22
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,310
guy's going to want to give his
electrons enough to that,

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,230
that this will happen.

24
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,150
It won't be the fastest
reaction, but we can get an

25
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,230
Sn2 reaction, especially if the
solvent is the right type

26
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:00,800
of solvent.

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,650
And we'll talk more about this
in future videos on what type

28
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,200
of solvents are good for Sn2
reactions versus Sn1.

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,410
So we're going to have
an Sn1 reaction.

30
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,570
We're going to have this
situation where one of the

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,210
electrons from the nucleophile
will be given to this

32
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,180
secondary carbon.

33
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,820
It's bonded to two
other carbons.

34
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,770
So it'll be given to the
secondary carbon, and then

35
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,840
that will allow this bromine
to swipe the carbon that it

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,370
was a bonded with.

37
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,410
And we know bromine is pretty
electronegative, so it's going

38
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:32,760
to do that.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,960
It's going to swipe
that electron.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,370
And then at the end, you're
going to end up with a

41
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,130
bromine, or I should say bromide
now that it's an

42
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,890
anion, a bromide anion.

43
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,300
It swiped that electron.

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,520
Before bromine had one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,510
valence electrons, and now it's
going to swipe this one

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,080
over here, so now it'll have
eight: one, two, three, four,

47
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,160
five, six, seven, eight.

48
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,280
Put a negative charge, it
just gained an electron.

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,960
And then the other stuff
will look like this.

50
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,050
Let me draw that carbon in the
center, that's just like this.

51
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,310
And notice, bromine is leaving
from the right, and the

52
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,120
hydroxide is attacking, or it's
giving its electron from

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,550
the left, or it's bonding
from the left.

54
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,080
So what's it going to look?

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,380
Well, We have this ethyl group
coming straight out

56
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:36,140
forward, CH2, CH3.

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,690
We have the hydrogen that
is still going to

58
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,210
be behind the carbon.

59
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,590
   

60
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,010
So I could draw it like this.

61
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,460
The bromine is no
longer there.

62
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,910
You still have this
methyl group above

63
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,060
it, so that is CH3.

64
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,930
And now this hydroxide has
attacked right in the same

65
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,300
direction that the bromine is
leaving in, but from the

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,950
opposite side.

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,640
So that's leaving to the right,
this guy's entering

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,840
from the left, so then
the hydroxide will be

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,990
bonded like this: O-H.

70
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:19,510
Now we have just described
a classic Sn2 reaction.

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,650
And I always like to emphasize
the Sn2, because my brain

72
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,350
always confuses it with Sn1,
so I like to remind myself,

73
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,680
this is Sn2 because it is
substitution with a

74
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
nucleophile.

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,790
That's the hydroxide
in this case.

76
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,740
And that number two says the
rate-determining step, and

77
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,080
there is only one step in this
reaction, involves both of the

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,990
reactants, and this definitely
is involving both of the

79
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,020
reactants, so this
is a classic Sn2.

80
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,960
The point of this video is to
see what happened to the

81
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,930
stereochemistry of
this molecule.

82
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,205
Obviously, it's a different
molecule on this side, but it

83
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:57,780
had switched from left to right,
or I guess we should

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,510
say that it switched from R to
S, or S to R, or did it stay

85
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,300
in the same direction?

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,210
So let's name this one using our
naming mechanisms. I guess

87
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,240
you could call it the
R-S naming scheme.

88
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,050
And then we'll name this one,
and then we'll see if we

89
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,770
switched our handedness.

90
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,120
So first of all, let's just
name the base molecule.

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,170
This is good review.

92
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,550
So what's our longest
carbon chain?

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,670
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

94
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,240
And actually, I probably
shouldn't have named it that

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,160
way, because this bromo group
is closer to that end.

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,460
So I should number it
starting from here.

97
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,450
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

98
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,150
So methyl is one carbon.

99
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,370
Ethyl is two carbons.

100
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,730
Propyl is three carbons, or
prop- is three, so it's but-,

101
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,780
But- is four carbons, so
it's going to but-.

102
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,945
It's all single bond, so it's
going to be a butane.

103
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:52,220
   

104
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,355
And on the number two carbon, we
have a bromo group, so it's

105
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,605
2-bromobutane.

106
00:04:56,605 --> 00:05:01,660
   

107
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,620
And this is a chiral carbon,
so we have to describe it's

108
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,090
handedness.

109
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,420
And we know it's a chiral
carbon, because everything

110
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,620
it's bonded to is different.

111
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,000
It's bonded to two carbons,
but this is

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,260
a whole ethyl group.

113
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,100
There's two carbons here.

114
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,600
There's only one over there,
and obviously, it's a

115
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,700
hydrogen, and that's
a bromine.

116
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,280
So what's it's handedness?

117
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,130
And to do that, you want to
put the group that has the

118
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,630
lowest atomic number
in the back.

119
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,260
And we know hydrogen has the
lowest atomic number, so it's

120
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,290
already in the back.

121
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,110
So that's convenient.

122
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,250
We don't have to do any
visualization of how you

123
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,130
rotate it, so you put
it in the back.

124
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,480
So that's already in the back.

125
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,900
   

126
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,570
So what we have in the
front is this guy,

127
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,130
this guy, this guy.

128
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,550
And what you do is you start
with the guy with the highest

129
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,260
atomic number, and that would
be bromine right there.

130
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,630
And then you go in a circle in
the direction of the next

131
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,930
highest atomic number.

132
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,790
Carbon and carbon is a tie.

133
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,305
The tie breaker is that
this carbon is

134
00:05:57,305 --> 00:05:58,390
bonded to another carbon.

135
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,530
Well, this carbon is only
bonded to hydrogens.

136
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,330
So you're going to go in this
direction right here.

137
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,150
You're going to go clockwise.

138
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,790
Let me do that in
another color.

139
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,190
You are going to go clockwise.

140
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,280
   

141
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,060
And the way I like to think
about is, on top, we're going

142
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,500
to the right.

143
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,480
We're going clockwise,
so this is R.

144
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,460
S is to the left for sinister,
R for the right.

145
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,250
That's the way I think of it.

146
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,505
So this is R-2-bromobutane.

147
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:30,100
   

148
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,070
So it's handedness is R.

149
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,690
Now, what's this thing
over here?

150
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,430
   

151
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, first of all, once again
we have four carbons.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,330
We have one, two, three,
four carbons, so

153
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,100
but- will be our prefix.

154
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,210
But since the group that we
are attached to is an OH

155
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,240
group, it's a hydroxide group,
this is actually an alcohol.

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,810
So this a little bit of practice
of naming alcohols.

157
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,955
So we still have but-
as our prefix.

158
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:03,160
   

159
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,840
But we wouldn't call
it butane.

160
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,050
Since it has an OH there,
we'll call it butanol.

161
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,470
   

162
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:17,150
And maybe I'll write that in
blue to show the -anol comes

163
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,970
from the OH.

164
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,450
Butanol, or maybe we could say
the -ol comes from-- maybe

165
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,170
that's even better.

166
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,420
Let me just write butanol.

167
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,660
   

168
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,640
That's a different color.

169
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,020
But- -an- and then the -ol comes
from the fact that we

170
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,050
have the OH there.

171
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,050
We're dealing with an alcohol.

172
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,250
And it's attached to the number
two carbon, so we'll

173
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,500
call it 2-butanol.

174
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,040
   

175
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,350
So we went from having
2-bromobutane to 2-butanol,

176
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,220
but what is the handedness
of this?

177
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,750
So same exercise, you put
the lowest atomic

178
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,200
number in the back.

179
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,980
That's the hydrogen.

180
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,200
It's already in the back.

181
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
And then you start with the atom
or the group that has the

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,520
highest atomic number of the
things that are bonded to this

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,570
chiral carbon.

184
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,300
It's still chiral.

185
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,990
All of these things
are different.

186
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,980
You start with whatever has
the highest atomic number.

187
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,410
This oxygen has the highest
atomic number.

188
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,865
And you go in the direction of
the next highest. This carbon

189
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:17,560
and that carbon are tied, but
this one is also attached to

190
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,260
other carbons.

191
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,230
Well, this is attached only to
hydrogens, so we go in this

192
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,040
direction, or counterclockwise,
or in the

193
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,120
sinister direction, or the
leftward direction.

194
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,650
So this is S, S for sinister.

195
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,480
S-2-butanol.

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,640
So the whole point of this video
is to show you that when

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:44,270
you have an Sn2 reaction on a
chiral carbon, that it changes

198
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,220
the carbon's stereochemistry.

199
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,550
It changes its handedness.

200
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,830
It went from being right-handed
to left-handed.

201
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,390
   

202
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,750
It changes its chirality.

203
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,000
You can even imagine a situation
where a bromine

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,070
comes and attacks, and
this bromine leaves.

205
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,830
And then you would actually have
the same 2-bromobutane,

206
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,180
but it would actually switch
its handedness.

207
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,290
This is super important, because
this matters if you

208
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,390
care whether or not you
want to flip the

209
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,680
stereochemistry or not.

210
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,440
What we're going to see in the
next video, or maybe the video

211
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,520
after that, is that in Sn1
reactions, not only do you not

212
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,390
flip your stereochemistry, that
you kind of lose-- if all

213
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,670
of your molecules were
one-handedness, your end

214
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,900
product is going to be a mix of
the two handedness when you

215
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,210
do an Sn1 reaction.

216
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,030
But Sn2, you flip
the handedness.

217
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,570
You saw here.

218
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,910
We started with R-2-bromobutane.

219
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,470
The Sn2 reaction happened.

220
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,280
We ended up with S.

221
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,420
It makes complete sense.

222
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,790
You view this as coming from the
back, so you view this as

223
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,090
kind of an umbrella.

224
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,540
This was kind of an
upturned umbrella.

225
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
This was the handle.

226
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,480
And when this comes in, he
becomes the handle, and the

227
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,770
umbrella flips in
that direction.

228
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,050
So that's one way to
think about it.

229
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,500
So visually, it also should make
a little bit of sense.
