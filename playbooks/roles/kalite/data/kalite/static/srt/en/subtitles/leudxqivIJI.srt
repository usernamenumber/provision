1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,440
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,440
When I left off I was rushing
at the end of this problem

4
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,510
because I tend to rush at the
end of problems when I am

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,160
getting close to the YouTube
10 minute limit.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,680
But I just wanted to review the
end of it because I feel

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,520
like I rushed it.

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,660
And then, actually continue with
it and actually solve for

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,970
the angle and then, introduce
a little bit of-- a little

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,280
more trigonometry.

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,240
So just to review what we did,
we said momentum is conserved

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,270
and in two dimensions that means
momentum is conserved in

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,650
each of the dimensions.

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,040
So we figured out what the
initial momentum of the entire

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,920
system was and we said, well,
in the x direction, the

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,070
initial momentum-- and all the
momentum was coming from the

17
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,440
ball A right.

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,110
Because ball B wasn't moving,
so its velocity was 0.

19
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,570
So its momentum was 0.

20
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,300
So ball A in the x direction and
it was only moving in the

21
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,190
x direction.

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,390
So it's momentum in the x
direction was 3 meters per

23
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,610
second times 10 kilogram
meters per second.

24
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,050
And we got 30 kilogram
meters per second.

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,960
And then there was no momentum
in the y direction.

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,680
And then we knew that well after
they hit each other,

27
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,910
ball A kind of ricochets off
at a 30 degree angle at 2

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,110
meters per second.

29
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,430
We used that information to
figure out the x and y

30
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,700
components of A's velocity.

31
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,840
So A's velocity in the y
direction was 1 meter per

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,420
second and A's velocity
in the x direction was

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,700
square root of 3.

34
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,090
And we used that information to
figure out A's momentum in

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,060
each direction.

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,010
We said well, the momentum in
the y direction must be 1

37
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,600
meter per second times A's mass,
which is 10 kilogram

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,370
meters per second.

39
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,170
Which I wrote-- what
I wrote here.

40
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,800
And then we figured out A's
momentum in the B direction

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,550
and we said well, that's
just going to be square

42
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,700
root of 3 times 10.

43
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,070
And that's 10 square
root of 3.

44
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,040
And then we used that
information to

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,680
solve for B's momentum.

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,070
Because we said well, B's
momentum plus A's momentum in

47
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,350
the x direction has
to add up to 30.

48
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,680
This was the x direction
before.

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
And we knew that B's momentum
plus A's momentum in the y

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,220
direction had to add
up to 0, right?

51
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,430
And so, since y's momentum going
upwards was 10 kilogram

52
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,580
meters per second, we knew
that B's momentum going

53
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,550
downwards would also
have to be 10

54
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,350
kilogram meters per second.

55
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,190
Or you could even say
it's negative 10.

56
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,870
And we figure that out based
on the fact that B

57
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,450
had half the mass.

58
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,910
That its velocity going down
was 2 meters per second.

59
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,140
And similarly, we knew that
A's momentum in the x

60
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,770
direction, which was 10 square
root of 3 kilogram meters per

61
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,830
second, plus B's momentum
in the x

62
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,730
direction is equal to 30.

63
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,800
And then we just subtracted out
and we got B's momentum in

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,630
the x direction.

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,270
And then we divided by B's
mass to get its velocity.

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,150
Which we got as 2.54.

67
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,340
So that's where I left off
and we were rushing.

68
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,140
And already, this gives you a
sense of what B is doing.

69
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,770
Although it's broken up into
the x and y direction.

70
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,800
Now if we wanted to simplify
this, if we wanted to kind of

71
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,470
write B's new velocity the same
way that the problem gave

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,490
us A's velocity, right?

73
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,090
They told us A's velocity was
2 meters per second at an

74
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,390
angle of 30 degrees.

75
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,010
We now have to use this
information to figure out B's

76
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,450
velocity and the angle of it.

77
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,150
And how do we do that?

78
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,890
Well this is just straight up
trigonometry at this point, or

79
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,360
really just straight
up geometry.

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Let me clear all of this.

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,680
And let's remember these two
numbers, 2.54 and minus 2.

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,590
So B, we learned that in the x
direction its velocity-- this

83
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,260
is all for B-- is equal to 2.54
meters per second and

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,900
then y direction, it
was moving down.

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,910
We could write this
as minus 2.

86
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,970
   

87
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,830
But I'll just write this as 2
meters per second downwards.

88
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,480
Right?

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,970
Same thing.

90
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,820
Minus 2 up is the same thing as
2 meters per second down.

91
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,410
So the resulting vector's
going to look

92
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,240
something like this.

93
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,725
When you add two vectors you
just put them-- put the one's

94
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:07,350
end at the beginning of the
other-- put them front to end,

95
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,320
like we did here.

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,760
And then you add them
together and this is

97
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,730
the resulting vector.

98
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,230
And I think you're used
to that at this point.

99
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,510
And now we have to figure out
this angle and this side.

100
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,100
Well this side is easy because
this is a right angle, so we

101
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,810
use Pythagorean theorem.

102
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,530
So this is going to be the
square root of 2.54 squared

103
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,460
plus 2 squared.

104
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,860
And what's 2.54 squared?

105
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:40,880
2.54 times-- whoops.

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,840
2.54 times 2.54 is
equal to 6.45.

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,530
So that's the square root of
6.45 plus 4, which equals the

108
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:02,070
square root of 10.45.

109
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,550
And take the square
root of that.

110
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,800
So that's 3.2, roughly.

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,200
So the resulting velocity in
this direction, whatever angle

112
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,550
this is, is 3.2 meters
per second.

113
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,250
And I just used Pythagorean
theorem.

114
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,440
So now all we have to do is
figure out the angle.

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,540
We could use really any of the
trig ratios because we know

116
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,730
all of the sides.

117
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,270
So I don't know, let's
use one that you

118
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,220
feel comfortable with.

119
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,920
Well let's use sine.

120
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,500
So sine of theta is
equal to what?

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,680
SOH CAH TOA.

122
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,820
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

123
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,020
So the opposite side is the y
direction, so that's 2, over

124
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,530
the hypotenuse, 3.2.

125
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:58,790
So 2 divided by 2 divided by 3.2
is equal to 0.625, which

126
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,265
equals 0.625.

127
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:03,350
So sine of theta equals 0.625.

128
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,510
And maybe you're not familiar
with arcsine yet because I

129
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,200
don't think I actually have
covered yet in the trig

130
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,780
modules, although I
will eventually.

131
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,090
So we know it's just the inverse
function of sine.

132
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,170
So sine of theta is
equal to 0.625.

133
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:25,920
Then we know that theta is equal
to the arcsine of 0.625.

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,235
This is essentially saying,
when you say arcsine, this

135
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:32,090
says, tell me the angle whose
sine is this number?

136
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,540
That's what arcsine is.

137
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,460
And we can take out Google
because it actually happens

138
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,310
that Google has a-- let's see.

139
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,680
Google actually-- it's an
automatic calculator.

140
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,590
So you could type in arcsine
on Google of 0.625.

141
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,460
Although I think the
answer they give

142
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,720
you will be in radians.

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,230
So I'll take that answer that
will be in radians and I want

144
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,300
to convert to degrees, so I
multiply it times 180 over pi.

145
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,850
That's just how I convert
from radians to degrees.

146
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,350
And let's see what I get.

147
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,670
So Google, you see, Google
says 38.68 degrees.

148
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,260
They multiplied the whole
thing times 180 and then

149
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,630
divided by pi, but that should
be the same thing.

150
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,225
So roughly 38.7 degrees
is theta.

151
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,090
Hope you understand that.

152
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,430
You could pause it here if
you don't, but let me

153
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,300
just write that down.

154
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,070
So it's 38 degrees.

155
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,080
So theta is equal
to 38.7 degrees.

156
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
So then we're done.

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,250
We figured out that
ball B gets hit.

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,950
This is ball B and it
got hit by ball A.

159
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,900
Ball A went off in that
direction at a 30 degree

160
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,880
angle, at a 30 degree angle
at 2 meters per second.

161
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,040
And now ball B goes at 38.--
or we could say roughly 39

162
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,320
degrees below the horizontal
at a velocity of 3.2 meters

163
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,700
per second.

164
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,270
And does this intuitively
make sense to you?

165
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,140
Well if you remember the problem
from before-- and I

166
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,860
know I erased everything.

167
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,540
Ball A had a mass of 10
kilograms while ball B had a

168
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,780
mass of 5 kilograms.
So it makes sense.

169
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,210
So let's think about just
the y direction.

170
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,680
Ball A, we figured out, the y
component of its velocity was

171
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,260
1 meter per second.

172
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,100
And ball B's y component is 2
meters per second downwards.

173
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,060
And does that makes sense?

174
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,000
Well sure.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,030
Because their momentums
have to add up to 0.

176
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,470
There was no y component of the
momentum before they hit

177
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,440
each other.

178
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,539
And in order for B to have the
same momentum going downwards

179
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,049
in the y direction as A going
upwards, its velocity has to

180
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,690
be essentially double, because
its mass is half.

181
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,680
And a similar logic, although
the cosine-- it doesn't work

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,550
out exactly like that.

183
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,450
But a similar logic would mean
that its overall velocity is

184
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:59,670
going to be faster than the-
than A's velocity.

185
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,680
And so what was I
just-- oh yeah.

186
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,550
My phone was ringing and
I got caught up.

187
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,730
My brain starts to
malfunction.

188
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,100
But anyway, as I was
saying, so just

189
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,220
intuitively it makes sense.

190
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,330
B has a smaller mass than A, so
it makes sense that-- one,

191
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,460
B will be going faster and
that it gets deflected a

192
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,350
little bit more as well.

193
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,800
The reason why it seems like
it gets deflected more is

194
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,095
because its y component
is more.

195
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,200
But anyway, that last piece is
just to kind of hopefully give

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,510
you a sense of what's happening
and I will see you

197
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,120
in the next video.

198
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
