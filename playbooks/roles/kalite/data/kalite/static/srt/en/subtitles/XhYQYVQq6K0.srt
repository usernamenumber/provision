1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:02,421
i'm here at stanford medical school

2
00:00:02,498 --> 00:00:05,400
with Morgan Theis and Dr. Laura Bachrach

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,867
and they're going to teach us some things.

4
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:11,133
Okay, so what are we going to learn about today?

5
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:14,067
I'd like to talk about precocious puberty

6
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:18,067
it seems to be on the minds of many parents these days

7
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:22,267
they worry that their child is developing too early,

8
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:26,600
they worry their child is going too small as a result,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,000
they worry their child is going to get picked on,

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,800
and they worry they might have done something wrong.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,867
Fed the child the wrong food, or exposed them to the wrong videos,

12
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,267
to cause this all to happen.

13
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:41,800
So could we just talk about what precocious puberty means,

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
it almost sounds like they've done something too soon,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,733
is that correct?

16
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:47,667
It's exactly true.

17
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:51,800
The normal process of puberty, in a girl, we think,

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,067
we used to think, started around the aged of 10,

19
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,600
with a little bit of breast development.

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,667
And around 6 months later, the girls would get

21
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,667
a little bit of pubic hair,

22
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,014
and around the age of 12 and 3/4 to 13

23
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,429
they'd get their first period.

24
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,751
Ok.

25
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,400
In boys, we used to think,

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,733
the process was starting a little later,

27
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,267
at about 11 and a half.

28
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,933
The boys would get some enlargement of the testes.

29
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,467
They'd get some pubic hair about a year later.

30
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:28,000
And by age 15 or so, they'd be mature.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,267
We have a definition of what's precocious,

32
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:37,533
uh, when there's signs of puberty before 8, in a girl,

33
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:41,933
or before 9, in a boy.

34
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:48,133
Ok. So, 8 or less in a girl, would be precocious,

35
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,467
and that's for the breast development?

36
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:52,400
For any signs of puberty:

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
the breasts, the pubic hair or the period

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,800
would be precocious if it happened before the age of 8 in a girl.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,467
And in a boy, before the age of 9.

40
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:10,867
Now this has become a little bit controversial

41
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:15,067
because there was one very large pediatric study

42
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:19,333
that involved over 17 000 girls

43
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:24,200
that found that as many as 25% of african american

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,133
girls would have sign of puberty before 8,

45
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:31,600
and as many 7% of the white girls had some

46
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,533
signs of puberty before age 8.

47
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:37,333
But we're still basically using these guidelines.

48
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,933
Not to say that this is definetely abnormal, but

49
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:43,267
this is something we're going to evaluate.

50
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:46,267
If we see signs of puberty before those age landmarks.

51
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,200
Ok, so it sounds like there's a lot of variability,

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,667
it's kind of hard to know in any individual case,

53
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,933
whether it's normal or not, but we have to have

54
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,200
some kind of threshold for which we're going to

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,533
work someone up to make sure everything is normal.

56
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,800
You hit on a really important word.

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
And that is variability.

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,400
And a lot of this variability, uh, is determined by genetics.

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,867
So part of what we always need to know is

60
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:13,133
the timing of development in the family.

61
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,267
So when did mom get her first menstrual period,

62
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:20,200
when did dad get his puberty and growth spurt?

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,800
So that's part of it, genetics,

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
and we need to know that, take that into account:

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,600
If mom had her first period at 10 and started

66
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,133
her breasts at 8

67
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,800
it might be perfectly normal for her daugher.

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,133
If mom's period were at 14 and her daughter has

69
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,133
breast development at 7 and a half

70
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,200
it's more worrysome.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Ok.

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,800
Ok, the second factor that seems to be contributing,

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
potentially,

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,867
is the overnutrition of our young people.

75
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,867
Oh, yes.

76
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,600
And in the particular study that I mentioned to you,

77
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
where they looked at over 17 000 children,

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
at least for the white population,

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,267
the could explain the earlier signs of puberty

80
00:03:56,267 --> 00:04:00,400
as an association with a high body mass index.

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,733
So it looked as if, if you overnourish your child

82
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,267
you may speed along their growth, and eventually,

83
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:09,200
potentially, speed along the onset

84
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,800
of puberty.

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,067
Now, this did not hold up as an association in the

86
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,533
african american population, so there's other factors

87
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,267
going on there.

88
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,333
But that's something that we rtake into account.

89
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,800
THe bottom line is,

90
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,533
the child may present with some signs of early puberty,

91
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:29,267
mom or dad get worried,

92
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:31,200
they go to the pediatrician,

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,200
and the pediatrician has to decide what's going on.

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Ok, now, JUST Backing up a little bit, is this a problem?

95
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,133
I mean, what's the problem with, say, a 7 year old girl

96
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:45,867
starting puberty, or, uh, an 8 year old boy

97
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,667
starting puberty early?

98
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,933
I imagine there could be some social implications

99
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:49,933
(as you mentionened)

100
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,667
but what are sort of the things

101
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,733
we worry about?

102
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,667
Well, that's an importand question,

103
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,933
because it comes up not only how far do we go to

104
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,800
evaluate them, but how far do we go

105
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
to treat them?

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,467
So, one of the concerns parents have,

107
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,267
relates to their final height.

108
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:07,800
So, if they start their growth spurt early in life,

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,533
and close it off early in life,

110
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,867
are them gonna cheat themselves

111
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,933
out of some final height?

112
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:14,533
Right.

113
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,133
So height is a concern.

114
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,067
And its impact really depends upon how young the child is.

115
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,533
A three year old going into puberty

116
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,400
is definetely going to end up short

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,533
if we don't do something.

118
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,400
A seven and a half old girl is

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
probably not going to be altered by this

120
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,467
in terms of height.

121
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:33,200
The second concern is definetely what you

122
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,867
brought up, in terms of social concern.

123
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:39,733
Parents worry their child may behave in an older way,

124
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,400
or be treat in a way that

125
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,000
they're not quite ready for.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,933
They mey get unwarranted attention

127
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,333
from people because they look older.

128
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,800
And there is even potential concern for abuse,

129
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,133
sexual abuse.

130
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:53,633
Um, right.

131
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,600
So those are the usual parental concerns

132
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,800
for why they bring the child in.

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,667
The other concern they have is, often

134
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,467
"what am I doing wrong".

135
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:02,967
There are a lot of questions about

136
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,733
"should I have fed my child organic food?"

137
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,933
"what about the soap i was using?"

138
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,733
"what about the soap operas my child was watching?"

139
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,667
You know, they're really

140
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,933
concerned about something they might have done.

141
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,667
And they worry about these additives in ourplastics,

142
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,267
in our theeth sealants, etc...

143
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:21,467
They worry about evils inour environment.

144
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,133
Okay.

145
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,267
So things that you address in the visit that

146
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,400
you have with them are definetely

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,667
some of the, the concerns that parent have

148
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,933
about what they could have done differently.

149
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,800
Exactly. We start out, assessing

150
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
in a sort of a systematic way.

151
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,867
The first question we want to know, is

152
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:40,533
when did this all start?

153
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,333
And what did they notice.

154
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,600
And it's really important

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
to break down the signs of puberty,

156
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,667
because different hormones contribute to

157
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,267
the different signs.

158
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,533
For example, in a girl, if she is presenting with

159
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:55,400
some body odor, some acne, and some pubic hair,

160
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
but no signs of any breast development,

161
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,333
that leads us down the road to

162
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,200
worry about what we call her androgens

163
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,333
or her male hormones.

164
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,800
If a girl comes in with just breast development

165
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,732
but none of the body hair

166
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,933
or body odor, we think, aha! she's been

167
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:13,800
exposed to estrogens.

168
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,667
And so we get a lot from the physical exam in

169
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,800
terms of thinking what hormones to go after.

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
okay, so even though the definitions of precocious

171
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
is just any of these

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,467
different physical developments happening

173
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,933
too soon, the combination that you see

174
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,733
is going to direct what yo uthing is going on

175
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,600
wit hthem clinically.

176
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
Exactly.

177
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Ok

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,733
It will make us more or less worried

179
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:38,133
and it will take us down one avenue or another,

180
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:41,267
thinking about what could be wrong,

181
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,800
what level of abnormality in the hormone system is at work.

182
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,200
Ok. Can I ask you a question, just curious, so

183
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,667
what are the most common diagnosis given

184
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,133
to people coming in with their kids, that are

185
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,067
concerned for precocious puberty?

186
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,467
The common diagnosis, is "variations are normal".

187
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,800
Aha.

188
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,333
There is a condition called

189
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,800
"isolated premature adrenarche" which is a

190
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
fancy doctor way of saying

191
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,533
the adrenal glands producting their

192
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:16,600
hormones, we see pubic hair, underarm hair, and acne.

193
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,333
Uh... We also can see isolated

194
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,800
breast development in little toddler girls

195
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,333
that's not concerning.

196
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,467
So that would just go away, or?

197
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,667
Yes. Typically that begins between

198
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:29,000
six months and two years and

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
goes away.

200
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,667
But even within the more full blown cases,

201
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:37,200
where we're seeing breast and the pubic hair

202
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,667
in a girl, or the enlagrement of the testes

203
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,200
and the pubic hair in a boy, where's it's full on,

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,067
full blown puberty, it may be idiopathic,

205
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,800
or not pathological.

206
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,267
We think that in girls,

207
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:57,267
who develop fully, 95% of the time, even if they

208
00:08:57,267 --> 00:09:00,133
have the full blown puberty,

209
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,733
it's idiopathic, or not pathological.

210
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:06,400
Whereas in boys, about 50% of the time, there is pathology.

211
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,133
So the condition is less common on boys, but

212
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,133
when it occurs in boys, it's more worrisome.

213
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:12,867
Oh, interesting.

214
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:17,600
So it's less common for boys to have any signs of

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,467
precocious puberty, but when it does happen you worry more.

216
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,333
Exactly.

217
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,733
Because it's more likeyl to be something bad.

218
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,267
Exactly.

219
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:24,867
Ok.

220
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:30,667
So I'm guessing as an endocrinologist,

221
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,467
once you've sort of ruled out the normal things, then you start th

222
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:36,200
then you start thinking more about

223
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,600
sort of what's going on in terms of all the

224
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
different hormones that are controlling the

225
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,300
se

226
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,800
things, which maybe is something that

227
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,533
we'll talk about in a different

228
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,600
lecture

229
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
exactly.

230
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,000
is there any other sort of general things

231
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,600
that you wanted to adress when

232
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,533
we'll just talking about...

233
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,867
I think the general advice I would give to a parent

234
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:56,800
if see signs of puberty in their child,

235
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,933
before 8 in a girl, before 9 in a boy,

236
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,867
they should at least question their pediatrician

237
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,867
about it, uh, and the pediatrician should do

238
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,667
a complete exam, and the

239
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,400
other factor that needs to be looked at carefully is growth,

240
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,200
because a child who is truly in puberty will have a growth spurt.

241
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,267
So, those are things that parents can be

242
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:17,800
aware of at home, but I think it's

243
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,400
important that the parent asks the pediatrician about it,

244
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
if they are concerned.

245
00:10:23,400 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, well thank you so much.
