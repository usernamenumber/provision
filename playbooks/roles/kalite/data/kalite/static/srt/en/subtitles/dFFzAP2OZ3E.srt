1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,820
I'm going to do one more
video on entropy.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,180
Maybe I'll do more
in the future.

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,970
But I thought I would at least
right now do one more, because

5
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,080
I really want to make clear
the idea of entropy as a

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,290
macrostate variable.

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,590
So let me write that down.

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:20,320
An S, which is entropy, is
a macrostate variable.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm going to write macro
in bold red.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,010
It's a macrostate
state variable.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,500
And I want to emphasize this.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,780
And I talked a little bit about
it in my previous video,

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,590
but I think even then I wasn't
as exact as I needed to be.

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,850
And the reason why I want to
say it's macro is because

15
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,920
there's a very strong temptation
to point to

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,520
particular micro states and
say, does this have higher

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,570
entropy or lower entropy
than another?

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,830
For example, the classic one.

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,430
Even I did this.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,750
Actually, let me make a
bigger, thicker line.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:02,360
So you have this box that
has a divider in it.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,090
We've gone through this
multiple times.

23
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,710
Let me draw the divider
like right there.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,960
OK.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,530
So at first if we have a
system where all of the

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,550
molecules are over here-- so
that's our first scenario.

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,510
And then our second scenario,
we've studied this a lot.

28
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,190
We blow up the wall here.

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,870
And we actually calculated
the entropy.

30
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,630
Control.

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:29,870
OK.

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,240
Let me copy it and then
I'm going to paste it.

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,210
Let me put these next
to each other.

34
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,210
All right.

35
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,540
So I have these two things.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,360
And then the second time,
I blew away this wall.

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,200
Let me blow it away.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,120
Let me erase the wall there.

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,230
And then we said, once the
system reaches equilibrium

40
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,640
again-- remember, these
macrostate variables, like

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
pressure, like volume, like
temperature, like entropy, are

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,240
only defined once the system
is in equilibrium.

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,660
So once the system is in
equilibrium again, these

44
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,305
particles are now-- I wanted the
same number of particles,

45
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:11,840
so let me erase some of these
particles, let me move them.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,160
Let me see if I can
select some.

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:23,920
   

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,110
There.

49
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,380
So we'll have a more even--
Let me just redraw.

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,850
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 particles.

51
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,980
Let me erase what I have. And
I'll make it with a more even

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,230
distribution.

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,020
   

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,770
So then, once I blow away the
wall, I might have 1, 2, 3, 4,

55
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,930
5, 6, 7, 8.

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,520
Now, the reason why I'm doing
all of this is because there's

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,660
a temptation to say that this
state, what I just drew you

58
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,080
when I, you know, made sure to
blow these away and draw 8

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,600
more, I drew a microstate.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,850
This is a microstate.

61
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,900
   

62
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,080
Anytime someone is actually
drawing molecules for you,

63
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,330
they're drawing a microstate.

64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,580
   

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,680
Now, I want to be very clear.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,260
This microstate does not have
more entropy than this

67
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,310
microstate.

68
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,380
In fact, microstates you
don't have entropy.

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,140
Entropy does not make sense.

70
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,670
What you can say is a system--
and this time, I'm going to

71
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,050
draw it without the particles.

72
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,900
That if I have a container
that is this big, that

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,210
contains-- so it has
some volume.

74
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,700
So volume is equal to v1.

75
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,840
Its temperature is equal
to a t1, and it has 8

76
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,860
particles in it.

77
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,230
This has some entropy
associated with it.

78
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,840
And what we can say, is if we
were to double the size of

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,880
this container, which we did by
blowing away that wall, now

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,160
all of a sudden our volume is
equal to 2 times v1, if we say

81
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,100
this is double.

82
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,330
Our temperature is still
equal to t1.

83
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,080
We saw that a few videos ago.

84
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,445
And we still have 8 molecules.

85
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,030
   

86
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,940
The entropy of this
system is higher.

87
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,180
So now entropy is higher.

88
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,500
And I want to make this very
clear, because you never see

89
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,279
it drawn this way.

90
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,029
People always want to draw
the actual molecules.

91
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,079
But that confuses the issue.

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,380
When you draw actual molecules,
you're showing a

93
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,010
particular state.

94
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,200
For example, this system, if
we were to actually measure

95
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
the microstate, it could be--
there's a very, very

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,310
infinitesimally probability--
but all of the molecules, all

97
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,160
8 molecules might
be right there.

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,380
I mean, it's almost, you know,
you could wait for the whole

99
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,500
universe to come and go, and
it might not happen.

100
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,270
But there is some probability
it would happen.

101
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,160
So you can't assign entropy
to a particular state.

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,110
All you can do is assign it
to a particular system.

103
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,610
I want to be clear about that.

104
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,410
So even I talked about
a clean and dirty

105
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,060
room and all of that.

106
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,690
Clean versus dirty room.

107
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,650
   

108
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,220
And the point I was making is,
the entropy of a room is not

109
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,840
dependent on its cleanliness
or its dirtiness.

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,960
In fact, you could kind
of view these

111
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,670
as states of a room.

112
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,980
But even more, these
really aren't even

113
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,890
states of the room.

114
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,390
Because when a room is clean, or
a room is static at a macro

115
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,640
level, they're static.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,400
   

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,760
If my books or lying like--
you know, sometimes people

118
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,390
look at a deck of cards and
say, oh, if I have all my

119
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,940
cards stacked up like this, or
if I have all my cards that

120
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,320
are all messy like that, that
this has higher entropy.

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,680
And I want to make
it very clear.

122
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,740
I mean, maybe you can kind
of make an analogy.

123
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,090
But that's not the case.

124
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,960
Both of these systems
are macrostates.

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,420
For example, it's not like
these cards are vibrating

126
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,730
around any more than
these cards are.

127
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,660
It's not like these can take
on more configurations than

128
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,970
these cards can.

129
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,770
So when you talk about entropy,
you're trying to take

130
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,800
a macro variable that's
describing at a micro level.

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,710
And the cards themselves are not
the micro level, because

132
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,820
they're not vibrating around
continuously due to some

133
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,220
kinetic energy or whatever.

134
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,410
It's the cards' molecules that
are at the micro level.

135
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,000
And if these cards, if you have
the same mass of cars as

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,490
you have here, and if they're
at the same temperature, the

137
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,120
molecules in these cards can
take on just as many states as

138
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,500
the molecules in these cards.

139
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,230
So they're going to have
the same entropy.

140
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,380
Entropy is a macrostate
variable, or a macrostate

141
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,500
function, that describes
the number of states a

142
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,930
system can take on.

143
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,790
So here, I would view the
cards as a system.

144
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,580
And what we care about is not
the number of configurations

145
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,900
the cards themselves
can take on.

146
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,280
The cards aren't constantly
vibrating and changing from

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,330
one thing to another.

148
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,740
It's at the atomic level, at the
molecular level, that as

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,110
long as we're above absolute
zero, which we pretty much

150
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,460
always are, things are going
to be vibrating around

151
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,150
continuously, and continuously
changing its state.

152
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,460
So it's almost impossible
to measure the state.

153
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,860
And since it's impossible to
measure the state, we use

154
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,280
something like entropy to
say, well, how many

155
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,310
states can we have?

156
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,990
And I mean, all of these things,
entropy, whether we

157
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,580
call it internal energy, whether
we look at entropy,

158
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,730
whether we look at pressure,
volume, temperature.

159
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,810
These are all, if you can think
about it in some way,

160
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,740
these are shortcuts around
having to actually measure

161
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,990
what each molecule is doing.

162
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,600
And entropy, you can kind of
view it as a meta shortcut.

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,060
I mean, temperature tells you
average kinetic energy, this

164
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,600
tells you all of the energy
that's in it, this tells you,

165
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,010
you know, how frequently the
molecules are bumping against

166
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,220
a certain area.

167
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,030
This tells you, on average, kind
of where the outermost

168
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,280
molecules are.

169
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,130
Entropy is kind of a, you
can almost view it

170
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,260
as a metastate variable.

171
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,030
It tells you how many states,
how many micro

172
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,570
states can we take on?

173
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,490
And so I just want to make this
very clear, because this

174
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,250
is often confused, and there's
a very, very, very strong

175
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,280
temptation to point to a
particular state and to say

176
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,820
that that has higher entropy
than another, that somehow

177
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,450
this state is more entropic
than that state.

178
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,330
That's not the case.

179
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,310
This system is more entropic
than this system,

180
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,560
than this half box.

181
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,960
It has more volume.

182
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,920
If it has the same temperature
with more volume, then its

183
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,860
particles can take on more
possible scenarios at any

184
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,560
given moment in time.

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,670
Anyway, hopefully you found
that a little bit useful.

186
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,900
I just want to make it very,
very, very clear.

187
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,059
Because this is often, often,
often confused.

188
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,650
It is a macrostate variable for
a system, where a system

189
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,429
is composed of things that are
bumping around randomly.

190
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,210
Every millionth of a second,
they're changing states, so

191
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,740
it's very hard to even measure
one of the microstates.

192
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,750
You can't point to a microstate,
and say, oh, this

193
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,820
has higher entropy
than another.

194
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,190
Anyway.

195
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,440
See you in the next video.

196
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,030
