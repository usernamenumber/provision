1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,150
We learned several videos ago
that if I had an infinite

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:08,284
uniformly charged plane-- let me
draw one right here, and I

4
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:09,960
won't draw it infinite and
I'll tell you why in a

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,450
second-- that if we had an
infinite uniformly charged

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,600
plane, and let's say this
one's positive, that the

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,935
electric field generated
by it is constant.

8
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:29,030
   

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,290
Those are the field lines.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,890
They should all be
the same size.

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,210
And the strength of the field,
or the magnitude of the field,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:45,820
is equal to 2 times Coulomb's
constant times pi times the

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,750
charge density of the plate.

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,130
So if this is infinite-- so
what was charge density?

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,450
We defined it when we proved
that this truly is a uniform

16
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,140
electric field, but what
is charge density?

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:03,280
Charge density is just the total
amount of charge divided

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,290
by the area, or charge
per area.

19
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,560
Well, if we have an infinite
plane, the area's going to be

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,110
infinite, and so if this is a
constant number, this is also

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,740
going to be infinite, so it's
kind of hard to work with.

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,350
But what we also know is that
when we have a non-infinite

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,210
plane that has some finite area,
that near the center of

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,250
it and fairly close to it, it
approximates an infinite

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,780
uniformly charged plane.

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,180
So with that said, let's see if
we can figure out some of

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,830
the properties of the voltage
and how the voltage relates to

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,350
the charge.

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,130
If we were to have two
parallel-- let me draw it

30
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,040
before I say it, because I
think saying it'll just

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,850
confuse it.

32
00:01:51,850 --> 00:02:02,350
So let's say I have two plates,
that plate-- and then

33
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,290
I'll do this one in a different
color-- and I have

34
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:11,650
that plate, and let's say
they're the same size and they

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,470
both have area A.

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,860
Let's say that I place plus
Q worth of charges here.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,460
So this is plus Q so this is
positively charged, right?

38
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,010
I could draw a bunch
of charges here.

39
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,590
Let's say this is minus Q, so
this is negatively charged.

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,860
So what's the electric field
going to look like

41
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,730
between these two?

42
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,070
Well, it's essentially going to
be the combination of the

43
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,400
electric field generated by
this plate on top of the

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
electric field generated
by this plate.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,290
And they're both going to be
constant close to the center,

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,970
assuming that they're
reasonably-- and let's say

47
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,220
that they're d apart.

48
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,140
Assuming that d isn't too big,
near the center we're going to

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,660
have a constant electric
field.

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,070
For example, this green one is
going to be generating-- its

51
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,470
field lines are going to look
something like this.

52
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,200
Near the center,
it's constant.

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,450
These are meant to
look constant.

54
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,500
   

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,250
Near the center, it'll look like
that, and it'll start to

56
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,250
bulge out when you
get to the edges.

57
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,770
   

58
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,440
Once again, near the center,
it's constant.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,635
That one should've
been at an angle.

60
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:22,330
They start to bulge out,
and it'll look

61
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,830
something like that.

62
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,120
And similarly, this purple plate
will generate a constant

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,630
electric field, and since it's
negatively charged, the field

64
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,470
lines will be going towards it,
not away from it, so its

65
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,020
field lines are going to look
something like this.

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,890
Near the center, they'll be
constant, and its field lines

67
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,140
are going to look something
like that.

68
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,640
   

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,380
As you can see, they're going
to be of the same magnitude

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,730
and in the same direction,
and they also

71
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,820
will bulge out there.

72
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,090
So the big picture is that you
just kind of have twice the

73
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,530
electric field as you would have
if you just had one of

74
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,920
these plates.

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,690
So let's say we're operating
near the center of these,

76
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,940
where we have roughly a constant
electric field and

77
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,620
see if we can figure out the
relationship between the

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,760
voltage across these two plates
and the area, and maybe

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,120
the distance between
the two plates.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,260
So we know that the electric
field generated by any one of

81
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,100
these charge plates-- I'll do it
in the blue of this color.

82
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,190
So for the bottom plate right
here, what is the electric

83
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,810
field generated?

84
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,930
It's 2K pi times sigma.

85
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,270
Sigma is just the total charge
divided by the area.

86
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,640
So Q/A, right?

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,570
And we know that the total
electric field generated by

88
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,890
this one is going to be
essentially the same thing.

89
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,370
I mean, we could say it's a
minus, a negative, because

90
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,110
it's going towards it, but it's

91
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,140
essentially the same thing.

92
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,800
Because we see that they overlap
just drawing the field

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,750
line, so the electric field
from that one, and we know

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,570
that they go in the
same direction.

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,155
If this was somehow-- well, this
is negative, so the field

96
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:08,850
lines go towards it.

97
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,300
So plus 2K pi and this is Q/A.

98
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,640
We could have said minus and
then had a minus Q/A, but we

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,730
know that they go into same
direction, so we know that

100
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,820
they're going to be additive.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,950
And so we know that the total
electric field is

102
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,625
going to be 4K pi Q/A.

103
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,670
   

104
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,320
So now we know the
exact strength of

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,490
the electric field.

106
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,220
Let's see if we can figure out
the voltage difference between

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,850
this point and this point.

108
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,420
What was voltage difference,
just as a review?

109
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,680
Well, voltage difference is
the electrical potential

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,200
energy per charge if the charge
was here versus here.

111
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,500
So how much more potential
energy per coulomb is there

112
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,390
for a charge to be here
relative to here?

113
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,220
So another way to view it is a
charge here, a positive charge

114
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,170
here, because by default we're
always assuming a positive

115
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,100
charge when we talk about
positive numbers and the

116
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,820
direction of the field lines
or what the positive

117
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,840
charge would do.

118
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,180
So by default, a positive charge
here really wants to go

119
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,500
up to this negative plate,
although we later learned that

120
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,500
most of the movement in
electronics and electricity,

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,080
it's actually the negative
charge that's moving.

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,385
It's the electrons moving.

123
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,370
But let's say we did
have a positive ion

124
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,500
or a positive charge.

125
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,170
The voltage is a measure of if
any charge is here, how badly

126
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,550
does it want to move to this
point if it has a way to move?

127
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,500
If we have air here or if we
have a vacuum here, it might

128
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,740
be difficult or impossible
for it to move up here.

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,310
But maybe if we were to connect
a wire where the

130
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,360
charges could freely conduct,
then it will move.

131
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,420
And the voltage is just
kind of how badly

132
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,210
does it want to move?

133
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,990
You could almost view it
as electrical pressure.

134
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,290
And maybe I'll do a whole video
on trying to get an

135
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,330
intuitive understanding of
voltage, because that really

136
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,040
is probably the most important
thing to get an intuitive

137
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,240
understanding of, if you ever
want to study electrical

138
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,900
engineering or whatever.

139
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,190
But anyway, back
to the problem.

140
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,060
We know that the combined
electric field is this, right?

141
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,590
It goes upwards in
that direction.

142
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,840
So what is the electric
potential at this point

143
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,430
relative to this point or
the potential difference

144
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,380
from here to here?

145
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,220
Well, that's the amount of
energy per charge it would

146
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:42,650
take to move a positive charge
from here to there, right?

147
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,810
Remember, electric potential
energy is the amount of work

148
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,210
necessary to move a charge from
there to there, and then

149
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,810
the voltage is how much
to do it per charge.

150
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,910
Let me write that down.

151
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,730
So the work necessary to move a
charge from there to there--

152
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:07,010
let's say a 1-coulomb charge, it
will be 1 coulomb times the

153
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,060
electric field, because we're
always going to have to be

154
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,660
going against the
electric field.

155
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,260
So we have to apply an equal
and opposite force.

156
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,360
So the force that is going to
be the electric field-- so

157
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,750
far, this just generates this
force. coulomb times electric

158
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,430
field, charge times electric
field, tells us the force on

159
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,200
the charge, right?

160
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,410
That's force, and
then we have to

161
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,380
multiply that times distance.

162
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,020
Force times distance.

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,590
So we see the work necessary
is going to be the electric

164
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:42,929
field times d joules-- the J is
joules-- and so what is the

165
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,210
voltage difference or the
electric potential difference

166
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,560
between this point
and this point?

167
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,720
Let's call that point a.

168
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,450
Let's call that point b.

169
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:03,040
So Va minus Vb, which is the
voltage difference, that's

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
essentially the electric
potential energy difference

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,580
divided by the charge.

172
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,330
Or, per charge.

173
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,900
Well, here, the charge was just
1, so we can just divide

174
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:18,380
by 1, and we see that it is
equal to the electric field

175
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,410
times the distance.

176
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,200
And the units are going to be
joules because we divided both

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,570
sides by charge joules per
coulomb, or volts, right?

178
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,600
That's just the units.

179
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,380
So what does that equal?

180
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,250
So the voltage difference-- so
we can say change in voltage.

181
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,130
The voltage difference is equal
to the electric field,

182
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:51,720
which we know is constant 4K
pi Q over A times distance.

183
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,020
Or we could rewrite this.

184
00:09:53,020 --> 00:10:00,300
Let's see if we could write
Q as a function of V.

185
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,220
So if we just do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation, we

186
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,110
can get Q is equal to what?

187
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,800
We would essentially divide
both sides by 4 pi Kd and

188
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,350
multiply both sides by
A, so we would get A

189
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:29,680
over 4K pi d voltage.

190
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,960
And why is this interesting?

191
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,030
Why did I go through all of
this work to get this

192
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,870
relationship?

193
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,780
Well, what it shows you, if you
look at this, if we assume

194
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,150
that the area of the plates
aren't changing-- that's a

195
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,630
constant; this is definitely a
constant-- and if we assume

196
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,980
that the distance between the
plates don't change, what we

197
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,690
see is that there's a
proportional difference

198
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,910
between the voltage and the
amount of the combined charge

199
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,080
in the plates.

200
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,680
And that's interesting because,
before doing this,

201
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,240
maybe voltage is somehow
proportional to the square of

202
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,435
the charges or to the square
root, but now we know that

203
00:11:06,435 --> 00:11:08,280
it's directly proportionally.

204
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,430
And actually, this term right
here has a name, and it is

205
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,290
called capacitance.

206
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,220
And so another way of rewriting
this, if we divide

207
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:33,660
both sides by voltage, we get
Q/V is equal to 1 over 4K pi

208
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,270
area over distance.

209
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,340
And so what it essentially says
is that the amount of

210
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,730
energy that-- well, actually,
I don't want to

211
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,520
go into that yet.

212
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,630
But for a given configuration,
and the configuration is

213
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,030
defined by the area of the
plates and the distance-- for

214
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,890
a given configuration, if I know
the amount of charge that

215
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,000
I put onto the plates, if I did
a minus Q here and a plus

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,900
Q here, I know the voltage
across the

217
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,875
plates or vice versa.

218
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,090
If I know the voltage across
the plates and I know its

219
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,300
configuration, I know how much
charge there is, and this is

220
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,010
called capacitance, and the
unit for capacitance

221
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,990
is called the Farad.

222
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,590
And if you become an electrical
engineer or even

223
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,350
take a couple of electrical
engineering courses, you'll

224
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,370
become very familiar
with this.

225
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,650
And one other thing to point
out; this term right here,

226
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,200
just so you know a little
bit of terminology.

227
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
This term right here.

228
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:36,630
This 1 over 4K pi, this is often
called epsilon nought,

229
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,220
or just epsilon, and that's
called the permittivity of

230
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,560
free space or permittivity
of the vacuum.

231
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,460
And maybe in a future lecture
or a future video, I'll talk

232
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,010
more about why it's
called that.

233
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,910
But anyway, I'm already well
over the time limit.

234
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,260
So I just wanted to give you a
sense of, one, that you can

235
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,230
calculate the voltage across
what we call, in

236
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,600
this case, a capacitor.

237
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,430
It has capacitance.

238
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,385
That voltage, you can
kind of view it as

239
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,170
the electric pressure.

240
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,800
How bad does the charge here
want to move here?

241
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,750
And if you put a wire here,
you'll learn in a second-- not

242
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,380
in a second, in several
videos-- that

243
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,575
that charge will flow.

244
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,610
Or actually the negative charges
will flow this way and

245
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,310
generate current.

246
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,780
And we'll do that when we start
learning a little bit

247
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,360
more about electricity.

248
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,120
For any given configuration,
it has a corresponding

249
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,030
capacitance, and then given
that capacitance, if I put

250
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,910
some amount of charge, I can
figure out the voltage, or if

251
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,070
I know there's some voltage, I
can figure out the charge.

252
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,350
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
