1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,280
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,860
Well, in the last presentation,
we described a

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,200
situation where you had
a bunch of borrowers.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,160
They needed $1 billion
collectively, because there's

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,760
1000 of them and they each
needed $1 million

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,810
to buy their house.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,790
And they borrowed the money
essentially from a special

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,530
purpose entity.

9
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,580
They borrowed it from their
local mortgage broker, who

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,250
then sold it to a bank, or to
an investment bank, who

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,770
created the special purpose
entity, and then they IPO the

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,840
special purpose entity and raise
the money from people

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,700
who bought the mortgage-backed
securities.

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,580
But essentially what happened
is the investors in the

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,940
mortgage-backed securities
provided the money to the

16
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,160
special purpose entity to

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,830
essentially loan to the borrowers.

18
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,120
And then the reason why we call
it a security is because,

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,040
not only are these people
getting this 10% a year, but

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,030
if they want to -- let's say
that you had one of these

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,220
mortgage-backed securities and
you paid $1000 for it.

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,700
And you're getting this 10%
a year, but then all of a

23
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,390
sudden, you think that the whole
mortgage industry is

24
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,950
about to collapse, a bunch of
people are going to default,

25
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,380
and you want out.

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,860
If you just gave someone
a loan, there'd be

27
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,720
no way to get out.

28
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,570
You'd have to sell that
loan to someone else.

29
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,380
But if you have a
mortgage-backed security, you

30
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,070
can actually trade the security
with someone else.

31
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,980
And they might pay you, who
knows, they might pay more

32
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,780
than $1000.

33
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,460
They might pay you less.

34
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,880
But there will be at least some
type of a market in the

35
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,240
security, so you could have what
you could call liquidity.

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
Liquidity just means that
I have the security

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,740
and I can sell it.

38
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,340
I could trade it just like I
could trade a share of IBM or

39
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,600
I could trade a share
of Microsoft.

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,800
But like we said before, this
security, in order to place a

41
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,020
value on it, you have to do some
type of analysis of what

42
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,240
you think it's worth.

43
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,180
Or what you think the real
interest will be after you

44
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,520
take into account people
pre-paying their mortgage,

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,340
people defaulting on their
mortgage, and other things

46
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,770
like short-term interest rates,
et cetera, et cetera.

47
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,280
And there is only maybe a small
group of people who are

48
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,870
sophisticated enough to be able
to figure that out to

49
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,470
make some type of models and
who knows if even they're

50
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,720
sophisticated enough.

51
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,440
There might be a whole other
class of investors

52
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,340
here, say this guy.

53
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,800
He would love to kind of invest
in securities, but he

54
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
thinks this is too risky.

55
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,940
He'd be willing to take a lower
return as long as he was

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,979
allowed to invest in less
risky investments.

57
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,530
Maybe by law, maybe he's a
pension fund or he's some type

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,140
of a mutual fund, that's forced
to invest in something

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,860
of a certain grade.

60
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:26,230
And say that there's another
investor here, and he thinks

61
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,180
that this is boring.

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,350
You know, 9%, 10%.

63
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,160
Who cares about that?

64
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,370
He wants to see bigger
and bigger returns.

65
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,750
So there's no way for him to
invest in this security and to

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,810
get better returns.

67
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,510
So now we're going to take this
mortgage-backed security

68
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,650
and introduce one step further
kind of permutation or

69
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,910
derivative of what this is.

70
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,930
That's all derivatives are.

71
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,730
You've probably heard the term
derivatives and people do a

72
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,320
lot of hand-waving saying, oh,
it's a more complicated form

73
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,030
of security.

74
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,770
All derivative means is you take
one type of asset and you

75
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,120
slice and dice it in a way to
spread the risk, or whatever.

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,950
And so you create a
derivative asset.

77
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,450
It's derived from the
original asset.

78
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,000
So let's see how we could use
this same asset pool, the same

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,810
pool of loans, and satisfy
all of these people.

80
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,630
Satisfy this guy, who wants
maybe a lower return but lower

81
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,680
risk, and this guy, who's
willing to take a little bit

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,410
higher risk in exchange
for higher return.

83
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,060
So now in this situation, we
have the same borrowers.

84
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,390
They borrowed $1 billion
collectively, right, because

85
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,310
there's 1000 of them, et
cetera, et cetera.

86
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,410
And they're still a special
purpose entity, but now,

87
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,780
instead of just slicing up the
special purpose entity a

88
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,680
million ways, what we're going
to do is we're going to split

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,810
it up first into three, what
we could call, tranches.

90
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,190
A tranche is just a bucket,
if you will, of the asset.

91
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,370
And we're going to call the
three tranches: equity,

92
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,140
mezzanine, and senior.

93
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,710
These are the words
that are commonly

94
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,350
used in this industry.

95
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,010
A senior just means, if this
entity were to lose money,

96
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,810
these people get their money
back first. So it's the least

97
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,220
risk out of all of
the tranches.

98
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,900
Mezzanine, that just means
the next level or middle.

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,890
And these guys are some
place in between.

100
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,850
They have a little bit more
risk, and they still get a

101
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,300
little bit more reward than
senior, but they have less

102
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
risk than this equity tranche.

103
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,350
Equity tranche.

104
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,060
These are the people who
first lose money.

105
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,040
Let's say some of these
borrowers start defaulting.

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,190
It all comes out of the
equity tranche.

107
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,770
So that's what protects the
senior tranche and the

108
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,770
mezzanine tranche
from defaults.

109
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,580
So in this situation what we did
is we raised -- out of the

110
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,690
$1 billion we needed -- $400
million from the senior

111
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,990
tranche, $300 million from the
mezzanine tranche, and then

112
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,810
$300 million from the
equity tranche.

113
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,730
The $400 million senior tranche
we raised from

114
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,880
1000 senior securities,
collateralized debt

115
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,380
obligations.

116
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,815
These are these, right here.

117
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,870
Say there were 400,000 of these
and these each cost

118
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:07,990
$1000, right?

119
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,030
Let's say these cost $1000.

120
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,690
And we issued 400,000
of these.

121
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,780
So we raised $400 million.

122
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,890
Let's say we give these
guys a 6% return.

123
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,100
And you might say, 6%,
that's not much.

124
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,920
But these guys, it is pretty low
risk, because in order for

125
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,910
them to not get their 6%, the
value of this $1 billion asset

126
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,700
or these $1 billion loans, would
have to go down below

127
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,460
$400 million.

128
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,440
Maybe I'll do a little bit more
math in another example.

129
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,370
But I think it'll start
making sense to you.

130
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,900
For example, every year we said
there's going to be $100

131
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,930
million in payments, right?

132
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,170
Because it's 10%.

133
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,800
$100 million in payments.

134
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,850
Of that $100 million in
payments, 6% on the $400

135
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,770
million, that's $24 million
in payments.

136
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,550
Right?

137
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,950
So $24 million in payments will
go to the senior tranche.

138
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,150
Similarly we issued 300,000
shares at $1000 per share on

139
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,200
the mezzanine tranche.

140
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,060
This is also 1000.

141
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,030
This is the mezzanine tranche.

142
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,660
And let's say they get 7%,
a slightly higher return.

143
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,320
And these percentages are
usually determined by some

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,100
type of market or what people
are willing to get.

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,700
But let's just say it's
fixed for now.

146
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,350
Let's say it's 7%.

147
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,950
So 300,000 shares, seven 7%.

148
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,290
These guys are going
to get $21 million.

149
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,170
Right?

150
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,080
So out of the $100 million every
year, $24 million is

151
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,570
going to go to these guys, $21
million is going to go to

152
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,370
these guys, and then whatever's
left over is going

153
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,110
to go to the equity tranche.

154
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,960
So the $300 million from equity,
they're going to get

155
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,820
$55 million assuming that
there are no defaults or

156
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,400
pre-payments or anything shady
happens with the securities.

157
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,860
But these guys are going
to get $55 million.

158
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,090
Or on $300 million, that's
a 16.5% return.

159
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,170
And I know what you're
thinking.

160
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,880
Boy, Sal, that sounds amazing.

161
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,280
Why wouldn't everyone want
to be an equity investor?

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,590
I don't know.

163
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,170
My pen has stopped working.

164
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,900
But anyway, I'll try to move
on without my pen.

165
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,890
So you're saying, why wouldn't
everyone want to

166
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,570
be an equity investor?

167
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,400
Well, let me ask
you a question.

168
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,850
What happens if -- let's go to
that scenario where we talked

169
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,020
before -- 20% of the borrowers
just say, you know what?

170
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,780
I can't pay this mortgage
anymore.

171
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,326
I'm going to hand you back
the keys to these houses.

172
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:27,760
And of that 20%, you only
get a 50% return.

173
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,550
So for each of those $1 million
houses, you're only

174
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,060
able to sell it for $500,000.

175
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,240
So then instead of getting $100
million per year, you're

176
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,080
only going to get $90
million per year.

177
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,340
I wish I could use my pen.

178
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,540
Something about my computer
has frozen.

179
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,960
So instead of $100 million a
year, you're now only going to

180
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,980
get $90 million a year.

181
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,530
Right?

182
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,480
And all of a sudden,
these guys are not

183
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,460
going to be cut off.

184
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,230
This guy is still going to get
$24 million, this guy is still

185
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,320
going to get $21 million, but
now this guy is going to get

186
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,070
$45 million.

187
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,675
But he's still getting
above average yield.

188
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:05,830
Now let's say it gets
even worse.

189
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,430
Let's say a bunch of
borrowers start

190
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,720
defaulting on their loans.

191
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,010
And instead of getting $90
million per year, you start

192
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,880
only getting $50 million
in per year.

193
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,940
Now you pay this guy
$24 million.

194
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,570
You pay this guy $21 million
-- or this group of guys or

195
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,970
gals -- $21 million.

196
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,510
And then all you have left is
$5 million for this guy.

197
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,260
And $5 million on $300 million,
now he's getting less

198
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,840
than a 2% return.

199
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,419
So this guy took on higher
risk for higher reward.

200
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,900
If everyone pays, sure,
he gets 16.5%.

201
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,820
But then if you start having a
lot of defaults, if, let's

202
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,090
say, the return on what you get
every month goes in half,

203
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,470
this guy takes the entire hit.

204
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,130
So his return goes to 0%.

205
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,030
So he had higher risk,
higher reward, while

206
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,450
these guys get untouched.

207
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,130
Of course, if enough people
start defaulting, even these

208
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,440
people start to get hurt.

209
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,250
So this is a form of a
collateralized debt

210
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,000
obligation.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,870
This is actually a
mortgage-backed collateralized

212
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,560
debt obligation.

213
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,100
You can actually do this type
of a structure with any type

214
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,580
of debt obligation that's
backed by assets.

215
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,260
So we did the situation with
mortgages, but you could do it

216
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,110
with a bunch of assets.

217
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,250
You could do it with
corporate debt.

218
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,450
You could do it with receivables
from a company.

219
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,880
But what you read about the
most right now in the

220
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,910
newspapers is mortgage-backed
collateralized debt

221
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,490
obligations.

222
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,820
And to some degree, that's
what's been getting a lot of

223
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,890
these hedge funds in trouble.

224
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,230
And I think I'll do another
presentation on exactly how

225
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,370
and why they have gotten
in trouble.

226
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,760
Look forward to talking to you
