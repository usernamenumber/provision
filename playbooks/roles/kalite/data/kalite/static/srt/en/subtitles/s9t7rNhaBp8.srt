Welcome to the presentation on the Pythagorean theorem

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I apologize if my a little horsey, I was uh, (a little hoarse not horsey)

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I was signing a little bit too much last night

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, please forgive me, well anyway we will now teach you about the

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Pythagorean theorem and you might have heard of this before

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as far as I know i is the only mathematical theorem named after

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the founder of a religion actually Pythagoras actually

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think his whole religion was based on mathematics but

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm no historian here so I will leave that to the historians

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But anyway let's get started on what the Pythagorean theorem

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is all about
