1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,389
so this is the first video in a short
series introducing some of the major

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,580
ideas of the protestant reformation
And in this video we just want to lay

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,790
the groundwork

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,390
what was it like to live in europe
before the protestant reformation

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,590
That is before fifteen seventeen when
martin luther a german monk and

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,250
professor of theology nailed his
ninety-five theses

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,300
to the door of the catholic church in
Wittenberg

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,740
and we'll get back to that

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,729
I was driving around my neighborhood
about a week ago

10
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,329
and I took photographs of some of the
churches that were there and within only

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,210
fifteen or twenty minutes I had
photographed the signs in front of six

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,839
different kinds of churches and this is
a really good place to start because

13
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,320
it's at the time of reformation that
we get this explosion

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,520
of different kinds of christianity so tell
us what you took pictures of. I took

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,110
pictures of a lutheran church of the baptist
church of the united methodist church

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,500
there was a catholic church there there
was a congregational church

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,150
there's a presbyterian church

18
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,170
and so

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,560
five of those six churches were created
as a result of the protestant

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,729
reformation so let's go back to a time
when it was only one kind of

21
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,619
christianity in western europe

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,409
and that's religion we today call
roman catholicism no we didn't need to

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:24,520
use that phrase roman catholicism
because there was nothing to

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,450
differentiate it from

25
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,520
the term catholic really means universal
and so that makes the point

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,780
that this was the universal church or
that was their ambition to be

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,070
the universal church and we use the
term roman catholic

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,510
because the head of the church is
in Rome and that's the pope

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,630
That man was enormously important

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,730
because he would lead the way to salvation and to heaven

31
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,490
according to the catholic tradition that
is one found one's way to salvation

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,360
which was tremendously important because
the alternative was hell and it's important

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,610
to remember I think that back then the
concern for most people was salvation

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,060
was how to get to heaven

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,359
and the path was one path

36
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,239
It was through the teachings of the church

37
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,930
through the sacraments

38
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,689
In a way it was a simpler time to live because
you get one choice you don't have to say

39
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,340
what religion should I be except for
those very few people

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,820
in Europe, for instance,

41
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,930
very few jews and even if you are
Muslims. So the church really infused

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,490
everybody's life it was the vehicle
to salvation and just for the average

43
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,400
person

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,620
in a small town

45
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:37,000
the church's would tower over the
other buildings. The bells in the tower would

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,719
ring on the hour.

47
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,129
The church would celebrate the saint's feast days what
we call holidays

48
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,779
that is holy days

49
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:48,760
and it was in a sense the church that
marked the days of your life and the

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,870
major events in your life as well and
through the sacraments you helped to

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,879
earn God's grace you have to secure
yourself a place in heaven and the

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,870
sacraments included baptism,

53
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,959
confirmation, communion, which you might know as the
Eucharist

54
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,039
penance, also known as confession,

55
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,569
marriage,

56
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,999
last rites,

57
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,759
and ordination for priests.

58
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,630
so it's good reminder of how
important the church was

59
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,230
in the lives of every day people and
those everyday people although they

60
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,209
might look to their local priest would
look to the pope in rome

61
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,079
as the ultimate authority on earth

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,859
and the pope at this point in fifteen
seventeen was Pope Leo X (the tenth)

63
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,579
so Pope Leo X (the tenth) was intent on
rebuilding the church of Saint Peter's

64
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,790
and the plans

65
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,380
for Saint Peter's were very
ambitious. In fact, Pope Julius II

66
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,149
who commissioned the rebuilding of Saint
Peter's (the pope before Pope Leo X)

67
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:53,680
said he wanted to create the most
grandiose church in all of christendom

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,849
and they did

69
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:59,209
the church itself Saint Peter's Basilica
was tremendously important to the authority

70
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,269
of the pope

71
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,400
by tradition Saint Peter is buried under

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,469
that church and Saint Peter was charged by
Christ himself to lead the church

73
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:10,739
so Saint Peter is understood

74
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,269
to be the first pope

75
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,150
and so every succeeding pope

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,010
is taking on the job of Saint Peter from
Christ himself

77
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,940
and so the very authority

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,949
of this office is vested in this
building. The problem is

79
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,050
the building was really expensive to
construct and the question was where

80
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,739
were they going to get the money. 
Well there was a pretty common way to get

81
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,570
money and that was

82
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,410
selling indulgences.

83
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,070
Now an indulgence was a piece of paperwork that
made it possible

84
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,620
for you to get to Heaven more quickly.

85
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,970
most people when they died

86
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,720
you had throughout your life confessed
your sins you had atoned for your

87
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,450
sins but

88
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,259
it would probably be something

89
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,820
that you hadn't quite atoned for

90
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,190
and so for most people you wouldn't go
straight to Heaven

91
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,600
you would go instead to this place in the
betveen the way station before you get to

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,060
Heaven

93
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,860
a place called

94
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,900
purgatory

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,960
and it was indulgences that bought you time
off from purgatory. So this is a little

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,639
tricky because indulgences were actually a
very old tradition

97
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,669
where if you did a good work

98
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,630
you could, in fact, receive an indulgence
that is a kind of certificate that would

99
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,819
speed your soul out of purgatory to
Heaven. Even in certain extraordinary

100
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:25,639
cases

101
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,030
it might allow you to circumvent
purgatory entirely and go directly to

102
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,930
Heaven.

103
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,560
The problems began

104
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,070
not so much in the actual indulgences

105
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,620
but in the perception of the selling of
indulgences and here's what happened.

106
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,639
Leo X

107
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,470
granted indulgences to his
representatives to raise money for the

108
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,569
building of Saint Peter's. But this was
misunderstood to mean

109
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:54,380
that one could simply pay money and then
gain access to heaven directly.

110
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,520
But keep in mind that money was for the
rebuilding of...

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,660
Saint Peter's

112
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,290
and so you were doing a good work and
according to the catholic church doing

113
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,889
a good work is one of the ways you can

114
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,009
assist in the process of gaining
yourself a place in heaven.

115
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,879
And it does make sense that even a
monetary donation to doing good

116
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,950
christian work

117
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,910
would be itself a kind of holy act.
But it did come to be seen as a money

118
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,129
exchange

119
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:23,139
for getting to Heaven.

120
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,959
And the one example that really got
under Martin Luther's cross, so to speak,

121
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,050
was a man named Tetzel who was selling
indulgences not far

122
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,969
from Wittenberg where Luther was Professor of
Theology. Tetzel said,

123
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,710
"as soon as the coin in the coffer rings,

124
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,490
the soul from purgatory springs."

125
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,150
So you can see right there

126
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,629
money is going in and the soul is going
up to Heaven. It sounds so crass and

127
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,979
you're absolutely right

128
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:57,399
Martin Luther who was a monk and was
a very devout professor of theology was

129
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,009
really rubbed the wrong way by

130
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,539
people saying they had bought these
indulgences and therefore they were

131
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:09,449
freed of their sins. 
And as a monk, Luther felt oppressed by the sinfulness

132
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,169
of human nature of his own
nature

133
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,649
and so the idea that you can pay money

134
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,419
to erase those sins and get quicker entry to Heaven
was really an issue for

135
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:18,819
him

136
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,270
he took these issues very seriously and
really struggled with them

137
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,389
and then he did

138
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,660
what any good

139
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,810
doctor of theology would do. He wrote out
a series of arguments. But in his case

140
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,629
he posted them at least according to
tradition

141
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,729
to the doors of the castle church in
wittenberg

142
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,040
ninety-five theses ninety-five arguments

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,130
that took issue primarily

144
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,090
with the selling of indulgences

145
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,669
Luther sent them to the local archbishop
and they made their way around

146
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,270
and so we have the beginnings of the
protestant reformation

147
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,770
in fact if you think about those words
protestant reformation for just a moment

148
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,340
i think it's interesting to note that
the word protestant is formed out of the word

149
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,860
protest and reformation out of the word
reform

150
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,760
so this was a kind of protest against
the church

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,100
and it was an attempt to reform it
