1
00:00:06,288 --> 00:00:09,200
We're in The Hofburg in Vienna in the royal treasury

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,604
which is filled with crowns and scepters

3
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:15,721
Reliquaries and jewells. It's amazing.

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:19,003
and one of the real treasures is an enormous mantle

5
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,604
that was worn during the coronations of the holy Roman emperors

6
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:25,099
But that's not what this was made for.

7
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,225
This was made in the 12th century in Sicily,

8
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,858
actually in the royal workshops of Roger II

9
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:33,455
who was a Norman that ruled

10
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:36,985
and the Normans you might remember actually began as Vikings

11
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,519
as they came down from the North

12
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,097
and they eventually settled in north-western France.

13
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:44,400
and also at the bottom of Italy and the island of Sicily

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,274
and that's where this was made.

15
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:49,118
So this is a really large cloak

16
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:53,554
you can see the hasps at the top for where it was worn on the shoulders

17
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:57,401
and its made of red silk, gold stitchings

18
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:02,067
and thousands of pearls and enamel plates and jewells

19
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,691
And it's in exceptional condition.

20
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,357
The enamel is made in cloth edge where very fine walls of gold

21
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:11,707
separate the enamels' themselves as they melt, as they petrify

22
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:13,760
and what's interesting about this mantle is

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,753
if you look at its imagery

24
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,199
even that was made for Christian ruler

25
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:22,958
It's full of Islamic motives,it was made by Islamic artisans

26
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:27,205
and we see that in the lion overpowering a camel,

27
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:31,593
we see it in the caligraphic script along the semicircular bottom

28
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,930
and the tree of life in the centre

29
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,340
and motif almost identical to that in the dome of the rock in Jerusalem

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,941
These are motives that come out of the patternbooks that

31
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,693
would have transversed the Islamic world

32
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:44,501
and recopied over hundreds of years

33
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,908
the robe is clearly meant to symbolize power

34
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,859
Look at the forms of those lions.

35
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,858
They're schematic and not terribly naturalistic

36
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:56,340
but they evoke a real sense of fierceness in their faces,

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,812
and their puffed up chests.

38
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:01,994
And the camels look so subdued and overpowered.

39
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,663
Those camels are domesticated.

40
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:05,259
They're actually wearing saddles.

41
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:08,193
One of the interpretations of this iconography, of this symbolism

42
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:11,441
is that the lions were actually representing the Normans.

43
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:15,323
The house of Roger II had as its symbol the lion.

44
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:18,468
wheras the camel might be a reference to people

45
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,525
that Roger had conquered.

46
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:23,440
so although this cloth was made in the 12th century

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,395
it acquired the legend that it was made for Charlemagne,

48
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:30,724
for the very first holy Roman emperor for the 9th century

49
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,258
But we know that it's not the case.

50
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:35,613
because in fact the Kufic inscription of Arabic writing

51
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,541
gives us a specific tape.

52
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,202
This mantle was worked in the most magnificent royal splendor

53
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,840
perfection, might, superiority

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,994
approval, prosperity, magnanimity, beauty

55
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,777
the fullfilment of all desires and hopes

56
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:54,174
felicitous days and nights without cease or change,

57
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,825
with authority, with honour, freedom from harm,

58
00:02:57,825 --> 00:03:02,775
triumph and livelihood in the city of Sicily in the year 528

59
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,325
528 according to the Islamic calendar

60
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,304
dating from the time of Mohamed

61
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:10,808
this correlated with the 12th century in the western calendar

62
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:14,740
those plates also have a kind of important iconography that has an Islamic origin.

63
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,225
you'll see the star that's made of intersection of two squares

64
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:20,216
and going back to the begining of Islam

65
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:23,561
there was a notion that the Earth was a square

66
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,080
and the heavens were square

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,456
here we see those overweight

68
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,342
and so you do have a kind of cosmological reference

69
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,093
and perhaps a reference that Roger himself

70
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:33,455
ruled over all

71
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,844
There is a clear sense here of

72
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:38,574
speaking to the owners grandeur

73
00:03:38,574 --> 00:03:43,694
Just imagine, through history those that were crowned holy Roman emperor

74
00:03:43,694 --> 00:03:48,905
wearing this garment, carrying an orb, carrying a sceptre.

75
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:52,926
The Pope, a huge ensemble of the most powerful people in the West.

76
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:56,926
It must have been quite a sight to see.
