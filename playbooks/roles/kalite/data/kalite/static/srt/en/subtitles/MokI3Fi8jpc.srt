1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,430
Show 109% by shading.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,760
So just as a bit of review, 109%
if we were to write it

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,910
out, would literally be 109
percent, which is the same

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:25,330
thing as 109 per-- and I could
write cent again, but that's

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,270
getting old.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,540
Cent means 100, so it literally

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,850
means 109 per hundred.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,400
If you had 100 per 100, you're
dealing with the whole, but

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,040
now we have more than a whole.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,850
We have 109 per 100.

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,460
We can actually write this as
a ratio, or as a fraction.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,730
This is the same thing
as 109 per 100.

14
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,220
It's the the same thing
as 109/100.

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,260
So let's shade that in.

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,720
So we have a whole here,
so we could consider

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,300
this square a whole.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,150
In the last video, we counted.

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,830
This is a 10 by 10 square.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,460
It is cut up into 100 pieces.

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,510
So if we want 109 of those
100 pieces, what

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,660
are we talking about?

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,130
That means we're going to
shade in all of the

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,350
100 right over here.

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,950
Let me do that in a new color.

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,090
So we'll shade in all of this.

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,550
   

28
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,740
If you just shaded that in,
that would be 100%.

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:28,410
That would be 100/100, or
100 per 100, or 100%.

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,540
I think you're getting the
meaning of all of this.

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,940
I don't just want you just
memorize this stuff.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,970
This really just means 100
out of 100, or a whole.

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,540
And you can see that this
is the whole square.

34
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,010
That's 100 out of
100 right there.

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,200
The question is saying show
us 109% by shading.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,610
We already did 100 per 100, but
we need to do another 9,

37
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,170
so let's shade in another 9.

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:55,380
So now we have one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

39
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,030
eight, nine.

40
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,350
So this piece right here, you
could almost view that is--

41
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,090
well, that is!

42
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,320
That is 9% of an
entire square.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,700
This is 100% of an
entire square.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,620
If you considered this whole
thing plus this blue area

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,920
right over here, you are talking
about 109% of one

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,690
whole square.

47
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,430
Hopefully, that made sense.

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,867
