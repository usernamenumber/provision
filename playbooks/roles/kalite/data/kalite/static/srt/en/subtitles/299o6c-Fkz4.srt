1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,070
Let's have 1 molar of-- let
me pick a strong acid.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,730
Let's say it's hydrochloric
acid.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,580
HCl.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,810
And we know, of course, that
since it's a strong acid it

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,309
disassociates completely.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,370
So HCl in an aqueous solution--
or a solution of

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,700
water-- disassociates completely
into hydrogen ions

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,660
in an aqueous solution, which
is really hydronium.

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,390
I've said that multiple times.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,670
Plus your chlorine anion
in an aqueous solution.

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,300
So if you actually have a molar
of this, as soon as you

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,580
put it in the water, you really
have 1 molar of this.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,120
So your hydrogen concentration
is really 1 molar.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,960
And of course we know, what's
the pH of that?

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,170
Well, the pH is just the minus
log base 10 of your hydrogen

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,270
concentration, which is 1.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,760
Which is the minus log of 0.

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,610
So minus 0, which
is equal to 0.

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,209
So your pH is going
to be equal to 0.

20
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,560
And let's say for use in the
later part of this, let's say

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,940
I have a liter of this.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,110
Right.

23
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,290
This just tells me how many
moles per liter, and now I

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,680
just told you that
I have 1 liter.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,210
So you know that you
have 1 mole.

26
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,810
Let me make a little
chart here.

27
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,650
I'll make a little box here.

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,100
And let's make this
axis right here.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,050
This is going to be my pH.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,800
And right when I take that first
measurement-- let's say

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,700
this is 0 here, this is 7,
and this is 14 up here.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,660
When I take that first
measurement, my solution of

33
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,270
hydrogen chloride, or
hydrochloric acid, has a pH 0.

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,170
Now, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to titrate this

35
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,530
aqueous solution of acid.

36
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,240
And titrate just means drop
something else into it in

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,650
controlled increments
to see what happens.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,121
And what I'm doing here
is going to be

39
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:07,800
an acid-base titration.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,199
I have an acid here, and what
I'm actually going to titrate

41
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:16,110
it with, or the reagent that
I'm going to add to it--

42
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,540
The reagent is essentially a
reactant that, when you view

43
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,400
it this way, that you're
adding to the solution.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
So it's the titrant.

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,600
So in this case, my solution
already has

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,825
hydrochloric acid in it.

47
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,360
The pH is already 0.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,480
But what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,880
add a strong base.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,410
Let's say sodium hydroxide.

51
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,740
That's my favorite
strong base.

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,500
And let's say I have a solution
that I have prepared

53
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,230
ahead of time.

54
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,595
Let's say it's a 1
molar solution.

55
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,330
But I'm not going to add all
of it at the same time.

56
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm going to add it
in increments of

57
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,300
a tenth of a liter.

58
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:02,020
So this is 1 liter
that I've added.

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,150
And then this would
be 2 liters.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,440
And so this would be
500 milliliters.

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,240
500 mL.

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,720
This is 1 liter.

63
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
This is 1.5 liters.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,130
This 2 liters.

65
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,740
And so on this axis, I'm going
to slowly add more and more of

66
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,420
this hydroxide.

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,670
So what's going to happen?

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,610
As I slowly add hydroxide, it's
going to increase the pH.

69
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,750
Why is it going to
increase the pH?

70
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,950
Because this OH.

71
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,130
Remember, hydroxide
is a strong base.

72
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,750
So the NaOH disassociates
completely

73
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,440
in an aqueous solution.

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,820
To OH minus plus
sodium cation.

75
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,370
Right?

76
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,900
Now if I'm adding this to this
stuff here, what do you

77
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,650
think's going to happen?

78
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,840
Well this stuff right here,
these OHs are just going to

79
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,960
sop up your hydrogens.

80
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,430
So for the most part--
obviously, everything is

81
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:04,950
probabalistic.

82
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,380
And whenever we're dealing with
chemistry, there's always

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,715
some molecules that won't
completely react, and there

84
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,230
will always be some
concentration of anything.

85
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,000
And that's why you actually
can never get to a 0

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,990
concentration of hydrogen, no
matter how much base you add.

87
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,570
Because there will always be
some hydrogen molecules that

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,365
are just hiding just perfectly,
or they're in

89
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,870
perfect equilibrium so
they don't react.

90
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,720
But most of them will react.

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,110
But as I add more H, these
are going to disappear.

92
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,450
So my hydrogen concentration
is going to go down.

93
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,360
The pH is a negative log of
that, so your pH will go up.

94
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,950
Your pH will go up slowly--
well, it will look slowly,

95
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,050
because it's a log chart,
so maybe it's doing

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,610
something like this.

97
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,230
Your pH concentration is going
to look something like-- as

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,060
you add more and more.

99
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,930
But you might say, oh that's
such a slow movement.

100
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,250
Why isn't it occurring faster.

101
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,560
But you have to think
about something.

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,940
This right here, if this is a pH
of 1, this means-- so, at a

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,810
pH of 0, this means
your hydrogen

104
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,410
concentration is 1 molar.

105
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,130
At a pH of 1, this means your
hydrogen concentration is at

106
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,640
10 to the minus 1.

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,480
Which is 0.1 molar.

108
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,410
So even though on a log chart
it looks like you've made a

109
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,190
very small movement, you've
actually gone

110
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,640
by a factor of 10.

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,205
In terms of your reduction of
your hydrogen concentration.

112
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,360
You started off with 1 molar
of your hydrogen.

113
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,910
By the time you've added roughly
900 milliliters of

114
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,530
your solution, you probably
would have gotten

115
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,220
rid of most of it.

116
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,580
And obviously the denomenator's
changing,

117
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,270
because I'm actually
adding volume here.

118
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,600
Right?

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,220
Because I'm actually adding
some volume here.

120
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,120
So you would have to add them.

121
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,850
But you get the I
general idea.

122
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,380
That these actual molecules of
hydroxide are going to react

123
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,420
with these things.

124
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,370
They're going to essentially
turn into water and disappear

125
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,340
into the solution.

126
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,430
So these are going to
disappear with those

127
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,010
disappearing, for
the most part.

128
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,120
Which leads in an overall
reduction concentration of

129
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,080
your hydrogen ions, which
will lead to an

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,500
increase in your pH.

131
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,590
Until some point where you have
pretty much sopped up as

132
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,540
many of these things
as you can.

133
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,520
There will always be a few of
them, but you've sopped up as

134
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,780
many of them as you can.

135
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,310
And so any incremental hydroxide
you add will

136
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,950
actually go to build the
hydroxide concentration.

137
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,140
Where the hydroxide
concentration is going to be

138
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,690
greater than your hydrogen
concentration.

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,480
But even better than that,
there's going to be some point

140
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,780
where you've added just enough
of this that you have an equal

141
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,030
amount of this and this.

142
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,410
You have an equal amount of
hydroxide and hydrogen.

143
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,200
Right?

144
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,370
What happens, first of all, when
there's an equal amount

145
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,380
of hydroxide and hydrogen?

146
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,240
Well, then you're neutral.

147
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,320
Right?

148
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,390
If your hydroxide concentration
is equal to your

149
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,280
hydrogen concentration,
you're neutral.

150
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,320
This is just like water.

151
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,810
You're at a pH of 7.

152
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,010
So there's some point where your
hydroxide concentration

153
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,270
is equal to your hydrogen
concentration, and your pH is

154
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,730
going to be 7.

155
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,680
And then above that,
you're just adding

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,990
more and more hydroxide.

157
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,690
The hydroxide concentration is
overwhelming your hydrogen

158
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,630
concentration.

159
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,580
And so you're going to get
really, really basic.

160
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,040
And since this is a strong base,
you're eventually going

161
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,340
to get to a pH of 14.

162
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,490
Because you're essentially going
to have-- well, you're

163
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,400
not going to have 1 molar.

164
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,760
Let me erase that point.

165
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,320
You're going to have
half a molar of OHs

166
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,240
at the end of this.

167
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,830
So your graph is going to look
something like this.

168
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,850
Now, I mean, you're still
going to have hydrogen

169
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,070
concentration, but it's going
to go really small.

170
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,450
It's going to get really,
really small.

171
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,030
Now.

172
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,330
What's interesting about what
just happened here?

173
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,570
At this point right here, your
OH is equal to your hydrogen.

174
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,460
And the way I think about it is
the great majority of your

175
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,210
moles of hydrogen were sopped
up at that point.

176
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,980
So in order to stop up 1 mole of
hydrogen, you essentially,

177
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,880
for the most part-- and there's
always things that

178
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,740
don't get completely sopped up--
but you'll essentially

179
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,919
have to add 1 mole
of OH to sop up

180
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,280
your 1 mole of hydrogen.

181
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,289
Remember, this is 1 molar and
you had 1 liter of it.

182
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,650
So you had 1 mole of
hydrogen to sop up.

183
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,700
So you need 1 mole of OH to sop
up, and how do you get 1

184
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,040
mole of OH?

185
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,130
Well, we said the concentration
of the solution

186
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,110
was 1 molar.

187
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,170
So once you put a liter in
there-- because that's 1 mole

188
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,240
per liter-- once you put a liter
in there, you would have

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,430
put 1 mole of hydroxide
cations in there

190
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,390
to sop up the hydrogen.

191
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,240
So this is the equivalence
point.

192
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,180
Where have essentially, you have
an equal amount and very

193
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,430
low concentrations of both
hydroxide and hydrogen.

194
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,370
You've essentially sopped up all
of the hydrogen, but you

195
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,880
also have sopped up all
of the hydroxide that

196
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,170
you've added so far.

197
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,660
After this point, any hydroxide
you add will

198
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,520
essentially contribute to
increasing the pH even more.

199
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,560
Or it'll kind of overwhelm your
hydrogen concentration.

200
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,760
Now what's interesting
about this?

201
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,510
In this example, I told you, oh,
I have hydrochloric acid

202
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,870
and I gave you its concentration
ahead of time.

203
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,070
But let's say I didn't
tell you that.

204
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,730
Let's say it was some mystery
substance, and you just

205
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,000
measured the mystery
substance's pH.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,970
At this point, you said
OK, it's pH is 0.

207
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,560
And you titrated it with
this sodium hydroxide.

208
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,250
And you said, well, gee, when
I added 1 mole-- because you

209
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,810
figured out at a liter of the
solution-- of hydroxide ions.

210
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,010
At that point, I've essentially
eliminated all of

211
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,990
the hydrogen ions that were
in my original solution.

212
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,300
So I must have had 1 mole
of whatever acid

213
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,890
this was over here.

214
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,620
So this would have told you that
my initial concentration

215
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:18,680
was 1 mole of H plus.

216
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,450
And since we know it's easy to
see how much volume you have,

217
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,180
you see I have a liter.

218
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,850
So you say my original
concentration of

219
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,730
this acid is 1 molar.

220
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,490
And you could also know that
what you're dealing with is a

221
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,740
strong acid.

222
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,460
And I encourage you to watch the
next to do I do the same

223
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,390
thing with a weak acid.

224
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,980
But because it's a strong acid
and a strong base reacting

225
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,810
with each other, when you have
the same number moles of both,

226
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,690
you get exactly to a pH of 7.

227
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,620
They completely neutralize each
other, and you have a

228
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,350
completely neutral solution.

229
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,510
If you had a strong base with a
weak acid, the strong base--

230
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,840
once you have the same amount as
the weak acid, it would've

231
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,770
neutralized it.

232
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,090
But you would have also
had some of the

233
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,370
conjugate weak base left.

234
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,950
So you would have actually
ended up with a basic pH.

235
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,060
And I'm going to do that
in the next video.

236
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,440
But if you see that the
equivalence point occurs at a

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,850
pH of 7, you'd know that you
were titrating-- what you were

238
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,150
dealing with was
a strong acid.

239
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,780
Because it was completely
neutralized, not more than

240
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,270
neutralized, by the
strong base.

241
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,560
And if you want to eye-ball
where is equivalence point,

242
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,150
you look for the steepest
point in the graph.

243
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,840
Because that's the point where
you're going from having a

244
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,090
majority of hydrogen versus
hydroxide, to having a

245
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,120
majority of hydroxide
versus hydrogen.

246
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,660
So it creates this inflection
in the graph, and you just

247
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,240
would have to look
at this chart.

248
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,210
And say, I added a liter
of this solution.

249
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,280
The concentration of this
solution is 1 mole per liter.

250
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,220
It's 1 molar.

251
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,840
It has a molarity of 1.

252
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,870
So I must have added
1 mole of hydroxide

253
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,820
to get to this point.

254
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,480
So I must have neutralized
1 mole hydrogen.

255
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,140
So there must have been 1 mole
of hydrogen to begin with.

256
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,330
And since I had 1 liter of
solution, I had 1 mole

257
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,100
hydrogen and 1 liter
of solution.

258
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,160
So my original molarity was 1.

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Anyway, I don't want to
confuse you too much.

260
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,340
In the next video, I'm going to
try to do the same thing,

261
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,880
but I'm going to do it
with a weak acid.
