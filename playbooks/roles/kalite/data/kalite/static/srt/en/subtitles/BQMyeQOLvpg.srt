1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,340
I think you've been exposed to
the idea of a function at some

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,500
point in your mathematical
career.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,840
But what I want to do in this
video is explain it a little

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,550
bit more formerly than you might
be used to, and then

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,420
relate it to some of the
concepts of vectors and linear

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,945
algebra that we've
seen so far.

8
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:19,585
   

9
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:23,340
A function really is just a
relation between the members

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,590
of one set and the members
of the other set.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:34,070
So let's have some set x, and
for every member of that set x

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,740
I'm going to relate that member,
or associate that

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,075
member, with another
member of a set y.

14
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,850
   

15
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:53,490
So if I imagine that is my set
x, and that this is my set y--

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,830
and y doesn't have to be
smaller, that's just the way I

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,110
drew it-- the function
is just a relation.

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,290
That if I just take a member of
my set x, let's see that's

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,640
the member that I'm
taking, we're

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
visualizing it as a point.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,420
This function will say, OK you
gave me a member of x, then I

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,930
will give you a member
of y associated with

23
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,660
that member of x.

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,470
So the function will say, you
give me that, then I will map

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,330
it to that member right there.

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,430
And that really just means
relating it to, or associating

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,200
with another member of y.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,780
And if you'd give me some other
point right here, I'll

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,000
relate it to another
member of y.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,170
   

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,240
I might even relate it to
the same member of y.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,220
And so this notation just says
this is a mapping from one set

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,940
x, and I'm speaking in
very general terms,

34
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,990
to another set y.

35
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,840
And so you're probably saying,
Hey Sal, this is very

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,260
abstract, how does this relate
to the functions that I've

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,320
seen in the past?

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,180
Well let me just write down a
function you've probably seen

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,520
a lot in the past. You've
dealt with f of x

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,330
is equal to x squared.

41
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,520
How would we write this
in this notation?

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,260
Well this is a function,
assuming that it's kind of the

43
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,940
traditional way that
you see it.

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,700
   

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,520
Let me just write with the f,
I was going to write it with

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,880
the g of x, just so this doesn't
always have to be an

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,320
f, but I think you
get that idea.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,400
In this case f is a mapping from
real numbers-- the real

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,810
numbers are everything that I
can put in here-- actually

50
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,720
this is part of the function
definition.

51
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,050
I could constrain this to just
be integers, or just be even

52
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,160
numbers, or just be
even integers.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,790
But this is part of the function
definition, I'm

54
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,000
defining the function to be a
mapping from real numbers.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,290
I'm saying you can put any real
number here, and it's

56
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:56,860
going to map to real numbers.

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,000
So in this case, if x is real
numbers, it's going to map to

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,230
itself, which is completely
legitimate.

59
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,420
So if this is the real numbers--
and obviously the

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,660
real numbers would go off in
every direction forever-- but

61
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,790
if this for real numbers, this
function mapping is just

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,800
taking every point in
R and mapping it to

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,690
another point in R.

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,580
It's taking every point and
associating with it its

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,780
perfect square.

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,240
And I want to make a very subtle
notation-- or at least

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,880
in my mind the first time that
I got exposed to functions I

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,680
was thinking, you give me an
x and I square it, and I'm

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,060
giving you the square of x.

70
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,550
And that's true, you
are doing that.

71
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,690
But at least the way my brain
worked, I kind of thought of

72
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,730
it as I was changing my
x into another number.

73
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,770
And you can maybe view it that
way, and that might actually

74
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,150
be the best way to view it.

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,400
But the mathematical definition
I'm introducing

76
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:55,190
here is more that I'm
associating x with x squared.

77
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,990
This is another function
notation of writing this exact

78
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,630
same thing.

79
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,010
These two statements right here,
this statement and this

80
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,530
statement are identical.

81
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,860
This statement you've probably
never seen before, but I like

82
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,160
it because it shows the mapping
or the association

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,660
more, while this association I
think that you're putting an x

84
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,660
into a little meat grinder or
some machine that's going to

85
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,480
ground up the x or square the x,
or do whatever it needs to

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,410
do to the x.

87
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,620
This notation to me implies
the actual mapping.

88
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,070
You give me an x, and I'm going
to associate another

89
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,860
number in real numbers
called x squared.

90
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,510
So it's going to be just
another point.

91
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,260
And just as a little bit of
terminology, and I think

92
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,910
you've seen this terminology
before, the set that you are

93
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,610
mapping from is called the
domain and it's part of the

94
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,660
function definition.

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,620
I, as the function creator, have
to tell you that every

96
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,010
valid input here has to be
a set of real numbers.

97
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:02,920
Now the set that I'm mapping
to is called the codomain.

98
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,620
   

99
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,810
The obvious question that you're
probably asking is, hey

100
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,660
Sal, when I learned all of this
function stuff in algebra

101
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,630
II or whenever you first learned
it, we never used this

102
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,880
codomain word.

103
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,770
   

104
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,100
We have this idea of range, I
learned the word range when I

105
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,840
was in 9th or 10th grade.

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,290
How does this codomain
relate to range?

107
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,610
And it's a very subtle
notation.

108
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,670
So the codomain is a set that
you're mapping to, and in this

109
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,035
example this is the codomain.

110
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:44,390
In this example, the real
numbers are the

111
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,480
domain and the codomain.

112
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080
So the question is how does
the range relate to this?

113
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,060
So the codomain is the
set that can be

114
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,640
possibly mapped to.

115
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,530
You're not necessarily
mapping to every

116
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,700
point in the codomain.

117
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm just saying that this
function is generally mapping

118
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,150
from members of this
set to that set.

119
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,920
The range is the subset --
let me write it this way.

120
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
It could be equal
to the codomain.

121
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,210
It's some subset.

122
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,440
A set is a subset of itself,
every member of a set is also

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,320
a member of itself, so it's
a subset of itself.

124
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:29,830
So range is a subset of the
codomain which the function

125
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,150
actually maps to.

126
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:43,585
   

127
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:45,350
So let me give you an example.

128
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:52,380
Let's say I define the function
g, and it is a

129
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,890
mapping from the set
of real numbers.

130
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:03,450
Let me say it's a mapping
from R2 to R.

131
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,270
So I'm essentially taking
2-tuples and I'm

132
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,360
mapping it to R.

133
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,650
And I will define g, I'll
write it a couple

134
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,670
of different ways.

135
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:19,170
So now I'm going to take g of
two values, I could say xy or

136
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,380
I could say x1, x2.

137
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,580
Let me do it that way.

138
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:32,870
g of x1, x2 is always
equal to 2.

139
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,680
It's a mapping from R2 to R,
but this always equals 2.

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,050
And let me actually write the
other notation just because

141
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,365
you probably haven't
seen this much.

142
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:46,450
   

143
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:53,630
g maps any points x1 and
x2 to the point 2.

144
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,670
This makes the mapping
a little bit clearer.

145
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,183
But just to get the notation
right, what is our domain?

146
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:02,560
   

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
What's the real number?

148
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,760
That was part of my function
definition, I said we're

149
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,980
mapping from R2, so
my domain is R2.

150
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,310
   

151
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,760
Now what is my codomain?

152
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,110
   

153
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,230
My codomain is the set that I'm
potentially mapping to,

154
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,480
and is part of the function
definition.

155
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,750
This by definition
is the codomain.

156
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,030
So my codomain is R.

157
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,190
Now what is the range
of my function?

158
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,390
   

159
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,159
The range is the set of values
that the function

160
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,770
actually maps to.

161
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,710
In this case, we always map to
the value 2, so the range is

162
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,480
actually just the value 2.

163
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,650
And if we were to visualize
this-- R2 is actually-- I

164
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,300
wouldn't draw it as a blurb, I
would draw it as the entire

165
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,130
Cartesian space, but I'm just
giving you an abstract notion.

166
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:57,950
That's R2.

167
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,270
If I really have to draw R, I'd
draw it as some type of a

168
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,840
number line.

169
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,740
Actually let me do it that way
just for fun, you don't

170
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,260
normally see it written
that way.

171
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,220
But I could just draw R like
that's R2, and I could just

172
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,620
draw R as some straight line.

173
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,350
So this is the set R.

174
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,150
I could draw it like that
as well, but let's just

175
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,270
say this is set R.

176
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,780
And my function g essentially
maps any point over here to

177
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,080
exactly the point 2.

178
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,050
2 is just one little
point in R.

179
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:36,200
My function g takes any point in
R2, any coordinate, this is

180
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,630
the point 3, minus 5,
whatever it is.

181
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,080
It always maps it to
the point 2 in R.

182
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,830
So if I think that point it
maps it to the point 2.

183
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,720
That's what g always does.

184
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,980
So g's codomain-- you could
say it's all of the real

185
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,205
numbers, but it's range
is really just 2.

186
00:09:55,205 --> 00:10:00,040
   

187
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,690
Let me do another example that
might be interesting.

188
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:12,920
If I just write h is a function
that goes from R2 to

189
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,610
R3, and I'll be a little
careful here, h

190
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,480
goes from R2 to R3.

191
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:30,385
And I'll write here that h of
x1, x2 is equal to -- so now

192
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm mapping a higher dimension
space, so I'm going to say

193
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,070
that that is going to be equal
to, let's say my first

194
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,400
coordinate or my first component
at R3 is x1 plus x2.

195
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,440
Let's say my second coordinate
is x2 minus x1.

196
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,550
And let's say my third
coordinate is x2 times x1.

197
00:10:52,550 --> 00:11:00,150
Now what is my domain and my
range and my codomain?

198
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,140
So my domain by definition
is this right there.

199
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,230
My codomain by definition
is R3.

200
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,870
And notice I'm going from a
space that has two dimensions

201
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,080
to a space it has three
dimensions, or three

202
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,590
components.

203
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,070
But I can always associate some
point with x1, x2 with

204
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,840
some point in my R3 there.

205
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,840
A slightly trickier question
here is, what is the range?

206
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,410
Can I always associate every
point-- maybe this wasn't the

207
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,940
best example because it's not
simple enough -- but can I

208
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:42,190
associate every point in R3--
so this is my codomain, my

209
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,870
domain was R2, and my function
goes from R2 to

210
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,690
R3, so that's h.

211
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,410
And so my range, as you could
see, it's not like every

212
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,710
coordinate you can express
in this way in some way.

213
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,960
Let me give you an example.

214
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,510
   

215
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:07,110
I could put some x1's and x2's
here and figure it out.

216
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,660
Let's do that.

217
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:15,120
Let's take our h of-- let me use
my other notation-- let's

218
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,070
say that I said h, and I wanted
to find the mapping

219
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:25,130
from the point in R2, let's
say the point 2 comma 3.

220
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,780
And then my function tells me
that this will map to the

221
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,880
point in R3.

222
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,450
I add the two terms, the
2 plus 3, so it's 5.

223
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,100
I'd find the difference between
x2 and x1-- so 3 minus

224
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,150
2 is 1-- and then I multiply
the two, 6.

225
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,370
So clearly this will be in
the range, this is a

226
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,250
member of the range.

227
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:54,350
   

228
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,330
So for example the point 2, 3,
which might be right there,

229
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,180
will be mapped to the three
dimensional point, it's kind

230
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,520
of just drawn as a two
dimensional blurb right there,

231
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,050
but I think you get the idea,
would be mapped to the three

232
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,670
dimensional point 5, 1, 6.

233
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,860
So this is definitely a
member of the range.

234
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:22,260
Now my question to you, if I
have some point in R3, let's

235
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:33,050
say that this is the
point 5, 1, 0.

236
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,200
Is this point a member
of the range?

237
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,790
It's definitely a member of
the codomain, it's in R3.

238
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,110
It's definitely in
here, and this by

239
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,900
definition is the codomain.

240
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,910
But is this in our range?

241
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,770
   

242
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,570
5 has to be the sum of two
numbers, the 1 has to be the

243
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,270
difference of two numbers, and
then the 0 would have to be

244
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,350
the product of two numbers.

245
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,790
And clearly we know 5 is the
sum, and 1 is the difference,

246
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,240
we're dealing with 2 and 3, and
there's no way you can get

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,750
the product of those numbers
to be equal to 0.

248
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,520
So this guy is not
in the range.

249
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,210
So the range would be the subset
of all of these points

250
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,660
in R3, so there'd be a ton of
points that aren't in the

251
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,250
range, and there'll be a smaller
subset of R3 that is

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,140
in the range.

253
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,970
Now I want to introduce you to
one more piece of terminology

254
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,870
when it comes to functions.

255
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,760
These functions up here, this
function that mapped from

256
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,690
points in R2 to R, so
its codomain was R.

257
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,390
This function up here is
probably the most common

258
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,940
function you see in mathematics,
this is also

259
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,980
mapping to R.

260
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,560
These functions that map to R
are called scalar value or

261
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,300
real value, depending on how
you want to think about it.

262
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,230
But if they map to a one
dimensional space, we call

263
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,290
them a scalar valued function,
or a real valued function.

264
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:01,990
   

265
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,000
Which is pretty much all of
the functions that you've

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,270
probably dealt with up to this
point in your mathematical

267
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,750
career, unless you've taken
some vector calculus.

268
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:19,940
Now the functions that map to
spaces or subspaces that have

269
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,440
more than one dimension-- so if
you map to R or any subset

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,850
of R, you have a real valued
function, or a

271
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,190
scalar valued function.

272
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,480
If you map to Rn, where n is
greater than 1, so if you map

273
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,670
to R2, R3, R4, R100, you're
then dealing with a vector

274
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,620
valued function.

275
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,340
So this last function that I
defined over here, h is a

276
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:50,270
vector valued function.

277
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,260
Anyway I think you now have
at least the mathematical

278
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,870
notational tools to understand
what I'm going to do in the

279
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,640
rest of this playlist, and
hopefully you found this

280
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,740
reasonably useful.
