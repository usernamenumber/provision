1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
   

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,080
Let's see if we can use what we
know about springs now to

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,640
get a little intuition
about how the

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,810
spring moves over time.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,600
And hopefully we'll
learn a little bit

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,660
about harmonic motion.

7
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,010
We'll actually even step into
the world of differential

8
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,930
equations a little bit.

9
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,200
And don't get daunted
when we get there.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,950
Or just close your eyes
when it happens.

11
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,340
Anyway, so I've drawn a spring,
like I've done in the

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,410
last couple of videos.

13
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,150
And 0, this point in the x-axis,
that's where the

14
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,500
spring's natural resting
state is.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,890
And in this example I
have a mass, mass m,

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,220
attached to the spring.

17
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,480
And I've stretched the string.

18
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,680
I've essentially pulled it.

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,480
So the mass is now sitting
at point A.

20
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,710
So what's going to
happen to this?

21
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,330
Well, as we know, the force, the
restorative force of the

22
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,230
spring, is equal to minus some

23
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,360
constant, times the x position.

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,860
The x position starting at A.

25
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,910
So initially the spring
is going to pull

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,870
back this way, right?

27
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,750
The spring is going to
pull back this way.

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,280
It's going to get faster and
faster and faster and faster.

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,710
And we learned that at this
point, it has a lot of

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,870
potential energy.

31
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,110
At this point, when it kind of
gets back to its resting

32
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,940
state, it'll have a lot of
velocity and a lot of kinetic

33
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,680
energy, but very little
potential energy.

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,780
But then its momentum is going
to keep it going, and it's

35
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,950
going to compress the spring all
the way, until all of that

36
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,930
kinetic energy is turned back
into potential energy.

37
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,370
Then the process will
start over again.

38
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,550
So let's see if we can just get
an intuition for what x

39
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,160
will look like as a
function of time.

40
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,980
So our goal is to figure out x
of t, x as a function of time.

41
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,900
That's going to be our goal
on this video and

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,610
probably the next few.

43
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,770
So let's just get an intuition
for what's happening here.

44
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,340
So let me try to graph x
as a function of time.

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,030
So time is the independent
variable.

46
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,440
And I'll start at time
is equal to 0.

47
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,060
So this is the time axis.

48
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,100
Let me draw the x-axis.

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,420
This might be a little unusual
for you, for me to draw the

50
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,860
x-axis in the vertical, but
that's because x is the

51
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,530
dependent variable in
this situation.

52
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,880
So that's the x-axis,
very unusually.

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,940
Or we could say x of t, just so
you know x is a function of

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,100
time, x of t.

55
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,500
And this state, that I've drawn
here, this is at time

56
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,490
equals 0, right?

57
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,400
So this is at 0.

58
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,340
Let me switch colors.

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,020
So at time equals 0, what is
the x position of the mass?

60
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,300
Well the x position
is A, right?

61
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,890
So if I draw this, this is A.

62
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,280
Actually, let me draw
a line there.

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,700
That might come in useful.

64
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,560
This is A.

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,030
And then this is going to be--
let me try to make it

66
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,420
relatively-- that
is negative A.

67
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,670
That's minus A.

68
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,070
   

69
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,200
So at time t equals
0, where is it?

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,920
Well it's at A.

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,530
So this is where the
graph is, right?

72
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,880
Actually, let's do something
interesting.

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,740
Let's define the period.

74
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,880
So the period I'll do
with a capital T.

75
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,950
Let's say the period is how long
it takes for this mass to

76
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,140
go from this position.

77
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,020
It's going to accelerate,
accelerate, accelerate,

78
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,180
accelerate.

79
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,800
Be going really fast at this
point, all kinetic energy.

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,080
And then start slowing down,
slowing down, slowing down,

81
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,800
slowing down.

82
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,390
And then do that whole process
all the way back.

83
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,780
Let's say T is the amount of
time it takes to do that whole

84
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,560
process, right?

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,850
So at time 0 today, and then we
also know that at time T--

86
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,500
this is time T-- it'll
also be at A, right?

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,660
I'm just trying to graph some
points that I know of this

88
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,050
function and just see if I can
get some intuition of what

89
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,590
this function might
be analytically.

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,060
So if it takes T seconds to go
there and back, it takes T

91
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,090
over 2 seconds to
get here, right?

92
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,470
The same amount of time it takes
to get here was also the

93
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,770
same amount of time it
takes to get back.

94
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,880
So at T over 2 what's going
to be the x position?

95
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,780
Well at T over 2, the block
is going to be here.

96
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,690
It will have compressed
all the way over here.

97
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,550
So at T over 2, it'll
have been here.

98
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,440
   

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,680
And then at the points in
between, it will be at x

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,880
equals 0, right?

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,310
It'll be there and there.

102
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,600
Hopefully that makes sense.

103
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
So now we know these points.

104
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,900
But let's think about what the
actual function looks like.

105
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,880
Will it just be a straight line
down, then a straight

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,230
line up, and then the straight
line down, and then a

107
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,690
straight line up.

108
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,220
That would imply-- think about
it-- if you have a straight

109
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,920
line down that whole time, that
means that you would have

110
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,910
a constant rate of change
of your x value.

111
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,550
Or another way of thinking about
that is that you would

112
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,270
have a constant velocity,
right?

113
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,200
Well do we have a constant
velocity this entire time?

114
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,880
Well, no.

115
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,200
We know that at this point right
here you have a very

116
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,650
high velocity, right?

117
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,850
You have a very high velocity.

118
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,700
We know at this point you have
a very low velocity.

119
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,410
So you're accelerating
this entire time.

120
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,150
And you actually, the more you
think about it, you're

121
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,480
actually accelerating at
a decreasing rate.

122
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,610
But you're accelerating
the entire time.

123
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,120
And then you're accelerating and
then you're decelerating

124
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,180
this entire time.

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,420
So your actual rate of change
of x is not constant, so you

126
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,740
wouldn't have a zigzag
pattern, right?

127
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,850
And it'll keep going here and
then you'll have a point here.

128
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,840
So what's happening?

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,980
When you start off, you're
going very slow.

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,860
Your change of x is very slow.

131
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,380
And then you start
accelerating.

132
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,290
And then, once you get to this
point, right here, you start

133
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,540
decelerating.

134
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,410
   

135
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,050
Until at this point, your
velocity is exactly 0.

136
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,820
So your rate of change, or your
slope, is going to be 0.

137
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,890
And then you're going to start
accelerating back.

138
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,610
Your velocity is going to get
faster, faster, faster.

139
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,870
It's going to be really
fast at this point.

140
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,850
And then you'll start
decelerating at that point.

141
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,750
So at this point, what does
this point correspond to?

142
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,820
You're back at A.

143
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,350
So at this point your velocity
is now 0 again.

144
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,350
So the rate of change
of x is 0.

145
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,650
And now you're going to
start accelerating.

146
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,290
Your slope increases, increases,
increases.

147
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,500
This is the point of highest
kinetic energy right here.

148
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,220
Then your velocity starts
slowing down.

149
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,420
And notice here, your slope
at these points is 0.

150
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,640
So that means you
have no kinetic

151
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,710
energy at those points.

152
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,330
And it just keeps on going.

153
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,590
On and on and on
and on and on.

154
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,970
So what does this look like?

155
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,050
Well, I haven't proven it to
you, but out of all the

156
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,610
functions that I have in my
repertoire, this looks an

157
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,700
awful lot like a trigonometric
function.

158
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,860
And if I had to pick one,
I would pick cosine.

159
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,100
Well why?

160
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,210
Because when cosine is 0--
I'll write it down here--

161
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,360
cosine of 0 is equal
to 1, right?

162
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,610
So when t equals 0, this
function is equal to A.

163
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:59,880
So this function probably looks
something like A cosine

164
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,730
of-- and I'll just use the
variable omega t-- it probably

165
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,650
looks something like that,
this function.

166
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,570
And we'll learn in a second
that it looks

167
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,110
exactly like that.

168
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,460
But I want to prove it
to you, so don't just

169
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,690
take my word for it.

170
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,490
So let's just figure out how we
can figure out what w is.

171
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,100
And it's probably a function of
the mass of this object and

172
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,910
also probably a function
of the spring

173
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,400
constant, but I'm not sure.

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,620
So let's see what we
can figure out.

175
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,000
Well now I'm about to embark
into a little bit of calculus.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,380
Actually, a decent
bit of calculus.

177
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,470
And we'll actually even touch
on differential equations.

178
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,790
This might be the first
differential equation you see

179
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,620
in your life, so it's a
momentous occasion.

180
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,120
But let's just move forward.

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,670
Close your eyes if you don't
want to be confused, or go

182
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,290
watch the calculus videos at
least so you know what a

183
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,510
derivative is.

184
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,190
So let's write this seemingly
simple equation, or let's

185
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,570
rewrite it in ways
that we know.

186
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,620
So what's the definition
of force?

187
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,030
Force is mass times
acceleration, right?

188
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,820
So we can rewrite Hooke's law
as-- let me switch colors--

189
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:11,020
mass times acceleration is
equal to minus the spring

190
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,600
constant, times the
position, right?

191
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,840
And I'll actually write the
position as a function of t,

192
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,010
just so you remember.

193
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,230
We're so used to x being the
independent variable, that if

194
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,470
I didn't write that function of
t, it might get confusing.

195
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,770
You're like, oh I thought x is
the independent variable.

196
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,350
No.

197
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,150
Because in this function that we
want to figure out, we want

198
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,270
to know what happens as
a function of time?

199
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,280
So actually this is also
maybe a good review

200
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,080
of parametric equations.

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,630
This is where we get
into calculus.

202
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,880
What is acceleration?

203
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,670
   

204
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:51,650
If I call my position x, my
position is equal to x as a

205
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,980
function of t, right?

206
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,500
I put in some time, and it tells
me what my x value is.

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,510
That's my position.

208
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,890
What's my velocity?

209
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,300
Well my velocity is the
derivative of this, right?

210
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,320
My velocity, at any given point,
is going to be the

211
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,890
derivative of this function.

212
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,130
The rate of change of this
function with respect to t.

213
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,340
So I would take the rate
of change with

214
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,080
respect to t, x of t.

215
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,030
And I could write
that as dx, dt.

216
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,490
And then what's acceleration?

217
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,410
Well acceleration is just
the rate of change

218
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,340
of velocity, right?

219
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,560
So it would be taking the
derivative of this.

220
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,940
Or another way of doing it, it's
like taking the second

221
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,460
derivative of the position
function, right?

222
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:41,850
So in this situation,
acceleration is equal to, we

223
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,930
could write it as-- I'm just
showing you all different

224
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,650
notations-- x prime prime of t,
second derivative of x with

225
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,480
respect to t.

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,930
Or-- these are just notational--
d squared x over

227
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,910
dt squared.

228
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,000
So that's the second
derivative.

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,280
Oh it looks like I'm running
out of time.

230
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,480
So I'll see you in
the next video.

231
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,510
Remember what I just
wrote. just wrote

232
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,900
