1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,350
What we're going to prove in this video is a couple of fairly

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,440
straight forward parallelogram related proofs

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,750
And this first one we're gonna say,

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,870
"Hey, if we have this parallelogram ABCD,

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,970
let's prove that the opposite sides have the same length "

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,570
So, prove that AB is equal to DC and that AD is equal to BC

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,760
So, let me draw a diagonal here

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,160
So, I'm gonna draw a diagonal

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,580
And this diagonal, depending on how you view it is intersecting

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,010
two sets of parallel lines so you can also consider it

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,340
to be a transversal

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,170
Actually let me draw a little bit neater than that

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,390
I can do a better job

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,960
So, nope that's not any better

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,840
That is about as good as I can do

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,970
So, if we look, view DB, this diagonal DB, we can view it

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,880
as a transversal for the parallel lines AB and DC

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,340
And if you view it that way, you can pick out that angle ABD

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,600
is going to be congruent

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,430
So, angle ABD, that's that angle right there is going to be

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,400
congruent to angle BDC because they are alternate interior angles

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,320
You have a transversal, parallel lines

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,640
So, we know that angle ABD is going to be congruent

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,620
to angle BDC

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,730
Now you can also view this diagonal DB, you can view

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,430
this as a transversal of these two parallel lines,

27
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,360
of the other two pair of parallel lines, AD and BC

28
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,260
And if you look at it that way you'll immediately see that angle

29
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:40,520
DBC, right over here, angle DBC is going to be congruent to angle

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:49,650
ADB for the exact same reason, they are alternate interior angles

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,860
of a transversal intersecting these two parallel lines

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,260
So, I could write this

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:03,080
This is alternate interior angles are congruent when you have

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,410
a transversal intersecting two parallel lines

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,630
And we also see that both of these triangles,

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,120
triangle ADB and triangle CDB both share the side over here

37
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,020
It's obviously equal to itself

38
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,030
Now, why is this useful

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,250
Well, you might realize that we've just shown that both of these

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,780
triangles, they have this pink angle and they have this side

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,860
in common and then they have the green angle

42
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,510
Pink angle, side in common and then the green angle

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,830
So, we've just shown by angle-side-angle that these

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,910
two triangles are congruent

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,450
So, let me write this down

46
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,160
We have shown that triangle -- I'll go from non-labeled to pink

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:00,240
non-labeled to pink to green -- CBD and this comes out of

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,160
angle-side-angle congruency

49
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:09,340
So, this is from angle-side-angle congruency

50
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,940
Well, what does that do for us

51
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,790
Well, if two triangles are congruent then all of the corresponding

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,960
features of the two triangles are going to be congruent

53
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,280
In particular, side DC corresponds to side BA --

54
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,940
side DC on this bottom triangle corresponds to side BA

55
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,950
on the top triangle

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,040
So, they need to be congruent

57
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,420
So, DC

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,070
So, we get DC is going to be equal to BA and that's

59
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,990
because they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,300
So, this is going to be equal to that and by that exact same logic,

61
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,920
AD corresponds to CB

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,730
AD is equal to CB and for the exact same reason:

63
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,140
corresponding sides of congruent triangles

64
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,270
And then we're done!

65
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,670
We've proven that opposite sides are congruent

66
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,340
Now, let's go the other way

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,410
Let's say that we have some type of a quadrilateral

68
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,890
and we know that the opposite sides are congruent,

69
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,130
can we prove to ourselves that this is a parallelogram

70
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,530
Well, it's kind of the same proof in reverse

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,740
So, let's draw a diagonal here,

72
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,870
since we know a lot about triangles

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,700
So, let me draw

74
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,120
There we go

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,650
That's the hardest part, let's see

76
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,830
Draw at a -- that's pretty good

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,590
Alright

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,420
So, we obviously know that CB is going to be equal to itself

79
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,080
So, I'll draw it like that

80
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,860
We obviously 'cause that's the same line

81
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,460
And then we have something interesting

82
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,110
We've split this quadrilateral to two triangles: triangle ACB

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,410
and triangle DBC

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,530
And notice, they have all three sides of these two triangles

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,750
are equal to each other

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,890
So, we know that by side-side-side that they are congruent

87
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,790
So, we know that triangle, I'm gonna start at A and I'm going

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:21,650
to the one half side, so, ACB is congruent to triangle DBC

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,550
and this is by side-side-side congruency

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,320
Well, what does that do for us

91
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,720
Well, it tells us all the corresponding angles

92
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,130
are going to be congruent

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,150
So, for example, ABC, angle ABC is going to be

94
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,860
you can see ABC -- is going to be congruent to DCB,

95
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:02,600
angle DCB and you can say by you can say corresponding angles

96
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,790
congruent of congruent triangles

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,980
I'm just using some short hand here to save some time

98
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,280
So, ABC is going to be congruent to DCB

99
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,180
So, these two angles are going to be congruent

100
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,230
Well, this is interesting because here you have a long line

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,030
and it's intersecting AB and CD and we clearly see that these

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,770
things that could be alternate angles, alternate interior angles,

103
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,760
are congruent

104
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,840
And because we have these congruent alternate interior angles

105
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,950
we know that AB must be parallel to CD

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,830
So, this must be parallel to that

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:47,490
So, we know that AB is parallel to CD by alternate interior angles

108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,530
of transversal intersecting parallel lines

109
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,870
Now, we can use that exact same logic

110
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:04,590
angle ACB is congruent to angle DBC

111
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,890
and we know that by corresponding

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,630
angles congruent of congruent triangles

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,320
So, we're just saying that this angle is equal to that angle

114
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,480
Well, once again these could be alternate interior angles,

115
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,460
they look like they could be, this is a transversal

116
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,960
and here's two lines here which we're not sure they're parallel

117
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,110
but because the alternate interior angles are congruent

118
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,700
we know that they are parallel

119
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,960
So, this is parallel to that

120
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:44,510
So, we know that AC is parallel to BD by alternate interior angles

121
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,550
And we're done!

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,430
So, what we've done is interesting

123
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,630
We've shown if you have a parallelogram, opposite sides are,

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,440
opposite sides have the same length

125
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,130
And if opposite sides have the same length then you have

126
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,160
a parallelogram

127
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,540
And so, we've actually proven it in both directions

128
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,730
And so we can actually make what you call

129
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,880
an if-and-only-if statement

130
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,720
You can say, "If opposite sides are parallel of a quadrilateral "

131
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,750
Or you could say, "Opposite sides of quadrilateral are parallel

132
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,780
if and only if their lengths are equal "

133
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,050
And you can say "if and only if"

134
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,100
So, if they are parallel then you can say their lengths are equal

135
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,680
and only if their lengths are equal are they're parallel

136
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,010
We've prove it in both directions
