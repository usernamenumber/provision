1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,585
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,222
And I just want to apologize ahead of time,

3
00:00:03,222 --> 00:00:04,852
because I'm actually in a hotel right now -

4
00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:07,616
- because my wife is at a medical conference,

5
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,187
and I'm using my laptop,

6
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:10,637
with a kind of ad hoc configuration.

7
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:14,464
So it might not sound as good as it normally does.

8
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,412
But let's just try to keep learning.

9
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:18,925
So let's start off the way I start off every video.

10
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,370
But maybe I'll do it a little different this time.

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,689
So I want to start a bank.

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,375
So I use 300 gold pieces, 100 to actually build a bank.

13
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,930
So this is my vault.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,191
The actual physical structure - that took 100 gold pieces.

15
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:37,430
And I'm actually going to initially capitalize

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,851
this bank with 200 gold pieces.

17
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:42,105
Yes, you want to show people

18
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:45,269
what it looks like for gold to be sitting in the vault.

19
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,093
To get the idea.

20
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:52,935
So my initial equity is 300 gold pieces.

21
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:54,107
Thatâ€™s my equity,

22
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:57,688
or whatever my investors initially invest in my bank.

23
00:00:57,688 --> 00:00:59,447
And like all of the other examples,

24
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,646
I start off by taking deposits.

25
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,029
The villagers trust me.

26
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,861
So Villager A comes and gives me...

27
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:08,134
Let me just do Villager A in green.

28
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:15,549
He comes and gives me his 100 gold pieces.

29
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,976
This is just all gold.

30
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:19,615
And then that's an asset sitting in my vault.

31
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,819
And then the offsetting liability for me,

32
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,326
- although this would be an asset for him -

33
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:25,960
is a checking account.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,169
So Account for Person A.

35
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:31,803
And he can write checks against that.

36
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:34,065
And we know how that can be used as actual currency

37
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:37,269
or actually be used to make payments.

38
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:38,839
And then Person B comes.

39
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:47,711
He's a little bit richer, gives 200 gold pieces.

40
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,771
And he wants half of that in his checking account.

41
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,535
And he wants the other half essentially in cash.

42
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:54,923
Or in bank notes, as we've learned.

43
00:01:54,923 --> 00:02:03,216
So this is the account of B. The account of Villager B.

44
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:07,299
And then half of it, he wants in terms of bank notes.

45
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,645
So this liability would be bank notes outstanding,

46
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:15,467
for 100 gold pieces.

47
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:16,849
This is 100 right here.

48
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,168
This is 100.

49
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,299
And I'll print out some bank notes.

50
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,446
Maybe he wants five 20s.

51
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,147
So I'll give him 5 times -

52
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,917
- each of the bank notes might look something like this:

53
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:34,440
20-gold-piece denomination;

54
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,896
have a picture of the handsome bank founder;

55
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,099
I will sign Bank of Sal at the bottom.

56
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,360
I'll give it to him

57
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,025
and then he could use that for transactions with people

58
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:45,372
who maybe don't like to leave a paper trail. But anyway -

59
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:48,325
or whatever, buying a newspaper, whatever he needs to do.

60
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,901
But he can use these and whomever he hands these to,

61
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,037
if they have one of these 20-gold-piece bills,

62
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,733
they can come back to the Bank of Sal

63
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,806
and actually redeem 20 gold pieces.

64
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,691
So it's kind of like a checking account, but you don't know

65
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:02,461
who actually has rights to it at any given moment in time.

66
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:04,785
But anyway, we've done that in the last couple of videos

67
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,230
and we've shown how you can change hands

68
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,738
and how when someone writes a check,

69
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,623
say, between A and B, you're just kind of -

70
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,759
you're just changing what happens in the books

71
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,518
and the gold never has to leave.

72
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:15,151
But let's think about what happens now

73
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:18,293
when we actually start to lend some money.

74
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:22,691
So the old example - if someone had a project that required,

75
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,266
let's say, 300 gold pieces,

76
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,528
we would actually give them the 300 gold pieces.

77
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:29,350
We would actually take it out of our vaults.

78
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,348
They would use that 300 gold pieces to hire the people

79
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:35,570
or buy whatever supplies they needed to actually

80
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,329
do their project and then

81
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,842
those people maybe would redeposit it back in the bank

82
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:41,538
and that process would continue.

83
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,148
What we're going to do now is try to think about,

84
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:44,157
how could we do this

85
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,534
without the bank will ever have to give the gold out?

86
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:49,153
One, it's just a safety concern,

87
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:51,842
and then the gold is just not an easy thing to transact with.

88
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:55,297
If someone wants to sell something worth half a gold piece,

89
00:03:55,297 --> 00:03:56,114
do they cut it?

90
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,873
If someone wants to sell something worth 1,000 gold pieces,

91
00:03:57,873 --> 00:04:00,763
it's a security risk and it weighs a lot.

92
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,145
So what can we do?

93
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,978
So let's say Entrepreneur - let's see, we did A, B;

94
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,360
so let's do Entrepreneur C.

95
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,491
He has an idea.

96
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,873
Let's say it's the irrigation ditch again.

97
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:12,951
And he needs 300 gold pieces.

98
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:17,789
So what we do is we lend him 300 gold pieces.

99
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:28,344
So I have an asset - 300-gold-piece loan to Entrepreneur C.

100
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:31,610
And instead of actually taking it out of my assets here

101
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,940
and then waiting maybe for his laborers to redeposit it,

102
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,966
I can just create a checking account for Entrepreneur C.

103
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:41,914
In fact, it can be maybe part checking, maybe part cash.

104
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,222
What I could do is maybe 100 of it,

105
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:49,076
I can make a checking account,

106
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:52,343
100. So it's an account for C - that's checking account.

107
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,354
And then the other 200

108
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:57,181
I could put some more bank notes outstanding.

109
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,385
This is 200 bank notes outstanding.

110
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:06,900
So maybe I do 20 - maybe he wants it in 10s - 20 times.

111
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,238
And I give him a bunch of these things

112
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:13,076
that I've printed out from the Bank of Sal.

113
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:16,217
And maybe he could use this to pay his laborers.

114
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,473
And if the laborers later on,

115
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:18,978
they don't want to just hold these pieces of paper,

116
00:05:18,978 --> 00:05:20,803
they can come back to the Bank of Sal

117
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:23,882
and get gold in exchange for it.

118
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:26,332
And then let's say another entrepreneur comes

119
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:27,400
and he wants to build a factory.

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,699
He needs 100 gold pieces.

121
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:33,997
I can do is... So he needs 100 gold pieces.

122
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:38,875
So I have a loan, 100 loan. That's my asset.

123
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,347
Loan to Entrepreneur D.

124
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:44,928
And then I can create a checking account for him.

125
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:50,269
So this is account for D.

126
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,588
And I know what you're thinking.

127
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,850
It looks like I'm making money out of nowhere.

128
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,494
I'm just increasing both the left and the right-hand side of

129
00:05:57,494 --> 00:05:59,441
the balance sheet for every new loan I make.

130
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,326
And if you think about, this was actually not that different

131
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,279
when we issued the gold.

132
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,739
It's just that we had to wait for the gold

133
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:07,420
to come back to the bank.

134
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,053
This is essentially a way of keeping the gold here

135
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:12,279
and we just use these checking accounts and

136
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,857
these bank notes as a way of transacting

137
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,341
instead of the gold itself.

138
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,729
So for example, let's say this Entrepreneur D.

139
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,676
He wants to build a factory.

140
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:24,195
Let's say that Person A is the person

141
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,640
who actually builds the factory.

142
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,723
So we have Person D and Person A.

143
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,802
Person D can write Person A a check.

144
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,315
He could write 100 - you know what a check looks like.

145
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:36,320
He'll sign it.

146
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,707
Person D - he'll say it's for a factory.

147
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:42,100
He'll write out 100 here and he'll write it out in words,

148
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,922
however a check looks, it just something that shows

149
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:44,927
it has to be authenticated,

150
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,686
so that when A takes it back to the bank,

151
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:50,204
the bank believes that D actually wrote it in his checkbook

152
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:52,341
as opposed to somehow A forging it.

153
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:59,581
And in return, A is going to build D a factory.

154
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:02,644
And then when A takes this check that he got from D,

155
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,277
brings it back to the bank. Then the bank says,

156
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,293
â€œOK, well, D is going to take all this money out of his account

157
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,550
and we have to transfer it to A.

158
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,057
So I could move that down

159
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,754
or I could just change it to A's color.

160
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,199
I think you can get the point.

161
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,654
All this 100 gold pieces is now A's.

162
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:20,864
And once again, we did not have to change anything.

163
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:23,565
Or we didn't have to deal with any gold.

164
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:24,822
Now the natural question is,

165
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:28,654
how far can this process continue? Can a bank just

166
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:32,989
continue issuing loans and checking accounts indefinitely

167
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:36,130
and essentially collecting the difference in the interest

168
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,266
between the interest it gets on the loan

169
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,402
and the interest it gives on the checking account?

170
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,345
Well, no.

171
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:44,549
Because then a bank take on arbitrary amounts of risk -

172
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:45,994
and there are regulations, although I think

173
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,444
a bank would do it on their own to some degree,

174
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,706
but there're regulations called reserve requirements

175
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:55,292
that tell us how much lending can a bank do

176
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:59,549
relative to its actual reserves.

177
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,894
In this case, it's reserves of gold.

178
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,339
Actually, even a better definition -

179
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,732
how much checking accounts and bank notes

180
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,873
it can issue relative to its reserves.

181
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,255
And in the next video -

182
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:13,826
- the point of this video was showing you

183
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,904
how this loan process can occur with the gold never leaving.

184
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,121
In the next video,

185
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,046
we'll actually talk about reserve requirements

186
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:21,932
and think about why reserve requirements are what they are

187
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:26,579
and what happens if in extreme circumstances

188
00:08:26,579 --> 99:59:59,999
See you in the next video.
