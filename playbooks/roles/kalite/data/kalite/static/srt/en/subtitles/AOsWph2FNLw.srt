1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
In the last video we figured out the probability of

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,770
getting exactly three heads,

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,380
when we have five flips of a fair coin.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,820
What I want to do in this video is

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,330
think about it in a slightly more general way.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,410
We will start assuming a fair coin although

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,700
we will surely see we don't have to make that assumption.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,780
But what I want to do is to figure out the probability

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:30,900
of getting K heads in N flips of the fair coin.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,960
So the first thing to think about is just

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,760
how many possibilities there are.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,630
Well there are going to be n flips.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,090
So literally, there is the first flip, second flip,third flip,

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,590
all the way to the nth flip.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,570
And this is a fair coin, so each of these flips

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,360
contain two equally likely possibilities.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,200
So the total number of possibilities is going to be

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,760
2 times 2 times 2. . . n times.

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,520
So this is going to be equal to 2 to the nth possibilities.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,680
Now let's think about how many of those equally likely,

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,380
these are all equally likely possibilities.

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,440
This is a fair coin.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,840
Let's think about how many of those

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,440
equally likely possibilities involve k heads.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,080
Well, just like we did for the case

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,630
where we thought about three heads.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,850
We say "Well look, the first of those k heads,

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,170
how many different buckets could it fall into?"

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,750
Well the first of the k heads could fall into

30
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,900
n different buckets, right?

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,620
It could be the first flip, second flip,

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,180
all the way to the nth flip.

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,560
Then the second of those k heads,

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,780
we don't know exactly how many k is.

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,200
We will have n minus 1 possibilities.

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,940
And then the third of those k heads will have

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,540
n minus 2 possibilities,

38
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,850
since two of these buckets are already taken up.

39
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,270
And we will do this until

40
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,240
we have essentially counted for all of the k heads.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,250
So this would go down all the way to,

42
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,030
we will multiply. The number of things

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,500
we're multiplying is going to be k,

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,300
one for each of the k heads.

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,240
So this is one, two, three,

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,490
and then you are going to all the way to n minus k minus 1.

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,870
And you could try this out in the case of five.

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,890
When n was five and k was three,

49
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,400
this resulted in five times four times,

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,970
actually we just have to go, times three,

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,320
actually that was this term right over here.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,010
So I am doing a case that is a little bit longer,

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,900
where k is a slightly larger number

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,760
because this right over here is five minus two

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,740
that is this one over here.

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,880
Just not to confuse you,

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
let me write it like this.

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,950
So you'll have n spots for that first head.

59
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,260
N minus one spots for that second head.

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,120
And then you keep going and you are going to have

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,790
a total of these k things you will multiply

62
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,770
and that last one is going to have n-(k-1) possibllities.

63
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,180
And now hopefully it'll map a little better to the one

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,080
where we had five flips and three heads

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,740
because here there were five possibilities for the first head

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,340
four possibilities for the second head, and since n is 5,

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,410
5-2 is three possibilities for the last head.

68
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,950
So this actually works.This is the number of spots

69
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,030
where - or the numbers of ways that we could put,

70
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,290
that we can stick those heads in those,

71
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,770
or that we can put three heads into

72
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,770
five different possible buckets.

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,660
Now just like the last video,

74
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,730
we don't want to overcount things

75
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,400
because we don't care about the order.

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,020
We don't want to differentiate one ordering of heads

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,240
- and I am just going to use these letters

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,420
to differentiate the different heads -

79
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,690
We don't want to differentiate this from this

80
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,160
from this: Heads A, Heads B, or any of the other orderings of this.

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,540
So what we need to do is we need to divide this.

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,510
We need divide these numbers so that

83
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,770
we don't count all of these different orderings.

84
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,460
We need divide these by the different ways

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,480
that you can order k things,

86
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,980
the different ways that you can order k things.

87
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,710
So if you have k things, so you know, one thing, two things,

88
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,100
all the way to k things. How many ways can you order it?

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Well, the first thing can be in k different positions.

90
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,320
Or maybe I'll do it like this. Maybe I will do it thing 1,

91
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,000
T for thing,thing 1, thing 2, thing 3, all the way to thing k.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,520
How mant different ways can you order it?

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,600
Well thing 1 can be in k different positions.

94
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,170
Then thing 2 would be in k minus 1 positions.

95
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,580
And then all the way down to the last one

96
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,100
is only going to have 1 position.

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,920
So this is going to be k times k minus 1, times k minus 2,

98
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,860
all the way down to 1.

99
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,350
And in the example where we had three heads in five flips,

100
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,470
was three times two all the way down to 1 - 3 times 2 times 1.

101
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,340
And so is there a simpler way that we can write this?

102
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,310
Well this expression right over here,

103
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,020
this is the same thing as k factorial

104
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,950
and if you haven't have heard what a factorial is,

105
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,950
it's exactly this thing right over here.

106
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,040
K! (k factorial) literally means k times k minus 1 times k minus 2,

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,490
all the way down to 1.

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,470
So for example, 2! is equal to 2 times 1.

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
So, and actually it's a fun thing to play with,

110
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,290
factorials get large, very very very very fast.

111
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,550
So anyway, the denominator right over here

112
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,590
can be rewritten as k factorial.

113
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,050
And there is any way to rewrite this numerator

114
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,700
in terms of factorials.

115
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,060
So if we were to write n!, let me see how we can write this.

116
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,290
If we are going to write n!,

117
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,850
let me get some real estate over here.

118
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,690
So n! would be equal to n times n minus 1, times n minus 2,

119
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:37,470
all the way down to 1, that's kind of what we want.

120
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,390
We just want the first k terms of it.

121
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,990
So what if we divide this by,

122
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,120
so let's divide this by (n-k)!

123
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,830
So let's think about what that is going to do.

124
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,720
If we have (n-k)! that is the same thing as,

125
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,640
I have to do a little bit of algebraic manipulation here

126
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,220
right over here,

127
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,410
that is the same thing as n minus k,

128
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,700
all the way down to 1. When you divide this,

129
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,280
the 1 is going to cancel out,

130
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
and what you may or may not have realized is that

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,270
- and you can work out the math - everything is going to

132
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,600
cancel out here until you are just left with, up here,

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,630
everything from n times n minus 1 to n - (k - 1).

134
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,080
Because if you expand this out,

135
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,150
if you distribute this negative number,

136
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,630
this is the same thing as n minus k plus 1.

137
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,890
So n minus k plus 1 is the integer that's one larger

138
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,330
than this right over here.

139
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,910
So if you divide out, this would cancel with something up here.

140
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,180
This would cancel somnething up here.

141
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,690
This would cancel something up here.

142
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,120
And we are going to be the left with

143
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,270
is exactly this thing over here.

144
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,160
And if you don't believe me, we can actually try it out.

145
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:21,720
So let's think about 5! over (5-3)!

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,990
so this is going to be 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

147
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,700
So all of that stuff over there, all the way down to 1,

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,140
over 5 minus 3 is 2, over 2!, 2 times 1. 2 cancels with 2,

149
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,150
1 cancels with 1.You don't have to worry about that,

150
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,480
and you are just left with 5 times 4 times 3,

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,860
exactly what we had up here, 5 times 4 times 3.

152
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,740
And so, in general, if you wanted to figure out

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,910
the number of ways to stick 2 things in 5 chairs,

154
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,640
and you don't care about differentiating between those 2 things.

155
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,890
You are going to have this expression right over here,

156
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,060
which is the same thing as this right over here.

157
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:17,300
So you are going to have n!/(n-k)!

158
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,390
and then you are going to divide it

159
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,140
by this expression right over here,

160
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,710
which we have already said the same thing as k!.

161
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,220
So you are also going to divide it by k!.

162
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,860
And then you have a generalized way of

163
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,730
figuring out the number of ways you can stick 2 things,

164
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,580
or the number of ways actually I should say

165
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,310
the number of ways you can stick k things

166
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,410
in n different buckets,

167
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,790
k heads in n different flips.

168
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,920
And so another way of writing,

169
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,490
this is actually a generalized formula for binomial coefficients.

170
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,340
So another way to write this is the number of ways

171
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,750
given that you have n buckets,

172
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,390
you can put k things in them

173
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,410
without having to differentiate it.

174
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,260
Or another way to think about it is

175
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,370
if you have n buckets or n flips

176
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,040
and you want to choose k of them to be heads,

177
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,550
or you want to choose k of them in some way

178
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,240
but you dom't want to differentiate.

179
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,400
So all of these are generailized ways

180
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,210
for binomial coefficient.

181
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,190
So going back to the original problem:

182
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,890
what is the probability of getting k heads

183
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,490
in n flips of the fair coin?

184
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,220
Well there are 2 to the nth equally likely possibilities.

185
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,680
So let's wrtite this down.

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,420
So the probablity of 2 to the nth of the equally

187
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,850
likely possibilities

188
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,540
and how many of those possibilities resulte

189
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,950
in exactly k heads?

190
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,730
Well we just figure that out in during this video.

191
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,600
That's the number of possibilities.

192
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,450
Now probability of a OK idea to memorize this.

193
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,140
But I'll just tell you frankly, you know,

194
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,050
the only reason why I still know how to do this

195
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,510
20 years after first seeing this or whenever I first saw it

196
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,520
is that I actually just like just to reason it through

197
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,600
every time, I like just to figure it out.

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,340
OK, I have got five flips, three of them need to be heads.

199
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,850
The first of those heads can be in five different buckets

200
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,130
that next in the four different buckets

201
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,780
and next was in three different buckets

202
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,490
and then of course I don't want to differentiate

203
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,600
between all of the different ways

204
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,550
that I can rearrange 3 different things.

205
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,420
So I have to make sure that I divided by 3!

206
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,620
by 3 times 2 times 1.

207
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,360
I want to make sure that I divided by

208
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,340
all of the different ways

209
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,330
that I can arrange three different things.
