1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,190
I've pre-drawn some
molecules here.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,370
Let's see if we can use what
we know to name them.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:06,960
So what do we have?

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,660
This first molecule right here,
I have a bunch of rings.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
This is a one, two, three, four,
five, six carbon ring.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,700
These are each four carbon
rings: one, two, three, four,

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,790
one, two, three, four, so the
largest ring is essentially

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,530
going to be our backbone.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,450
It's going to be this six-carbon
ring right here:

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,650
one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:35,410
That is a cyclohexane,
all double bonds.

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,000
That's where we get the -ane,
six carbons hex-, it's in a

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,870
cycle, cyclo-, and then
we have two of

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,740
these four-carbon rings.

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,790
So four carbons, we're dealing
with the prefix

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,520
but-, but- for four.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,155
We've got two of them, so both
of these are butyl groups.

19
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:57,970
   

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,070
But they're in a cycle,
so they're

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,810
actually cyclobutyl groups.

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,220
   

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
We have two things attached
to this ring right there.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,440
If we only had one thing
attached to it, you wouldn't

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,120
have to number it.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,710
But when you have two
things, you start

27
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,280
numbering at one of them.

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,690
Let's say we start numbering
here, and you go in the

29
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,200
direction so that the next group
has the lowest number.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,140
So in this case, you
want to go in the

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,400
counterclockwise direction.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,340
If we went this way, it
would be one, two,

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,700
three, four, five.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,530
This guy would be a five.

35
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,790
If we go in the
counterclockwise, it would be

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,080
one, two, three.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,160
This guy will only be a three.

38
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,420
So this right here, we have
two cyclobutyls, so it's

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,670
dicyclobutyl.

40
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:45,540
   

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,760
We have two of them and
they are at the

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,520
one and three positions.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,210
So at the one and three
position, I have two

44
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,110
cyclobutyls on my cyclohexane
main ring.

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,880
Let's try this one right here.

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,390
I have a five-carbon ring, one,
two, three, four, five

47
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,330
right there, and then I have a
one, two, three, four, five,

48
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,930
six-carbon ring right there,
so this is going

49
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,960
to be the main ring.

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,210
That is a cyclohexane.

51
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,690
   

52
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,850
It has six carbons on them in
a cycle, all single bonds.

53
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,930
Attached to that, I
have a cyclopentyl

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,340
group, -yl for the group.

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,260
This is a cyclopentyl
group on it.

56
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,270
We don't have to number it
because it's only one group

57
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,250
attached to the main ring.

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,140
If there was another group, we
would have to number it like

59
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,310
we did up here.

60
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,540
This is cyclopentyl.

61
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,810
That's this part right here.

62
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,790
Cyclopentyl attached
to cyclohexane:

63
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,040
cyclopentylcyclohexane.

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,410
   

65
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,180
Let's try this one over here.

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,630
The first thing we want to do,
there's no cycles here, but we

67
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,590
have to identify the
longest chain.

68
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,040
To do that, let's just
count it out.

69
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,110
It could be one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

70
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,520
That's not the longest chain.

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,430
Maybe it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

72
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,510
That looks like the longest
chain, so let's make that the

73
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,670
longest chain.

74
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,940
Let's make that the longest
chain right over there.

75
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,820
   

76
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,720
We want to start numbering in
the direction so we encounter

77
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,910
the first attached groups first.
We do want to start

78
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,900
numbering down here, because we
have groups attached right

79
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,650
on the two carbon.

80
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,710
If we started over here, we'd
have to go pretty far until

81
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,040
something's attached.

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,870
So we go one, two, three,
four, five, six.

83
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,970
seven.

84
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,840
eight.

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,910
We know we're dealing with an
octane, all single bonds.

86
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,190
It's not a cyclooctane.

87
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,790
It's not in a cycle,
so we know we're

88
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,040
dealing with an octane.

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,290
   

90
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,730
Now we just have to add
the groups to it.

91
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,540
So what do we have here?

92
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,170
This right here is
just one carbon

93
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,170
attached to the main chain.

94
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,780
This is another carbon attached
to the main chain.

95
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,500
Both of these right here
are methyl groups.

96
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,410
Meth- is for one carbon.

97
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,890
Those are methyl groups.

98
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,730
If you look at all of
them, these are

99
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,650
the only methyl groups.

100
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,820
These two up here aren't methyl
groups, so we have two

101
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,529
methyl groups on our
entire chain, so

102
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,860
it's going to be dimethyl.

103
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,940
Both of the methyl groups our
at our two position, so this

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,820
is going to be 2,2-dimethyl.

105
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
This part right here is 2,2.

106
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,970
That right there is
2,2-dimethyl.

107
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,390
We're going to decide what order
to write it after we

108
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,360
figure out what these are called
because it has to be in

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,780
alphabetical order.

110
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,140
This is 2,2-dimethyl.

111
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,490
The whole chain is an octane.

112
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,100
What are these over here?

113
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,470
How many carbons do
we have here?

114
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,800
One, two, three.

115
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,670
They actually look the same.

116
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,990
We have one, two, three here.

117
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,070
We have one, two, three
there, so these

118
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,550
are both propyl groups.

119
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,140
   

120
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,600
If we deal with common names,
this is kind of that Y shape.

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,920
You could call it sec-propyl
because this carbon right here

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
that's attached to the main
chain is attached

123
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,820
to two other carbons.

124
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,730
But the more common one, because
it forms this Y shape,

125
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,980
is isopropyl.

126
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,470
   

127
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,600
We have two isopropyl groups.

128
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,970
These are both isopropyl.

129
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:24,600
   

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,850
We would have diisopropyl.

131
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:35,520
   

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,890
They're occurring at the four
and five positions, two

133
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,370
isopropyls at four and five.

134
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,620
This is 4,5-diisopropyl.

135
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,050
   

136
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,880
That's that group and that
group right there are

137
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,010
accounted for with this.

138
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,780
Now we have to just figure out
the order that we write it in.

139
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,360
You ignore the di- or the tri-
out front and you just look at

140
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,580
them in alphabetical order.

141
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,570
We have an I for isopropyl.

142
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,410
We have an M for methyl.

143
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,420
Let's write the isopropyl first.
I've actually seen some

144
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,110
people want to go for the p, but
the main thing I ignore is

145
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,940
just the di- or the tri- in
front of the isopropyl.

146
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,950
You shouldn't involve that.

147
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,110
But everything after that,
you do involve.

148
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,170
So I'll write the isopropyl
first. I comes before M, so

149
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,590
this is going to be-- if we were
going to write the whole

150
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:32,890
thing, this is going to be
4,5-diisopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl.

151
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,240
   

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,320
Actually, this should
be a comma here.

153
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,570
4,5-diisopropyl-
2,2-dimethyloctane.

154
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:52,680
   

155
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,580
And we're done.

156
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,800
But this was just
the common name.

157
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,480
You might remember that when we
deal with iso- or sec- or

158
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,400
tert- butyl or propyl, that's
the common name.

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,840
If we want the systematic name,
we can start at where we

160
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,730
are attached to the main chain
and view that as one and then

161
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,230
make the longest chain
with that as one.

162
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,680
And so you could say that we
have a chain there and this

163
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,750
would be both of these cases.

164
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,950
So this is one, two carbons.

165
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,530
Two carbons, we're dealing
with an ethyl.

166
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,270
   

167
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,520
And on the first carbon, you
have a methyl attached to it.

168
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,230
So you could also call each of
these groups a 1-methylethyl

169
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,060
instead of an isopropyl.

170
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,550
So you can either say isopropyl
for each of these

171
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,470
groups or you could call each
of them a methylethyl if you

172
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,850
do systematic naming.

173
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,600
   

174
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,320
We have two of these
1-methylethyl groups, just

175
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,560
like we had two isopropyl
groups.

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,780
If you're using common naming,
you can say diisopropyl to say

177
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,150
you have two of these groups.

178
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,320
When you're using systematic
naming, you don't say

179
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,700
di-1-methylethyl, although that
would probably would get

180
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,650
the point across.

181
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,590
You use bis-.

182
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,560
Since we have two of them,
instead of writing di-, you

183
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,450
write bis-.

184
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,940
You write bis-(1-methylethyl)
That means you have two of

185
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,100
these things right there, and
it's still in the four and the

186
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,710
five position.

187
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,410
If you look at it in
alphabetical order now,

188
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,180
methylethyl comes after
methyl, right?

189
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,610
So the order will now change.

190
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,799
So now if you want to write it
with systematic naming, it

191
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,320
would be written as
2,2-dimethyl.

192
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,490
   

193
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,950
That's these two guys.

194
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,710
2,2-dimethylethyl, then you
would write this guy, so the

195
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,640
order changed for the two
groups just based on how

196
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
they're named.

197
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:56,980
Bis-, and then over here you
have two 1-methylethyl groups.

198
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,810
I know it's confusing, but when
you just break it down,

199
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,090
it actually makes a reasonable
amount of sense.

200
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,100
You have two of these
methylethyl groups.

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,170
Oh, sorry, I forgot where
they're located.

202
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,340
So we have them at the four and
five position, so in the

203
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:20,810
four and five position,
we have two, so

204
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:27,345
bis-(1methylethyl) groups.

205
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:30,230
   

206
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,220
I know it's a little daunting
now, but it all makes sense

207
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,470
when you break it down.

208
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,760
   

209
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,780
And then we can just add
the octane at the end.

210
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,590
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

211
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,430
Octane, and we're done..

212
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,113
Now this might seem more
confusing, but when you break

213
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:47,680
it down, it makes sense.

214
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,680
We have octane as
the backbone.

215
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,240
We have two methyls.

216
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,255
They're both sitting on
the two position.

217
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:57,300
So you have two methyls sitting
on the two position,

218
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,180
and then you have two
1-methylethyl groups sitting

219
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,560
at the four and five
positions.

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,910
So in the four and five
position, 1-methylethyl.

221
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,230
You have an ethyl, and in the
one position you have a

222
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,720
methyl, so that's
all it's saying.

223
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,870
Or another way to think about
it, just in case this doesn't

224
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,590
confuse you enough, you could
call it that, or you could say

225
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,840
4,5-diisopropyl.

226
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,590
   

227
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,950
these two things are the same
thing: common naming,

228
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:22,670
systematic.

229
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,160
Hopefully, you found
that useful.

230
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:25,266
