1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,880
We left off the last video
at the end of 1789.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,580
The Bastille had been stormed in
July, as Parisians wanted to

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,340
get the weapons from the
Bastille, and free a few

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,150
political prisoners to, in
their minds, protect

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,420
themselves from any tyranny
from Louis XVI.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,690
Louis XVI had reluctantly kind
of gone behind the scenes and

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,730
said, "OK, National Assembly, I'm
not going to get in your way anymore."

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,780
Because he's seen the writing
on the wall – that every time

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,364
he's done something, it's only
led to even more extreme counteraction.

10
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:40,482
So, we're at the end of 1789. Already, 
chaos has broken loose in a lot of France.

11
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:44,340
The National Assembly, they're
in process of creating

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,230
a constitution – which won't
fully happen until 1791.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,240
But they're starting to bring
things together in order to

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,560
draft that constitution.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,380
But in August of 1789, they've
already done their version of

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,670
the Declaration of
Independence.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,400
The Declaration of the Rights
of Man and the Citizen.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,290
So if everything was well, we
would just wait until a few

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,055
years, we'd get a constitution,
and maybe we

20
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:11,640
would have some type of a
constitutional monarchy.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,580
But unfortunate, especially
for Louis XVI,

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,560
things weren't all well.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,640
As we mentioned, all of this
was propagated, all of this

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,520
was started to begin with
because people were hungry.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,080
We have this fiscal crisis,
we have a famine.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,686
And so in October of 1789--
we're still in 1789-- October

27
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:39,890
of 1789-- rumors started to
spread that Marie-Antoinette,

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,840
the King's wife, that she was
hoarding grain at Versailles.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,420
So people started imagining
these big stacks of grain at

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,050
Versailles, and this is in a
time where people couldn't get

31
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:51,550
their bread.

32
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,060
And bread was the main
staple of the diet.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,330
So there was actually a march
of peasant women onto

34
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:58,690
Versailles.

35
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,520
And they were armed.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
This is a depiction of the
peasant women marching on

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,830
Versailles.

38
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,240
And they went to Versailles, and
they actually were able to

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
get into the building itself.

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,560
And they demanded-- because they
were suspicious of what

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,870
Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette
were up to at Versailles--

42
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,860
they demanded that they
move to Paris.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,110
So the women's march.

44
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,110
And they were able to
get their demands.

45
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,540
It resulted in Louis XVI and
wife, Marie-Antoinette, moving

46
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,080
back to Paris, where
they couldn't do

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
things like hoard grain.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,380
And they'll be surrounded
by all of the maybe

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,800
not-so-friendly people
who could watch

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,050
what they're doing.

51
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,740
I think the main factor was that
people are hungry, rumors

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,000
are spreading that the King
is hoarding grain.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,780
But there were also rumors that
the King was being very

54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,220
disrespectful to some of the
symbols of the new France, of

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,330
the new National Assembly.

56
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,390
So that also made
people angry.

57
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,480
And across the board everyone
kind of knew, and including

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
Louis XVI, that he wasn't really
into what was going on.

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,970
He wasn't into this kind of
constitutional monarchy that

60
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,740
was forming, this power
that was being lost to

61
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,630
the National Assembly.

62
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,080
So we have this very
uncomfortable situation

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,420
entering into 1790, where the
King and Queen are essentially

64
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,680
in house arrest in a building
called the Tuileries in Paris.

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,610
You have this National Assembly
drafting this

66
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,320
constitution.

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,370
They're charted to draft the
constitution up there.

68
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,030
They all pledged at the
Tennis Court Oath.

69
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,070
And at the same time, throughout
France, you have

70
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,480
some counter insurgencies.

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,840
This is France right here.

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,030
Throughout France you have
counter insurgencies, people

73
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,230
who don't like the Revolution
that's going on.

74
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,360
And then those would
be subdued.

75
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,270
And people are all plotting
one against each other.

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,630
And then you have some
nobility, that says,

77
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,330
gee, you know what?

78
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't like the way
that this is going.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,120
We've seen already a
lot of violence.

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,260
People are angry.

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,910
I'm just going to take my money
and whatever I can pack,

82
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,060
and I'm just going to get
out of the country.

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,450
I'm going to emigrate away
from the country.

84
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,170
So you start having nobility
starting to leave France.

85
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,940
They're called the Emigres.

86
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,760
I know I'm not pronouncing
it correctly.

87
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,120
But you see, you have this
notion of gee, I had it good

88
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,620
in France, I'm not going to have
it good much longer, I'd

89
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,770
better leave. And this same
idea, now that we get to 1791.

90
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,100
So 1790 was just kind of
a bunch of unease.

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,300
Now that we're at 1791, the
same idea of trying to get

92
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,060
away from the danger got into
the heads of Louis XVI and

93
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,890
Marie-Antoinette.

94
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,950
But they couldn't leave
the country.

95
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,420
They didn't trust
Great Britain.

96
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,160
They didn't trust any of these
other countries to safely give

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,340
them shelter.

98
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,070
So one of their generals, who
was sympathetic to their

99
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,690
cause, said, hey, at least
come here to the frontier

100
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,770
areas and you could hide
from all of the unrest

101
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,820
that's going on.

102
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,110
So dressed as actual servants--
and it shows you

103
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,690
what type of people they were--

104
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,940
they dressed as servants.

105
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,840
And they actually made their
servants dress as nobility to

106
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,010
make them the targets in case
they were ambushed anyway on

107
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,475
their way trying to
escape from Paris.

108
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:33,930
Dressed as servants, the King
and Queen-- the King tried to

109
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,360
escape to this general's
estate.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,810
But when they were in Varennes,
right here, they

111
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,700
were actually spotted.

112
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,680
And then the people essentially
took them captive

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,970
and brought them
back to Paris.

114
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,940
So this is called, or you could
imagine this is the

115
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,520
flight to Varennes, or the
flight away from Paris, or

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,620
however you want to do it.

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,520
So already, Louis XVI
started to see the

118
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,110
writing on the wall.

119
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,220
They tried to get away.

120
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,470
But people brought them back.

121
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,560
Now you can imagine, a lot
of people already did

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,380
not like the King.

123
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,340
They didn't like the notion
of even having a king.

124
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,070
And the most revolutionary,
the most radical elements,

125
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,320
were called the Jacobins.

126
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,440
And after the King and Queen
tried to escape and came back,

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,250
they were like hey, gee,
what's the use of

128
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,230
even having a king?

129
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,020
You National Assembly, why are
you even trying to write some

130
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,860
type of constitution that
gives any power

131
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,520
whatsoever to a king?

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,770
We should have a republic.

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,790
Which is essentially-- there's
a lot of kind of nuanced

134
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,660
definitions of what a republic
is, but the most simple one is

135
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,180
it's a state without
a king, without an

136
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,810
emperor, without a queen.

137
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,670
So they're saying, we don't
need, you know-- you National

138
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,030
Assembly, you think you're
being radical.

139
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,410
But you're not being
radical enough.

140
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,160
We want to eliminate the idea
of having a monarchy

141
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
altogether.

142
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,170
And the fact that Louis XVI
actually tried to run away, we

143
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,190
view that as him abdicating
the throne.

144
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,680
Abdication, or essentially
quitting.

145
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,790
And they actually started
to organize in Paris.

146
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,380
This right here is the
Champ-de-Mars.

147
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,190
I know I'm saying it
completely wrong.

148
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,610
This is a current
picture of it.

149
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,850
And so they started taking
signatures in this kind of

150
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,820
public park in Paris to
essentially say, we

151
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,620
don't need a king.

152
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,900
We want to essentially create
our own republic.

153
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,210
That this National Assembly,
they're not radical enough.

154
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,630
And so people started gathering
over here in the

155
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,070
Champ-de-Mars and things
got a little ugly.

156
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,700
So the actual troops were
sent in to kind of

157
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,840
calm everyone down.

158
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,500
And these were actually
troops controlled by

159
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,280
the National Assembly.

160
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,190
The people who are
mainly controlled

161
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,450
by the Third Estate.

162
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,190
But things got a little crazy.

163
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,870
Rocks were thrown at
some of the troops.

164
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,800
Some of the troops, at
first, they started

165
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,430
firing in the air.

166
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,230
But eventually when things
got really crazy, they

167
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,290
fired into the crowd.

168
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,720
And about 50 people died.

169
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,870
And this was the massacre.

170
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,930
Or the Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

171
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,690
I know I'm saying it wrong.

172
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,150
This isn't a video on French
pronunciation.

173
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,180
But you could imagine, now
people are even angrier.

174
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,460
People are still starving.

175
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,910
That problem has
not gone away.

176
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,140
The King and Queen has been
kind of very reluctantly--

177
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,159
everyone is suspicious of the
fact that they're probably

178
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,650
going to try to come
back to power.

179
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,179
They tried to run away.

180
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,549
When the Jacobins, or
in general kind of

181
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,150
revolutionaries, but they're led
by the Jacobins, when they

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,340
start to suggest that, hey,
we should have a republic.

183
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,780
We shouldn't even have a king.

184
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,290
And they gather people here,
all of a sudden, the troops

185
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,510
that are controlled by the
current National Assembly

186
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,650
actually fire on the crowd, and
actually kill civilians

187
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,510
for throwing rocks.

188
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,990
And they might have
been big rocks.

189
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,400
But you can imagine, this is
going to anger already hungry

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,220
and already suppressed
people even more.

191
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,940
And to make people even more
paranoid that the King and

192
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,820
Queen might eventually come
back to power, you had two

193
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,110
major powers all of a sudden
trying to insert certain

194
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,530
themselves into the
French Revolution.

195
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to do a little
bit of an aside here.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,810
Because this is something, at
least you when I first learned

197
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,370
European history, I found
the most confusing.

198
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,120
You have these states,
you can call them.

199
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,820
You have Austria, which I've
highlighted in orange.

200
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,700
The kind of map here
is a modern map.

201
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,370
But in orange, I've kind of
shown what Austria was at that

202
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,080
point in time.

203
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,630
Around 1789, 1790, 1791.

204
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,990
In this red color,
I have Prussia.

205
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,860
I want to show you that these
are very different than our

206
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,470
current notions of
one, Austria.

207
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,090
Austria today is this modern
country right here.

208
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,240
And Prussia doesn't even exist
as a modern country.

209
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
And then you had this notion
of the Holy Roman Empire,

210
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,020
which overlaps with these other
kingdoms, or empires, or

211
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,110
whatever you want
to call them.

212
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,730
And I want to do a little
bit of a sideview.

213
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,240
The Holy Roman Empire, as
Voltaire famously said, is

214
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:27,060
neither Holy, nor Roman,
nor an empire.

215
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,780
And he was right.

216
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,710
It was really kind of a very
loose confederation of German

217
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,090
kingdoms and states-- mainly
German kingdoms and states.

218
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,300
As you can see, it kind of
coincides with modern Germany.

219
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,770
And the two most influential
powers in the Holy Roman

220
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,310
Empire, or actually the most
influential power in the Holy

221
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,260
Roman Empire, was
the Austrians.

222
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,080
And the ruler of the Austrians
had the title

223
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,690
of Holy Roman Emperor.

224
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,940
And that was Leopold II.

225
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:07,310
So Leopold II was the Holy Roman Emperor.

226
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,430
But it's not like he was like
the Roman Emperors of old.

227
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,310
The Roman Emperors of old
actually came out of Rome.

228
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,880
Notice, nothing in the Holy
Roman Empire at that time, it

229
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,890
had no control of Rome.

230
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,870
So it was not Roman, we're
not talking about

231
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,700
people who spoke Latin.

232
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,960
We're talking about people who
spoke Germanic languages.

233
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,340
And it wasn't an empire.

234
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,040
That it wasn't a tightly knit
kind of governance structure.

235
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,560
It was this loose confederation
of states.

236
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,400
But what was the most
influential was the region

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,640
that was under control of the
Habsburgs of Austria, or

238
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,660
Leopold II.

239
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,180
And not only was he in control,
or not only did he

240
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,470
have the title of Holy Roman
Empire, and essentially had

241
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,420
control of the Austrian, I guess
you could say Empire, at

242
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,300
that point in time.

243
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,390
He was also Marie-Antoinette's
brother.

244
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,340
Leopold II, that's
her brother.

245
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:10,780
So Leopold II and Frederick
William II of Prussia, which

246
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,330
is another mainly
Germanic state.

247
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,650
Let me do that in
a better color.

248
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,950
They issued the Declaration
of Pillnitz.

249
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,940
Let me write this down.

250
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,240
So this is going to add even
more insult to injury to just

251
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,670
the general population
of France.

252
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,090
The Declaration of Pillnitz.

253
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,890
And this was done in August. so
I just want to make it very

254
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,910
clear what happened.

255
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,220
In June of 1791, they tried
to escape, they

256
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,700
were captured at Varennes.

257
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,400
Then in July of 1791, you have
the Champ-de-Mars Massacre.

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,270
So already, people are very
wary of the royals.

259
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,810
The idea that we don't need
them is spreading.

260
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,050
And people are getting
angrier.

261
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,960
And then you have the
Declaration of Pillnitz by

262
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,580
these foreign powers, one of
whom is essentially the

263
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,290
brother of the current
French royalty.

264
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,400
And that declaration is
essentially saying that they

265
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:25,090
intend to bring the French
monarchy back to power.

266
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,730
They don't say that they're
definitely going to do it in

267
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,990
military terms or whatever.

268
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,950
But it's a declaration that they
do not approve of what's

269
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,880
going on in France.

270
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,140
And even though they themselves
might have not

271
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,920
taken it too seriously, the
people of France took it

272
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,370
really seriously.

273
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,140
You have these huge powers on
their border right here.

274
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,670
You had the Austrians
and the Prussians.

275
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,200
So this wasn't anything
that people

276
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
could take very lightly.

277
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,330
So it only increased the fear
that the royals were going to

278
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,040
do something to come back
to full power and

279
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,250
really suppress people.

280
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,000
And it really gave even more
fuel for the Jacobins to kind

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,530
of argue for some type
of a republic.

282
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,080
So I'm going to leave you
there in this video.

283
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,710
As you can see, we saw in the
first video, things got bad.

284
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,960
Now they're getting really
worst. Chaos is

285
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,740
breaking out in France.

286
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,470
People are questioning
whether they even

287
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,970
need a king or queen.

288
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,520
Foreign powers are getting
involved, saying hey, they

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,880
don't like what they're seeing
there, with kings and queens

290
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,670
getting overthrown.

291
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,690
Maybe that'll give ideas
to their people.

292
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,630
And by the way, I'm your
brother, so I want to

293
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,470
help you out too.

294
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,080
That scares people even more.

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,560
The current National Assembly,
which is kind of the beginning

296
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,820
of the Revolution, they
themselves are on some level

297
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,310
massacring people.

298
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,850
So it's really leading to a
really tense and ugly time in

299
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,480
French history.

300
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,540
And you're going to see that
that's going to culminate with

301
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,220
what's called the
Reign of Terror.

302
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,110
And we're going to see that
in the next video.
