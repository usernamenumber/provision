1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,330
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,440
Let me erase what I did.

4
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,880
And I should have done this
before starting this.

5
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,350
But it doesn't take too long.

6
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,600
We're on problem number 6.

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,430
   

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,070
And once again, a figure that
has not been drawn to scale.

9
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,680
They do that to you
on purpose.

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,070
Sometimes it is drawn to scale
and they say that it's not.

11
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,040
You shouldn't assume anything.

12
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,330
   

13
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,300
And they're saying that this is
3x degrees, they say that

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,310
this is 2x degrees, and they say
that this is 4x degrees.

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,380
In the figure above, three line
segments meet at a point

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,710
to form three angles.

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,350
What is the value of x?

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,020
Well, what are all of these
angles going to

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,250
have to add up to?

20
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:50,410
If you add this angle plus this
angle plus this angle,

21
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,820
what do you do?

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,230
You went all around
the circle.

23
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,650
So they have to add
up to 360 degrees.

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:03,120
So 2x plus 4x plus 3x is going
to equal 360 degrees.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
And what's 2 plus 4 plus 3?

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,282
That's 9x.

27
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,020
Let me see.

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,870
This is always where
I mess up.

29
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,980
2 plus 4 is 6, 6 plus 3 is 9.

30
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,555
9x is equal to 360.

31
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:17,740
x is equal to 360
divided by 9.

32
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,420
It equals 40.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,800
And that is choice C.

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,780
Problem number 7.

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,910
   

36
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,660
Positive integers x, y, and
z-- so they're integers--

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:46,960
satisfy the equations x to the
minus 1/2 is equal to 1/3, y

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,790
to the z is equal to 16.

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,940
OK, those are the
two equations.

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:02:01,090
If z is greater than y, what
is the value of x plus z?

41
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,640
   

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,770
So the trick is-- because you're
saying, well, how do I

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,350
solve for this?

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,699
Well, the trick is that
you know that

45
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,080
these are all integers.

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,140
So first of all,
let's do this.

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,020
So x to the minus 1/2
is equal to 1/3.

48
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,210
That means that 1 over the
square root of x-- I just

49
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,280
rewrote x to the minus 1/2.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,650
1/2 power is square
root, and the

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,710
negative means the inverse.

52
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,590
So 1 over the square root
of x is equal to 1/3.

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,340
Or you could say the square
root of x is equal to 3.

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,750
x is equal to 9.

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,450
So that was easy.

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,170
We just solve this.

57
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,060
You just have to know that a
negative means to invert, and

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,500
that 1/2 power is the same
thing as square root.

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,670
Now y to the z equals 16.

60
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,240
We've got to come up with
integers y and z where is z is

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,070
greater than y that
end up at 16.

62
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,640
Well, the number that
immediately pops out is 2 to

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,460
the fourth power.

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,250
2 to the fourth power
is equal to 16.

65
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,480
The other option was 4 to the
second power, soon. right?

66
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,060
But 4 to the second power
wouldn't have satisfied this,

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,830
because 4 is greater than 2.

68
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,530
So the exponent has to be
greater than the base.

69
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,180
So 2 to the fourth.

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,730
And we know that because
it has to be integers.

71
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,230
So we know that z
is equal to 4.

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,776
So what's 4 plus 9?

73
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:20,570
It's 13.

74
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,360
x plus z.

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,700
13.

76
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,540
And that is choice D.

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,790
Next problem.

78
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,400
   

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,670
I'm on problem number 8.

80
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,570
And let me draw what
they have drawn.

81
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,750
I don't even know if it's useful
for me to draw, but I

82
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,980
will do it because
they've done it.

83
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,530
And then they have
a semicircle.

84
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,690
So I could do a semicircle,
something like this.

85
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,920
I could draw it-- use the
circle tool like that.

86
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,340
Roughly.

87
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,830
That's good enough.

88
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,090
I could erase the bottom if I
wanted to, but let's just

89
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,140
assume that we only
see this top part.

90
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,030
And they say-- whoops, I'm still
using the line tool.

91
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,110
This point is 4 comma 0.

92
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,029
This point is 8 comma 0.

93
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,160
And they say, in the semicircle
above, the center

94
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,800
is at 4 comma 0.

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,450
Which of the following are
x-coordinates of two points on

96
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,050
the semicircle whose
y-coordinates are equal?

97
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:34,710
   

98
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,270
Well, this is an interesting
question.

99
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,850
Because it's not so much math,
but it really is getting the

100
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,410
intuition of kind of the
symmetry of the circle.

101
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,520
So it wants to know two
points on the circle

102
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,400
where the y is equal.

103
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,430
So, for example, this point
and this point.

104
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,165
The y is going to be equal.

105
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:58,030
And so it would be this
point and this point.

106
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,940
And similarly, we could say,
well, this point and this

107
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,155
point, the y's are equal.

108
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:07,620
If we take down, it would be
this point and this point.

109
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,500
The key is any of these pairs of
points have to be the exact

110
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,780
same distance from the center.

111
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,410
And that makes sense.

112
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,440
If we go the same distance to
the left and go up to the

113
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,055
circle, and we go the same
distance to the right and go

114
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:20,150
up to the circle, they're going
to intersect the y-axis

115
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,350
at the same point.

116
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,950
So we have to look at their
choices and see which of their

117
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,980
pairs of choices are equal
distance from x equals 4.

118
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,840
   

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,650
So the first choice
is 1 and 6.

120
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,530
1 is 3 less than 4, and
6 is 2 more than 4, so

121
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,190
that doesn't work.

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,190
A is 1 and 6, and that doesn't
work because 6 is much closer

123
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,560
to 4 than 1 is.

124
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,000
B is choices 1 and 8.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,350
Well, 1 is 3 away from 4.

126
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,570
Right?

127
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,860
1 is here.

128
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, 8 is all the way here.

129
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,040
So 8 is 4 more than 4.

130
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,560
3 you less, 4 more.

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,740
Doesn't work.

132
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,190
C.

133
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,300
2 and 6.

134
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,140
This looks promising.

135
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,150
2 is 2 less than 4.

136
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,940
6 is 2 more than 4.

137
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,800
So that's 2 less, bam, it's
going to be there.

138
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
2 more, bam.

139
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,310
Going to be there.

140
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,250
So that's our answer.

141
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,660
We don't even have to look
at the other ones.

142
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,980
But if you look at the other
ones, you'll see that they're

143
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,200
all different distances
away from x equals 4.

144
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,440
Next problem, problem
number 9.

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,590
If p is an integer, and 3 is
the remainder when-- OK, so

146
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,890
let me write this. p integer.

147
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:56,370
3 is remainder when 2p plus
7 is divided by 5.

148
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,670
3 is the remainder.

149
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,590
Then p could be-- well, there's
a bunch of ways you

150
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,500
could do it, but really the
simplest way, the very

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,765
simplest way, is to just
try out the numbers.

152
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,710
And let me ask you a question.

153
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,250
When you divide something by 5,
if you get a remainder of

154
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,800
3, what is that number going
to have to end in?

155
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,010
Well, it's going to end
in a 0 or 5, right?

156
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,510
Oh, sorry.

157
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,390
It's going to end
in a 3 or an 8.

158
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,860
Because if something is
divisible by 5, it ends

159
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,350
with a 0 or a 5.

160
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,750
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

161
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,940
All of these are
divisible by 5.

162
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,530
And if you add 3 to any of these
numbers-- 8, 13, 18, 23,

163
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,500
28, and so on, 33-- all of these
numbers are going to

164
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,440
have a remainder of 3 when
you divide by 5.

165
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,140
And then you could also say,
well, any of these numbers is

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,390
going to be the numerator.

167
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,050
   

168
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,040
And then you can actually,
if you want, you

169
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
could subtract 7.

170
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
But actually, we
won't do that.

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,160
What we could do is just try out
the different choices they

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,670
give, and see if any of these
choices create a number that

173
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,645
ends in an 8 or a 3.

174
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:16,060
So let's see.

175
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,990
Choice A is 2.

176
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,460
What is 2 times 2 plus 7?

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,500
It's 4 plus 7 which is 11.

178
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,840
It's not that one because
it ends with a 1.

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,060
B.

180
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,910
3.

181
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,260
3 times 2 is 6.

182
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,260
6 plus 7 is 13.

183
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,370
We're done.

184
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,970
And you can try it out.

185
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,169
If p is 3, 2 times 3 is 6.

186
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,010
Plus 7, 13.

187
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,400
Divided by 5.

188
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,570
Well, the remainder is going to
be-- it's 2, remainder 3.

189
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,550
So it works.

190
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,595
And that was it.

191
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,420
And it's good.

192
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,540
We didn't have to waste time
figuring out C, D, and E.

193
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,000
OK.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,680
And then-- oh, I only
have a minute left.

195
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,340
So I will wait to do the next
problem in the next video.

196
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,590
See

197
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,800
