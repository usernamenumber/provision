1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:07,895
A single postage stamp costs $0.44. How much would a roll of 1000 stamps cost?

2
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:11,706
And there is really a couple of ways to do it, and I'll do it both ways just to show you they both work.

3
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:15,186
One is a kind of a faster way, but I want to make sure you understand why it works.

4
00:00:15,186 --> 00:00:18,251
And then we'll verify that it actually gives us the right answer

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,014
using maybe the more traditional way of multiplying decimals.

6
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:26,726
So, we're starting at $0.44. I'll just write a 0.44.

7
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:31,557
Well, that's one stamp, so this is one stamp. I'll write it like this, 1 stamp.

8
00:00:31,557 --> 00:00:33,752
How much would 10 stamps cost?

9
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:37,167
Well, if 1 stamp is $0.44, then 10 stamps,

10
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,818
we could move the decimal to the right one place,

11
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:43,746
and so it would be, and now this leading zero is not that useful,

12
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:51,532
so it would now be $4.4. Or if you want to make it clear, it would be $4.40.

13
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:56,120
Now, what happens if you want to have a hundred stamps? 100 stamps.

14
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:58,081
Well, the same idea is going to happen.

15
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:02,600
We're now taking 10 times more so we're going to move to the decimal to the right once.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,183
So, a hundred stamps are going to cost, are going to cost $44.00.

17
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,991
And this should make sense for you.

18
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:15,898
If one stamp is 44 hundreths of a dollar, then a hundred stamps are going to be

19
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:20,594
44 hundreths of a hundred dollars, or $44. Or you could view it as

20
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,648
we've just moved the decimal over one place.

21
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,650
So if we want a thousand stamps, if we want 1000 stamps,

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,174
we would move the decimal to the right one more time.

23
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:35,293
Moving the decimal to the right is equivalent to multiplying by ten. So then it would be $440.

24
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:40,606
Now, we could put, add another trailing zero just to make it clear that there is no cents over here.

25
00:01:40,636 --> 00:01:44,057
So if you want to do it really quickly, you could've started with $0.44.

26
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:48,283
And you say, look, I'm not multiplying by ten. I'm not multiplying by a hundred.

27
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:53,221
I'm multiplying by a thousand. You're going to have to put another trailing zero over here.

28
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:58,556
And you would move the decimals from over here to over here.

29
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:04,721
You've essentially multiplied this times ten times ten times ten, which is a thousand.

30
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:10,450
So then this would become $440.

31
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:14,962
So let's verify that this works the exactly the same if we multiply the traditional way

32
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:24,864
the way we multiply decimals. So if you have 1000 times $0.44.

33
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:33,056
So you start over here. 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 1 is 4.

34
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,204
Or you could just say, hey, this was 4 times a thousand.

35
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:39,822
Then we're going to go one place over so we're going to add a zero.

36
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:47,950
And we, once again, we're going to have 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 0 is 0, 4 times 1 is 4.

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,216
Or we just did 4 times a thousand. So that is 4000,

38
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:54,192
if you don't include this zero that we added here ahead of time

39
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:57,002
because we're going one place to the left.

40
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:01,077
And then we have nothing left. I haven't at all thought about the decimals right now.

41
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:05,860
So far I've really just viewed it as a thousand times 44. I've been ignoring the decimal.

42
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,167
So if it was a thousand times 44,

43
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:14,792
we would get 0 plus 0 is 0, 0 plus 0 is 0, 0 plus 0 is 0, 4 plus 0 is 4,

44
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:19,498
4 plus nothing is 4. And if you ignore the decimal, that makes a lot of sense.

45
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:24,437
Because a thousand times 4 is 4000 and a thousand times 40 would be 40 000.

46
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:30,525
So you would get 44 000. But this of course is not a 44. This is a 44 hundreths.

47
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:34,312
We have, between the two numbers, two numbers behind the decimal point.

48
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,368
So we need to have two numbers behind or to the right of the decimal point in our answer.

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,802
So one, two. Right over there.

50
00:03:40,802 --> 99:59:59,999
So, once again, we get $440.00 for the thousand stamps.
