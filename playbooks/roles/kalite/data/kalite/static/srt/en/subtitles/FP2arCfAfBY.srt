1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,160
Hello.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,230
Let's do some work on
logarithm properties.

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,700
So, let's just review real
quick what a logarithm even is.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:19,230
So if I write, let's say I
write log base x of a is

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,020
equal to, I don't know,
make up a letter, n.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,550
What does this mean?

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:35,800
Well, this just means that
x to the n equals a.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,880
I think we already know that.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,150
We've learned that in
the logarithm video.

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,860
And so it is very important to
realize that when you evaluate

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,170
a logarithm expression, like
log base x of a, the answer

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,350
when you evaluate, what
you get, is an exponent.

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,231
This n is really
just an exponent.

15
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,820
This is equal to this thing.

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,910
You could've written
it just like this.

17
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,190
You could have, because this n
is equal to this, you could

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:10,140
just write x, it's going to get
a little messy, to the log

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,930
base x of a, is equal to a.

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,000
All I did is I, took this n and
I replaced it with this term.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,530
And I wanted to write it this
way because I want you to

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,580
really get an intuitive
understanding of the notion

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,390
that a logarithm, when
you evaluate it, it

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,745
really an exponent.

25
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,420
And we're going to
take that notion.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,910
And that's where, really,
all of the logarithm

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,380
properties come from.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,130
So let me just do -- what I
actually want to do is, I

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,760
want to to stumble upon the
logarithm properties

30
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,540
by playing around.

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,405
And then, later on, I'll
summarize it and then

32
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,120
clean it all up.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,100
But I want to show maybe
how people originally

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,040
discovered this stuff.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,960
So, let's say that x,
let me switch colors.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,600
I think that that keeps
things interesting.

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:05,190
So let's say that x to
the l is equal to a.

38
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,680
Well, if we write that as
a logarithm, that same

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,900
relationship as a logarithm, we
could write that log base x of

40
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,410
a is equal to l, right?

41
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,530
I just rewrote what I
wrote on the top line.

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,010
Now, let me switch colors.

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:33,100
And if I were to say that x to
the m is equal to b, it's the

44
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,620
same thing, I just
switched letters.

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,980
But that just means that
log base x of b is

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,730
equal to m, right?

47
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,280
I just did the same thing
that I did in this line,

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,452
I just switched letters.

49
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,620
So let's just keep going
and see what happens.

50
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,770
So let's say, let me
get another color.

51
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,380
   

52
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,010
So let's say I have x to the n,
and you're saying, Sal, where

53
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,710
are you going with this.

54
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,710
But you'll see.

55
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,360
It's pretty neat. x to the
n is equal to a times b.

56
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,260
x to the n is equal
to a times b.

57
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,730
And that's just like
saying that log base x

58
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,420
is equal to a times b.

59
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,460
So what can we do
with all of this?

60
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,010
Well, let's start with
with this right here.

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,420
x to the n is equal
to a times b.

62
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,670
So, how could we rewrite this?

63
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,910
Well, a is this.

64
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,670
And b is this, right?

65
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,010
So let's rewrite that.

66
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,770
So we know that x to
the n is equal to a.

67
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,480
a is this.

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,120
x to the l.

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,370
x to the l.

70
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,500
And what's b?

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,190
Times b.

72
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,740
Well, b is x to the m, right?

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,380
Not doing anything
fancy right now.

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,320
But what's x to the
l times x to the m?

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,730
Well, we know from the
exponents, when you multiply

76
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,390
two expressions that have the
same base and different

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,025
exponents, you just
add the exponents.

78
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,830
So this is equal to, let
me take a neutral color.

79
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,660
I don't know if I said that
verbally correct, but

80
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,300
you get the point.

81
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,560
When you have the same base and
you're multiplying, you can

82
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,930
just add the exponents.

83
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,390
That equals x to the, I want to
keep switching colors, because

84
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,870
I think that's useful.

85
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,590
l, l plus m.

86
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,520
That's kind of onerous to
keep switching colors, but.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,820
You get what I'm saying.

88
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,590
So, x to the n is equal
to x to the l plus m.

89
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,790
Let me put the x here.

90
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,350
Oh, I wanted that to be green.

91
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,530
x to the l plus n.

92
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,050
So what do we know?

93
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,980
We know x to the n is equal
to x to the l plus m.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,220
Right?

95
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,510
Well, we have the same base.

96
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,370
These exponents must
equal each other.

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:18,863
So we know that n is
equal to l l plus m.

98
00:05:18,863 --> 00:05:21,270
What does that do for us?

99
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,590
I've kind of just been playing
around with logarithms.

100
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,840
Am I getting anywhere?

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,590
I think you'll see that I am.

102
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,140
Well, what's another
way of writing n?

103
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,510
So we said, x to the n is
equal to a times b -- oh, I

104
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,350
actually skipped a step here.

105
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,080
So that means -- so, going
back here, x to the n

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,710
is equal to a times b.

107
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,640
That means that log base x
of a times b is equal to n.

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,170
You knew that.

109
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,890
I didn't.

110
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,880
I hope you don't realize I'm
not backtracking or anything.

111
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,360
I just forgot to write that
down when I first did it.

112
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,250
But, anyway.

113
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,070
So, what's n?

114
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,520
What's another way
of writing n?

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,400
Well, another way of
writing n is right here.

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,640
Log base x of a times b.

117
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,840
So, now we know that if we just
substitute n for that, we

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,690
get log base x of a times b.

119
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,080
And what does that equal?

120
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,500
Well, that equals l.

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,230
Another way to write
l is right up here.

122
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:25,570
It equals log base
x of a, plus m.

123
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,710
And what's m?

124
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,792
m is right here.

125
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:35,970
So log base x of b.

126
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,990
And there we have our
first logarithm property.

127
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:44,620
The log base x of a times b --
well that just equals the log

128
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,130
base x of a plus the
log base x of b.

129
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,880
And this, hopefully,
proves that to you.

130
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,460
And if you want the intuition
of why this works out it falls

131
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,400
from the fact that logarithms
are nothing but exponents.

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,250
So, with that, I'll leave
you with this video.

133
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,470
And in the next video,
I will prove another

134
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,900
logarithm property.

135
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,670
I'll see you soon.

136
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,990
