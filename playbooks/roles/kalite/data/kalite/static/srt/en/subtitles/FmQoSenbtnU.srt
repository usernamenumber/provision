1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,370
In the last few videos we learned that

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,160
the configuration of electrons in an atom aren't

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,540
in a simple, classical, Newtonian orbit configuration.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,183
And that's the Bohr model of the electron.

5
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:14,320
And I'll keep reviewing it,

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,900
just because I think it's an important point.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,900
If that's the nucleus, remember, it's just a tiny, tiny, tiny dot

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,570
if you think about the entire volume of the actual atom.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,110
And instead of the electron being in orbits around it,

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,310
which would be how a planet orbits the sun.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,360
Instead of being in orbits around it, it's described by orbitals,

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,680
which are these probability density functions.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,670
So an orbital-- let's say that's the nucleus-- it would describe,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,990
if you took any point in space around the nucleus,

15
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,700
the probability of finding the electron.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,710
So actually, in any volume of space around the nucleus,

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,080
it would tell you the probability of

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,050
finding the electron within that volume.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,850
And so if you were to just take a bunch of snapshots of electrons

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,910
-- let's say in the 1s orbital.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,510
And that's what the 1s orbital looks like.

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,440
You can barely see it there, but it's a sphere around the nucleus,

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,850
and that's the lowest energy state that an electron can be in.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,590
If you were to just take a number of snapshots of electrons.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,460
Let's say you were to take a number of snapshots of helium,

26
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,800
which has two electrons.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,860
Both of them are in the 1s orbital.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,830
It would look like this.

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,140
If you took one snapshot, maybe it'll be there,

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,170
the next snapshot, maybe the electron is there.

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,520
Then the electron is there.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,540
Then the electron is there.

33
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,060
Then it's there.

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,250
And if you kept doing the snapshots,

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,870
you would have a bunch of them really close.

36
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,150
And then it gets a little bit sparser as you get out,

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,160
as you get further and further out away from the electron.

38
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,498
But as you see, you're much more likely

39
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:54,580
to find the electron close to the center of the atom than further out.

40
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,320
Although you might have had an observation with the electron

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,620
sitting all the way out there, or sitting over here.

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,420
So it really could have been anywhere,

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,690
but if you take multiple observations,

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,070
you'll see what that probability function is describing.

45
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,220
It's saying look, there's a much lower probability of

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,400
finding the electron out in this little cube of volume space

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,930
than it is in this little cube of volume space.

48
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,610
And when you see these diagrams that draw this orbital like this.

49
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,565
Let's say they draw it like a shell, like a sphere.

50
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,510
And I'll try to make it look three-dimensional.

51
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,455
So let's say this is the outside of it, and the nucleus

52
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,200
is sitting some place on the inside.

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,830
They're just saying -- they just draw a cut-off --

54
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,950
where can I find the electron 90% of the time?

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,950
So they're saying, OK,

56
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,940
I can find the electron 90% of the time within this circle,

57
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,930
if I were to do the cross-section.

58
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,220
But every now and then the electron can show up outside of that, right?

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,260
Because it's all probabilistic.

60
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,300
So this can still happen.

61
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,570
You can still find the electron

62
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,810
if this is the orbital we're talking about out here.

63
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,380
Right?

64
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,660
And then we, in the last video, we said, OK,

65
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:02,260
the electrons fill up the orbitals

66
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,050
from lowest energy state to high energy state.

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,050
You could imagine it.

68
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,720
If I'm playing Tetris-- well I don't know if Tetris is the thing

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,780
-- but if I'm stacking cubes, I lay out cubes from low energy,

70
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,450
if this is the floor, I put the first cube at the lowest energy state.

71
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,580
And let's say I could put the second cube at a low energy state here.

72
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,780
But I only have this much space to work with.

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,690
So I have to put the third cube at the next highest energy state.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,280
In this case our energy would be described

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,930
as potential energy, right?

76
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,650
This is just a classical, Newtonian physics example.

77
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,460
But that's the same idea with electrons.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,540
Once I have two electrons in this 1s orbital

79
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,240
-- so let's say the electron configuration of helium is 1s2--

80
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,980
the third electron I can't put there anymore,

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,170
because there's only room for two electrons.

82
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,230
The way I think about it is these two electrons

83
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,970
are now going to repel the third one I want to add.

84
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,580
So then I have to go to the 2s orbital.

85
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,090
And now if I were to plot the 2s orbital on top of this one,

86
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,760
it would look something like this, where I have a high

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,380
where I have a high probability of finding the electrons in this shell

88
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:19,110
that's essentially around the 1s orbital, right?

89
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,400
So right now, if maybe I'm dealing with lithium right now.

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,820
So I only have one extra electron.

91
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,960
So this one extra electron, that might be

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,460
where I observed that extra electron.

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,240
But every now and then it could show up there,

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,310
it could show up there, it could show up there,

95
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,360
but the high probability is there.

96
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,100
So when you say where is it going to be 90% of the time?

97
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,730
It'll be like this shell that's around the center.

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,140
Remember, when it's three-dimensional

99
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,030
you would kind of cover it up.

100
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,800
So it would be this shell.

101
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,070
So that's what they drew here.

102
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,000
They do the 1s.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,050
It's just a red shell.

104
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,100
And then the 2s.

105
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,850
The second energy shell is just this blue shell over it.

106
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,560
And you can see it a little bit better in, actually,

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,810
the higher energy orbits, the higher energy shells,

108
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,400
where the seventhâ€˜s energy shell is this red area.

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Then you have the blue area, then the red, and the blue.

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,530
And so I think you get the idea that each of those are energy shells.

111
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,580
So you kind of keep overlaying the s energy orbitals around each other.

112
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,290
But you probably see this other stuff here.

113
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,830
And the general principle, remember, is that

114
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,120
the electrons fill up the orbital

115
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,790
from lowest energy orbital to higher energy orbital.

116
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,400
So the first one that's filled up is the 1s.

117
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,620
This is the 1.

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,330
This is the s.

119
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,530
So this is the 1s.

120
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,460
It can fit two electrons.

121
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,900
Then the next one that's filled up is 2s.

122
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,160
It can fill two more electrons.

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,230
And then the next one, and this is where it gets interesting,

124
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,030
you fill up the 2p orbital.

125
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,180
That's this, right here.

126
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,220
2p orbitals.

127
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,260
And notice the p orbitals have something, p sub z, p sub x, p sub y.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,620
What does that mean?

129
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, if you look at the p-orbitals, they have these dumbbell shapes.

130
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,010
They look a little unnatural, but I think in future videos

131
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,600
we'll show you how they're analogous to standing waves.

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,750
But if you look at these, there's three ways that

133
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,040
you can configure these dumbbells.

134
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,120
One in the z direction, up and down.

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
One in the x direction, left or right.

136
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,760
And then one in the y direction, this way,

137
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,250
forward and backwards, right?

138
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,660
And so if you were to draw--

139
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,410
let's say you wanted to draw the p-orbitals.

140
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,800
So this is what you fill next.

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,780
And actually, you fill one electron here,

142
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,910
another electron here, then another electron there.

143
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,036
Then you fill another electron, and

144
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,190
we'll talk about spin and things like that in the future.

145
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,750
But, there, there, and there.

146
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,590
And that's actually called Hund's rule.

147
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,600
Maybe I'll do a whole video on Hund's rule,

148
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,710
but that's not relevant to a first-year chemistry lecture.

149
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,310
But it fills in that order, and once again,

150
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,010
I want you to have the intuition of what this would look like.

151
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,440
Look.

152
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
I should put look in quotation marks,

153
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,470
because it's very abstract.

154
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,810
But if you wanted to visualize the p orbitals

155
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,810
-- let's say we're looking at the electron configuration

156
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,240
for, let's say, carbon.

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,890
So the electron configuration for carbon,

158
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,360
the first two electrons go into, so, 1s1, 1s2.

159
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,160
So then it fills-- sorry, you can't see everything.

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,660
So it fills the 1s2, so carbon's configuration.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,680
It fills 1s1 then 1s2.

162
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,280
And this is just the configuration for helium.

163
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,210
And then it goes to the second shell,

164
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:30,930
which is the second period, right?

165
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,270
That's why it's called the periodic table.

166
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,960
We'll talk about periods and groups in the future.

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,070
And then you go here.

168
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,690
So this is filling the 2s.

169
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,700
We're in the second period right here.

170
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,120
That's the second period.

171
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,400
One, two.

172
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,820
Have to go off, so you can see everything.

173
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,530
So it fills these two.

174
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,390
So 2s2.

175
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,820
And then it starts filling up the p orbitals.

176
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,830
So then it starts filling 1p and then 2p.

177
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:02,360
And we're still on the second shell, so 2s2, 2p2.

178
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,420
So the question is what would this look like if

179
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,030
we just wanted to visualize this orbital right here,

180
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,420
the p orbitals?

181
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,600
So we have two electrons.

182
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,090
So one electron is going to be in a-- Let's say if this is,

183
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,840
I'll try to draw some axes.

184
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,410
That's too thin.

185
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,960
So if I draw a three-dimensional

186
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,470
volume kind of axes.

187
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,340
If I were to make a bunch of observations of, say,

188
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,770
one of the electrons in the p orbitals,

189
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,230
let's say in the pz dimension,

190
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,690
sometimes it might be here,

191
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,759
sometimes it might be there, sometimes it might be there.

192
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:47,070
And then if you keep taking a bunch of observations,

193
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,000
you're going to have something that looks like this bell shape,

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
this barbell shape right there.

195
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,510
And then for the other electron that's maybe in the x direction,

196
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,500
you make a bunch of observations.

197
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,830
Let me do it in a different, in a noticeably different, color.

198
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,580
It will look like this.

199
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,590
You take a bunch of observations, and you say,

200
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,360
wow, it's a lot more likely to find

201
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,680
that electron in kind of the dumbbell, in that dumbbell shape.

202
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,600
But you could find it out there.

203
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,460
You could find it there.

204
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,360
You could find it there.

205
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,990
This is just a much higher probability of

206
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,630
finding it in here than out here.

207
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,850
And that's the best way I can think of to visualize it.

208
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,840
Now what we were doing here,

209
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,980
this is called an electron configuration.

210
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,610
And the way to do it-- and there's multiple ways

211
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:34,210
that are taught in chemistry class,

212
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,550
but the way I like to do it, is

213
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,890
you take the periodic table and you say, these groups, and

214
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,840
when I say groups I mean the columns,

215
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,610
these are going to fill the s subshell or the s orbitals.

216
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,750
You can just write s up here, just right there.

217
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,630
These over here are going to fill the p orbitals.

218
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,020
Actually, let me take helium out of the picture.

219
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,260
The p orbitals.

220
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,210
Let me just do that.

221
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,070
Let me take helium out of the picture.

222
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,670
These take the p orbitals.

223
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,010
And actually, for the sake of figuring out these,

224
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,970
you should take helium and throw it right over there.

225
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,230
Right?

226
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,810
The periodic table is just a way to organize things

227
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,810
so it makes sense, but in terms of trying to figure out orbitals,

228
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,970
you could take helium.

229
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,490
Let me do that.

230
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,690
The magic of computers.

231
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,050
Cut it out, and then let me paste it right over there.

232
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,490
Right?

233
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,660
And now you see that helium, you get 1s and then you get 2s,

234
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,140
so helium's configuration is--

235
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,290
Sorry, you get 1s1, then 1s2.

236
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,190
We're in the first energy shell.

237
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,920
Right?

238
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:50,910
So the configuration of hydrogen is 1s1.

239
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:57,030
You only have one electron in the s subshell of the first energy shell.

240
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:02,590
The configuration of helium is 1s2.

241
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,380
And then you start filling the second energy shell.

242
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,240
The configuration of lithium is 1s2.

243
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,570
That's where the first two electrons go.

244
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,600
And then the third one goes into 2s1, right?

245
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,670
And then I think you start to see the pattern.

246
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,810
And then when you go to nitrogen you say,

247
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,600
OK, it has three in the p sub-orbital.

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,490
So you can almost start backwards, right?

249
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,250
So we're in period two, right?

250
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,500
So this is 2p3.

251
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,540
Let me write that down.

252
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,200
So I could write that down first. 2p3.

253
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,880
So that's where the last three electrons go into the p orbital.

254
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,110
Then it'll have these two that go into the 2s2 orbital.

255
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,240
And then the first two, or the electrons in the lowest energy state,

256
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,020
will be 1s2.

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,900
So this is the electron configuration, right here, of nitrogen.

258
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,380
And just to make sure you did your configuration right,

259
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,270
what you do is you count the number of electrons.

260
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,600
So 2 plus 2 is 4 plus 3 is 7.

261
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,630
And we're talking about neutral atoms,

262
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,240
so the electrons should equal the number of protons.

263
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,540
The atomic number is the number of protons.

264
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,580
So we're good.

265
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,480
Seven protons.

266
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,050
So this is, so far, when we're dealing just with the s's and the p's,

267
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,926
this is pretty straightforward.

268
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:40,070
And if I wanted to figure out the configuration of silicon,

269
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,130
right there, what is it?

270
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,970
Well, we're in the third period.

271
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,990
One, two, three.

272
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,230
That's just the third row.

273
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,630
And this is the p-block right here.

274
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,670
So this is the second row in the p-block, right?

275
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,830
One, two, three, four, five, six.

276
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,060
Right.

277
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,630
We're in the second row of the p-block,

278
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,200
so we start off with 3p2.

279
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,130
And then we have 3s2.

280
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,630
And then it filled up all of this p-block over here.

281
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,880
So it's 2p6.

282
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,340
And then here, 2s2.

283
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,740
And then, of course, it filled up at the first shell

284
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,810
before it could fill up these other shells.

285
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,390
So, 1s2.

286
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,130
So this is the electron configuration for silicon.

287
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,510
And we can confirm that we should have 14 electrons.

288
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,840
2 plus 2 is 4, plus 6 is 10.

289
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,020
10 plus 2 is 12 plus 2 more is 14.

290
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,350
So we're good with silicon.

291
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,120
I think I'm running low on time right now,

292
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,380
so in the next video we'll start addressing

293
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,080
what happens when you go to these elements, or the d-block.

294
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,120
And you can kind of already guess what happens.

295
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,900
We're going to start filling up these d orbitals here that

296
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,730
have even more bizarre shapes.

297
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,120
And the way I think about this, not to waste too much time,

298
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,310
is that as you go further and further out from the nucleus,

299
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,880
there's more space in between the lower energy orbitals

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,440
to fill in more of these bizarro-shaped orbitals.

301
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,770
But these are kind of the balance --

302
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,560
I will talk about standing waves in the future--

303
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,780
but these are kind of a balance between

304
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,980
trying to get close to the nucleus and the proton

305
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,135
and those positive charges,

306
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:23,290
because the electron charges are attracted to them,

307
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,940
while at the same time avoiding the other electron charges,

308
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,780
or at least their mass distribution functions.

309
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,980
Anyway, see you in the next video.
