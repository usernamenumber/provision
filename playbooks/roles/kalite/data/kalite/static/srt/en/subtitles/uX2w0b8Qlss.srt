1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,063
Let's see if we can better understand what a cash flow statement

2
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:09,311
for my simplified shipping truck example company would actually look like.

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,701
Now I say it's simplified because this is a very simplified income statement

4
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:16,091
for each of these periods. I'm not really showing all the expenses

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:18,506
or all of the details that you would actually have for a shipping company

6
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:20,921
but we really just care about the accounting.

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,918
So let'a just say that at the beginning of this fiscal year,

8
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:26,587
when I started this company, I had $60,000.

9
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:29,884
We know from our example that we used that $60,000

10
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:32,903
to buy a $60,000 truck.

11
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:35,600
And on the cash flow statement you express that saying

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,219
"I spent $60,000 on Capital Expenditure"

13
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:41,587
sometimes it's "property plant and equipment".

14
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:46,600
So you would actually put the $60,000 right over here, on capital expenditures.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,553
and hopefully we'll understand this in a little bit

16
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:52,354
Now remember, the cash flow statement is really a way of reconciling the profit

17
00:00:52,354 --> 00:00:54,484
with the starting and the ending cash.

18
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:56,982
So let's just think about this a little bit.

19
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:59,886
Our profit here, if we just take the number that we have here,

20
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:03,507
Our profit in the first period is $30,000.

21
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:07,222
We're assuming nothing shady is happening with the Accounts Payable,

22
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:10,533
Accounts Receivable, that they're not changing over the course of the year.

23
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:14,559
And then we have depreciation, and we want to think a little bit in this video,

24
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,253
what does the depreciation do to the cash flow statement?

25
00:01:17,253 --> 00:01:19,110
So I'll just write down the number first.

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,918
So we have this depreciation value. This is the truck depreciation.

27
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:27,888
It's not just the expent value of the truck, we're spreading that cost over 3 years.

28
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,906
So $20,000 over 3 years is the life of that truck.

29
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,575
So the depreciation in each of these periods is $20,000.

30
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,688
And what I'm going to show you here is,

31
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:42,162
To figure out the cash from operations from actually how much cash the operations are producing.

32
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:47,985
We want to add back this depreciation to the profit

33
00:01:47,985 --> 00:01:51,618
so our cash from operations is going to be $50,000.

34
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,683
And it might not seem obvious to you at first, but I want you to think about it.

35
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:58,631
This $20,000 that we're showing as an expense in every period,

36
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,392
and it actually might be more obvious if we think about period 2 or period 3

37
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:08,894
We're showing it as an expense but $20,000 did not go out of the door in year 2, or year 3.

38
00:02:08,894 --> 00:02:12,052
We're just showing some of the expense from previous years.

39
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,049
So no cash went out of the door.

40
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,557
So in any of these periods, the depreciation expense

41
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:19,018
should be added back to the operating profit,

42
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,036
to figure out the cash from operations.

43
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:22,687
And you might say

44
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:25,891
"Wait! But we spent that $60,000, especially in year 1"

45
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,956
And that goes here, under Capital Expenditures.

46
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:33,879
The operations didn't push that cash up, the buisness itself,

47
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,225
this is just an investment that we made.

48
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:39,359
So it all works out, because what we see is that we got

49
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,888
$50,000 cash from operations, and that makes sense

50
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,885
beacause our revenue was $100,000

51
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:48,043
just the labor, the cash labor, people's salaries, were $50,000

52
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,318
So that's $50,000 of profit.

53
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,730
This was not a cash expense, so from our operations we had $50,000 dollars,

54
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,814
But then we did have the capital expenditures of $60,000 for the actual truck.

55
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:05,829
So our ending cash would be $60,000+$50,000-$60,000.

56
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,848
So our ending cash is going to be $50,000

57
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:11,170
Now it might make a little bit more sense if we go to the next period.

58
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,185
Our starting cash here is $50,000. It's our ending cash of the previous period.

59
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:19,343
Our profit, once again, is $30,000.

60
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:25,178
You add the profit to the depreciation, you get a $50,000 operating profit

61
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,238
same as the previous year.

62
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:29,932
Or I should say cash form operations, and that makes sense,

63
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,533
because our operations really haven't changed.

64
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,182
We have a very, very steady business.

65
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:36,573
But this year, I have no capital expenditures.

66
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:42,563
So I'm using the same truck as last year. So now Our ending cash:

67
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:46,511
Our starting cash was $50,000, we had $50,000 from operations,

68
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:51,015
now our ending cash is $100,000.

69
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:55,241
So hopefully that gives you a sense of why we add back depreciation

70
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,424
when we figure out the cash from operations

71
00:03:57,424 --> 99:59:59,999
and how it works out in our cashflow statement.
