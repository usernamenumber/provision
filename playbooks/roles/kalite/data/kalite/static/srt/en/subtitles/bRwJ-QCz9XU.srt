1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:04,723
Solve the equation and find excluded values

2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:07,975
and when they are talking about finding excluded values

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,427
we need to think about what values would make these

4
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:14,440
either side of this equation undefined

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,061
and the reason why we wanna do that is because

6
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:19,878
as we manipulate this we might lose things in the denominator

7
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,211
and then we might get some answer,

8
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:23,528
but if it's one of those things that made the original..

9
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:27,919
..the original expressions on either side of the original equation

10
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,876
undefined, then that wouldn't be a legitimate solution,

11
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:33,303
so that's what they're talking about the excluded values

12
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:36,335
so what values do we have to exclude here right from the get go?

13
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,628
Well, 4 over p - 1,

14
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,669
won't be defined if p is 1, because if p is 1

15
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:45,364
then you're gonna be dividing by 0, and that's undefined.

16
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:48,819
so we know that p cannot be equal to 1

17
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,137
and over here, if p is -3,

18
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:52,801
then this denominator would be 0

19
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,102
and it would be undefined

20
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:57,048
and so p cannot be equal to 1, or -3

21
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:00,468
So these right here are our excluded values.

22
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:01,892
so now let's try to solve..

23
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:04,053
..let's try to solve this equation.

24
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,786
and I'm gonna rewrite it over here,

25
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:08,485
so if 4 over p - 1 is equal to

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,518
5 over p + 3

27
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,005
So the first thing we can do, especially because

28
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,417
we can assume now, that neither

29
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,001
of these expressions are 0, and this is going

30
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,535
to be defined, since we've excluded these values of p

31
00:01:18,535 --> 00:01:21,926
is, to get the p - 1 out of the denominator

32
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,186
we can multiply the left-hand side by

33
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,201
p - 1, but remember, this is an equation

34
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:28,518
if you want them to continue to be equal,

35
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,267
anything you do to the left-hand side,

36
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,431
you have to do to the right-hand side.

37
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,900
so I'm multiplying by p - 1.

38
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,119
Now I also wanna get this p + 3 out of

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,252
the denominator here on the right-hand side

40
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:41,135
so the best way to do that is multiply

41
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,878
the right hand side by p + 3

42
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,413
but if I do that to the right-hand side,

43
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,868
I also have to do that to the left-hand side

44
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:50,581
p...p + 3

45
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,064
and so what happens, we have a

46
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:55,105
p - 1 in the numerator, p - 1 in the denominator

47
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,203
these cancel out

48
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,998
so you have just a 1 in the denominator

49
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,799
or you have no denominator anymore

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,153
and the left-hand side simplifies to 4 times (p + 3)

51
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,628
or, if you were to distribute the 4

52
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,133
4 times (p +3)

53
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:14,203
so that is 4p + 12

54
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:16,935
and in the right-hand side, you have a

55
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:19,436
p + 3 cancelling with a p + 3, this is

56
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,785
p + 3 divided by p + 3,

57
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:24,428
and all you're left with is 5 times (p - 1)

58
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:25,948
if you distribute the 5, you get

59
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:29,406
5p - 5

60
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,102
and now this is a pretty straightforward

61
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,233
linear equation to solve, we just wanna

62
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,970
isolate the p's on one side and the constants on the other

63
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,786
so let's subtract 5p from both sides-- I'll switch colors--

64
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,602
so let's subtract 5p from both sides

65
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:48,186
and we get, on the left-hand side

66
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,853
4p - 5p is negative p

67
00:02:50,853 --> 00:02:52,919
plus 12, is equal to

68
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,520
these cancel out, is equal to -5

69
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,936
and then we can subtract 12 from both sides

70
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:02,735
..subtract 12 from both sides, and we get

71
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,723
these cancel out, we get -p is equal to

72
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:08,686
negative 5 minus 12 is negative 17

73
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,202
and we're almost done, we can multiply both sides

74
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:13,601
by negative 1, or divide both sides by negative 1

75
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,918
depending on how you wanna view it,

76
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:19,551
and we get, -1 times -p is..

77
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,727
..so let me scroll down a little bit so

78
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,332
I have a little bit of real state

79
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:26,300
and that is positive p is equal to

80
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,550
17.

81
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,365
p is equal to 17.

82
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,598
And let's verify that this really works

83
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,311
so it wasn't one of our excluded values, but just in case

84
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,332
let's verify that it really works.

85
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:41,792
If we go.. if we have p = 17 we get

86
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:45,630
4 over 17 - 1

87
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,567
needs to be equal to 5 over 17 + 3

88
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,286
I'm just putting 17 in for p

89
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:54,283
because that's our solution!

90
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:58,158
so this is the same things as 4 over 16

91
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,301
needs to be the same things as 5 over 20

92
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:05,132
or 4/16 is the same things as 1/4

93
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:07,117
and that needs to be the same thing as 5/20

94
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:09,267
which is the same thing as 1/4

95
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,866
so it all checks out.

96
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,151
So these are our excluded values and lucky for us

97
00:04:13,151 --> 99:59:59,999
this wasn't one of 'em.
