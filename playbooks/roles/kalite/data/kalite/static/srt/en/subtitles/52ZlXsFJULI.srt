00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,362
Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions.

2
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:08,225
Let's get started.

3
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:12,110
Let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,120
This should hopefully be a relatively easy question.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:23,940
If I were to ask you what one fourth plus one fourth is.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,260
Let's think about what that means.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,358
Let's say we had a pie and it was divided into four pieces.

8
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:35,170
So this is like saying this first one fourth right here,

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,710
let me do it in a different color.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,128
This one fourth right here,

11
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:42,652
let's say it's this one fourth of the pie, right?

12
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:45,560
And we're going to add it to another one fourth of the pie.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,600
Let's make it this one-- let me change the color-- pink.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,060
This one fourth, this pink one fourth is this one fourth of the pie.

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,270
So if I were to eat both one fourths,

16
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,307
or one fourth and then I eat another one fourth,

17
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:04,560
how much have I eaten?

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,922
Well, you could look from just the picture,

19
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,249
I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pie.

20
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:15,218
So if I eat one fourth of a piece of pie or one fourth of a pie,

21
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:17,140
and then I eat another one fourth of a pie,

22
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,643
I will have eaten two fourths of the pie.

23
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,699
And we know from the equivalent fractions module

24
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:27,470
that this is the same thing as that I've eaten one half of the pie,

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
which makes sense.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,140
If I eat two out of four pieces of a pie, then I've eaten one half of it.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,952
And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here?

28
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:38,282
Well the denominators or the bottom numbers,

29
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:41,270
the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same.

30
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:44,335
Because that's just the total number of pieces that I have in this example.

31
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,428
Well, I added the numerators, which makes sense.

32
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:52,634
I had one out of the four pieces of pie, then I ate another one out of the four pieces of pie,

33
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:56,202
so I ate two out of the four pieces of pie, which is one half.

34
00:01:56,202 --> 00:02:01,845
Let me do a couple more examples.

35
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:09,256
What is two fifths plus one fifth?

36
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,750
Well we do the same thing here.

37
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,210
We first check to make sure the denominators are the same.

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,935
We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different.

39
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:21,053
If the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same.

40
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,470
And we just add the numerators.

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:31,078
two fifths plus one fifth is just two plus one over five, which is equal to three over five.

42
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,370
And it works the same way with subtraction.

43
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:42,420
If I had three over seven minus two over seven, that just equals one over seven.

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,351
I just subtracted the three, I subtracted the two from the three to get one

45
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,082
and I kept the denominator the same.

46
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:48,920
Which makes sense.

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,476
If I have three out of the seven pieces of a pie,

48
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,595
and I were to give away two out of the seven pieces of a pie,

49
00:02:55,595 --> 00:03:00,175
I'd be left with one of the seven pieces of a pie.

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,745
So now let's tackle-- I think it should be pretty straightforward

51
00:03:02,745 --> 00:03:04,564
when we have the same denominator.

52
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,860
Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction.

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,400
Numerator is the top number.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,420
What happens when we have different denominators?

55
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,090
Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult.

56
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:24,320
Let's say I have one fourth plus one half.

57
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,180
Let's go back to that original pie example.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,732
Let me draw that pie.

59
00:03:33,732 --> 00:03:37,244
So this first one fourth right here, let's just color it in,

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,460
that's this one fourth of the pie.

61
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,540
And now I'm going to eat another one half of the pie.

62
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,450
So I'm going to eat one half of the pie.

63
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,090
So this one half.

64
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,590
I'll eat this whole one half of the pie.

65
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,280
So what does that equal?

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,180
Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it.

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,200
First we could just re-write one half.

68
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:07,115
one half of the pie, that's actually the same thing as two fourths, right?

69
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:12,126
There's one fourth here and then another one fourth here.

70
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,802
So one half is the same thing as two over four,

71
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:17,667
and we know that from the equivalent fractions module.

72
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,317
So we know that one fourth plus one half,

73
00:04:20,317 --> 00:04:27,168
this is the same thing as saying one fourth plus two fourths, right?

74
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:35,591
And all I did here is I changed the one half to a two fourths,

75
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:40,199
by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by two.

76
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,730
And you can do that to any fraction.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,620
As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number,

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,860
you can multiply by anything.

79
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,553
That makes sense because one half times one is equal to one half.

80
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:54,722
You know that.

81
00:04:54,722 --> 00:05:00,060
Well another way of writing one is one half times two over two.

82
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,480
two over two is the same thing as one, and that equals two over four.

83
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,478
The reason why I picked two is because I wanted to get the same denominator here.

84
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,497
I hope I'm not completely confusing you.

85
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,210
Well, let's just finish up this problem.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,189
So we have one fourth plus two fourths,

87
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:21,160
so we know that we just add the numerators, three,

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,747
and the denominators are the same, three fourths.

89
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:25,180
And if we look at the picture, true enough,

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,360
we have eaten three fourths of this pie.

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,131
Let's do another one.

92
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:44,884
Let's do one half plus one third.

93
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:48,160
Well once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same,

94
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,360
but you can't just multiply one of them to get --

95
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,850
there's nothing I can multiply three by to get two,

96
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,500
or there's no, at least, integer I can multiply three by to get two.

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,880
And there's nothing I can multiply two by to get three.

98
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,860
So I have to multiply both of them so they equal each other.

99
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,815
It turns out that what we want for,

100
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:07,065
what we'll call the common denominator,

101
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:11,120
it turns out to be the least common multiple of two and three.

102
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,380
Well what's the least common multiple of two and three?

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,863
Well that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three.

104
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:23,488
Well the smallest number that's a multiple of both two and three is six.

105
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:27,880
So let's convert both of these fractions to something over six.

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,320
So one half is equal to what over six.

107
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,310
You should know this from the equivalent fractions module.

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,259
Well if I eat one half of a pizza with six pieces, I would have eaten three pieces, right?

109
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,810
That make sense.

110
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,930
One is one half of two, three is one half of six.

111
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,630
Similarly, if I eat one third of a pizza with six pieces,

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,720
it's the same thing as two over six.

113
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,690
So one half plus one third is the same thing as three over six plus two over six.

114
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,970
Notice I didn't do anything crazy.

115
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,205
All I did is I re-write both of these fractions with different denominators.

116
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,040
I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pie,

117
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,820
if that helps at all.

118
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,215
Now that we're at this point then the problem becomes very easy.

119
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:14,245
We just add the numerators, three plus two is five,

120
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,800
and we keep the denominators the same.

121
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:22,647
Three over six plus two over six equals five over six.

122
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,768
And subtraction is the same thing.

123
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:35,142
One half minus one third, well that's the same thing as three over six minus two over six.

124
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:39,520
Well that equals one over six.

125
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,988
Let's do a bunch more problems and hopefully you'll start to get it.

126
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,202
And always remember you can re-watch the presentation,

127
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,198
or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself,

128
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:52,465
because I think sometimes I talk fast.

129
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:55,100
Let me throw you a curve ball.

130
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,320
What's one tenth minus one?

131
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,620
Well, one doesn't even look like a fraction.

132
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,130
But you can write it as a fraction.

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,734
Well that's the same thing as one tenth minus--

134
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:11,296
how could we write one so it has the denominator of ten?

135
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:11,796
Right.

136
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,820
It's the same thing as ten over ten, right?

137
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,320
ten over ten is one.

138
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,880
So one tenth minus ten over ten is the same thing as one minus ten--

139
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,494
remember, we only subtract the numerators,

140
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:31,160
and we keep the denominator ten, and that equals negative nine over ten.

141
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,370
one tenth minus one is equal to negative nine over ten.

142
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,546
Let's do another one. Let's do one more.

143
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,670
I think that's all I have time for.

144
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:47,310
Let's do minus one ninth minus one over four.

145
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,760
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six.

146
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,580
So that's equal to thirty-six.

147
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:01,978
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,010
Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six.

149
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,220
We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.

150
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,850
So we have negative one, so it becomes negative four.

151
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,860
Then minus one over thirty-six.

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,110
Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine,

153
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,070
or we have to multiply the denominator by nine,

154
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,190
so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine.

155
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,360
One times nine is nine.

156
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:35,195
So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six,

157
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:39,898
which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six.

158
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,631
I think that's all I have time for right now.

159
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,731
And I'll probably add a couple more modules.

160
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:47,400
But I think that right now that you might be ready to do the adding and subtracting module.

161
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,162
Have fun.
