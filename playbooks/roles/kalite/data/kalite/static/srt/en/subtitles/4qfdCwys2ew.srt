1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,050
When I introduced you to the
unit step function, I said,

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,440
you know, this type of function,
it's more exotic and

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,240
a little unusual relative to
what you've seen in just a

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,900
traditional Calculus course,
what you've seen in maybe your

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,930
Algebra courses.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,990
But the reason why this was
introduced is because a lot of

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,590
physical systems kind
of behave this way.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,700
That all of a sudden nothing
happens for a long period of

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,530
time and then bam!

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,630
Something happens.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,450
And you go like that.

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,440
And it doesn't happen exactly
like this, but it can be

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,330
approximated by the unit
step function.

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,390
Similarly, sometimes you have
nothing happening for a long

16
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,590
period of time.

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,870
Nothing happens for
a long period of

18
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,350
time, and then whack!

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,760
Something hits you really hard
and then goes away, and then

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,300
nothing happens for a very
long period of time.

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,920
And you'll learn this in the
future, you can kind of view

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
this is an impulse.

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,680
And we'll talk about
unit impulse

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,600
functions and all of that.

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,760
So wouldn't it be neat if we had
some type of function that

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,130
could model this type
of behavior?

27
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,360
And in our ideal function,
what would happen is that

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,910
nothing happens until we get
to some point and then bam!

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,150
It would get infinitely strong,
but maybe it has a

30
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,630
finite area.

31
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,970
And then it would go back to
zero and then go like that.

32
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,660
So it'd be infinitely high right
at 0 right there, and

33
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,630
then it continues there.

34
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,530
And let's say that the area
under this, it becomes very--

35
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,880
to call this a function is
actually kind of pushing it,

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,650
and this is beyond the math of
this video, but we'll call it

37
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,990
a function in this video.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,300
But you say, well, what good
is this function for?

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,610
How can you even
manipulate it?

40
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,800
And I'm going to make one more
definition of this function.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,070
Let's say we call this function
represented by the

42
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,090
delta, and that's what we do
represent this function by.

43
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,420
It's called the Dirac
delta function.

44
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,510
And we'll just informally say,
look, when it's in infinity,

45
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,480
it pops up to infinity
when x equal to 0.

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,525
And it's zero everywhere else
when x is not equal to 0.

47
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,040
And you say, how do
I deal with that?

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
How do I take the integral
of that?

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,220
And to help you with that, I'm
going to make a definition.

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,620
I'm going to tell you what
the integral of this is.

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,690
This is part of the definition
of the function.

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,470
I'm going to tell you that if I
were to take the integral of

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,510
this function from minus
infinity to infinity, so

54
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,750
essentially over the entire real
number line, if I take

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,010
the integral of this function,
I'm defining it

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,490
to be equal to 1.

57
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,590
I'm defining this.

58
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,600
Now, you might say, Sal, you
didn't prove it to me.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,670
No, I'm defining it.

60
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm telling you that this delta
of x is a function such

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,640
that its integral is 1.

62
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,170
So it has this infinitely
narrow base that goes

63
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,810
infinitely high, and the area
under this-- I'm telling you--

64
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,090
is of area 1.

65
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,380
And you're like, hey, Sal,
that's a crazy function.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,490
I want a little bit better
understanding of how someone

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,110
can construct a function
like this.

68
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,520
So let's see if we can satisfy
that a little bit more.

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,880
But then once that's satisfied,
then we're going to

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,540
start taking the Laplace
transform of this, and then

71
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,240
we'll start manipulating
it and whatnot.

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
Let's see, let me complete
this delta right here.

73
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,420
Let's say that I constructed
another function.

74
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,110
Let's call it d sub tau And this
is all just to satisfy

75
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,640
this craving for maybe a better
intuition for how this

76
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,270
Dirac delta function
can be constructed.

77
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,930
And let's say my d sub tau of--
well, let me put it as a

78
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,690
function of t because everything
we're doing in the

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,280
Laplace transform world,
everything's been

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,600
a function of t.

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:40,000
So let's say that it equals 1
over 2 tau, and you'll see why

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,290
I'm picking these numbers
the way I am.

83
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:48,805
1 over 2 tau when t is
less then tau and

84
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:51,260
greater than minus tau.

85
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,640
And let's say it's 0
everywhere else.

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,470
   

87
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,890
So this type of equation,
this is more reasonable.

88
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,130
This will actually look like
a combination of unit step

89
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,120
functions, and we can actually
define it as a combination of

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,460
unit step functions.

91
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,220
So if I draw, that's
my x-axis.

92
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,130
   

93
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,680
And then if I put my
y-axis right here.

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,930
That's my y-axis.

95
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,520
   

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,710
Sorry, this is a t-axis.

97
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,990
I have to get out
of that habit.

98
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,980
This is the t-axis, and, I mean,
we could call it the

99
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,430
y-axis or the f of t-axis, or
whatever we want to call it.

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,160
That's the dependent variable.

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,910
So what's going to
happen here?

102
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,820
It's going to be zero everywhere
until we get to

103
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,870
minus t, and then at minus
t, we're going to

104
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,290
jump up to some level.

105
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,820
Just let me put that
point here.

106
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,825
So this is minus tau, and
this is plus tau.

107
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,010
   

108
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,700
So it's going to be zero
everywhere, and then at minus

109
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,040
tau, we jump to this level, and
then we stay constant at

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,670
that level until we
get to plus tau.

111
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,430
And that level, I'm saying
is 1 over 2 tau.

112
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,080
So this point right here on the
dependent axis, this is 1

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
over 2 tau.

114
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,630
So why did I construct this
function this way?

115
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,710
Well, let's think about it.

116
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,410
What happens if I take
the integral?

117
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,640
Let me write a nicer
integral sign.

118
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,790
If I took the integral from
minus infinity to infinity of

119
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:37,700
d sub tau of t dt, what is this
going to be equal to?

120
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,100
Well, if the integral is just
the area under this curve,

121
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,700
this is a pretty

122
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,900
straightforward thing to calculate.

123
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,440
You just look at this, and you
say, well, first of all, it's

124
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,480
zero everywhere else.

125
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,380
It's zero everywhere else, and
it's only the area right here.

126
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,730
I mean, I could rewrite this
integral as the integral from

127
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,560
minus tau to tau-- and we don't
care if infinity and

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,870
minus infinity or positive
infinity, because there's no

129
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,280
area under any of those
points-- of 1

130
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,230
over 2 tau d tau.

131
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,900
Sorry, 1 over 2 tau dt.

132
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,460
So we could write it this
way too, right?

133
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,910
Because we can just take the
boundaries from here to here,

134
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,130
because we get nothing whether t
goes to positive infinity or

135
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,130
minus infinity.

136
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,380
And then over that boundary, the
function is a constant, 1

137
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,840
over 2 tau, so we could just
take this integral.

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,310
And either way we evaluate it.

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,990
We don't even have to know
calculus to know what this

140
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,680
integral's going
to evaluate to.

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,340
This is just the area under
this, which is just the base.

142
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,130
What's the base?

143
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,275
The base is 2 tau.

144
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:47,940
   

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,550
You have one tau here and
then another tau there.

146
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,240
So it's equal to 2 tau
times your height.

147
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,460
And your height, I just
said, is 1 over 2 tau.

148
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,880
So your area for this function,
or for this

149
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,560
integral, is going to be 1.

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,680
You could evaluate this.

151
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,160
You could get this is going to
be equal to-- you take the

152
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,630
antiderivative of 1 over 2 tau,
you get-- I'll do this

153
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,230
just to satiate your curiosity--
t over 2 tau, and

154
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,750
you have to evaluate this
from minus tau to tau.

155
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,310
And when you would put tau in
there, you get tau over 2 tau,

156
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,550
and then minus minus tau over
2 tau, and then you get tau

157
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,850
plus tau over 2 tau, that's
2 tau over 2 tau,

158
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,110
which is equal to 1.

159
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,120
Maybe I'm beating
a dead horse.

160
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,490
I think you're satisfied that
the area under this is going

161
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,300
to be 1, regardless
of what tau was.

162
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,650
I kept this abstract.

163
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,510
Now, if I take smaller and
smaller values of tau, what's

164
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,450
going to happen?

165
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:56,730
If my new tau is going to be
here, let's say my new tau is

166
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,357
going to be there, I'm just
going to pick up my new tau

167
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:03,320
there, then my 1 over
2 tau, the tau is

168
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,560
now a smaller number.

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,250
So when it's in the denominator,
my 1 over 2 tau

170
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:12,210
is going to be something
like this, right?

171
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,670
I mean, I'm just saying, if I
pick smaller and smaller taus.

172
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,380
So then if I pick an even
smaller tau than that, then my

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,900
height is going to be
have to be higher.

174
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,750
My 1 over 2 tau is going
to have to even

175
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,010
be higher than that.

176
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,860
And so I think you see where
I'm going with this.

177
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,080
What happens as the limit
as tau approaches zero?

178
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:41,169
So what is the limit as tau
approaches zero of my little d

179
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,380
sub tau function?

180
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,070
What's the limit of this?

181
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,370
Well, these things are going
to go infinitely close to

182
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,530
zero, but this is the limit.

183
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,460
They're never going to
be quite at zero.

184
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,050
And your height here is going to
go infinitely high, but the

185
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,400
whole time, I said no matter
what my tau is, because it was

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,340
defined very arbitrarily,
was my area is

187
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,130
always going to be 1.

188
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,860
So you're going to end up with
your Dirac delta function.

189
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,590
Let me write it now.

190
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,430
I was going to write
an x again.

191
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,630
Your Dirac delta function is a
function of t, and because of

192
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:22,130
this, if you ask what's the
limit as tau approaches zero

193
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,220
of the integral from minus
infinity to infinity of d sub

194
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,900
tau of t dt, well, this should
still be 1, right?

195
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,230
Because this thing right here,
this evaluates to 1.

196
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,630
So as you take the limit as tau
approaches zero-- and I'm

197
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,940
being very generous with
my definitions

198
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,020
of limits and whatnot.

199
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,330
I'm not being very rigorous.

200
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,665
But I think you can kind of
understand the intuition of

201
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:44,470
where I'm going.

202
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,630
This is going to
be equal to 1.

203
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,050
And so by the same intuitive
argument, you could say that

204
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,690
the limit from minus infinity to
infinity of our Dirac delta

205
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,600
function of t dt is also
going to be 1.

206
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,000
And likewise, the Dirac delta
function-- I mean, this thing

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,370
pops up to infinity at
t is equal to 0.

208
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,830
This thing, if I were to draw my
x-axis like that, and then

209
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,980
right at t equals 0, my
Dirac delta function

210
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,180
pops up like that.

211
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,970
And you normally draw
it like that.

212
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,730
And you normally draw it so
it goes up to 1 to kind

213
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,670
of depict its area.

214
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,630
But you actually put an arrow
there, and so this is your

215
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,270
Dirac delta function.

216
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,820
But what happens if you
want to shift it?

217
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,800
   

218
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,860
How would I represent my--
let's say I want

219
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,660
to do t minus 3?

220
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,700
What would the graph
of this be?

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,450
Well, this would just be
shifting it to the right by 3.

222
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,100
For example, when t equals 3,
this will become the Dirac

223
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,160
delta of 0.

224
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,630
So this graph will just
look like this.

225
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,550
This will be my x-axis.

226
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,610
And let's say that this
is my y-axis.

227
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,330
Let me just make that 1.

228
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,810
And let me just draw some points
here, so it's 1, 2, 3

229
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,360
That's t is equal to 3.

230
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,390
Did I say that was the x-axis?

231
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,930
That's my t-axis.

232
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:09,935
This is t equal to 3.

233
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,760
And what I'm going to do here is
the Dirac delta function is

234
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,125
going to be zero everywhere.

235
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:18,020
   

236
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,870
But then right at 3, it
goes infinitely high.

237
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,240
And obviously, we don't have
enough paper to draw an

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,230
infinitely high spike
right there.

239
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,440
So what we do is we
draw an arrow.

240
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,660
We draw an arrow there.

241
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,890
And the arrow, we usually draw
the magnitude of the area

242
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,480
under that spike.

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,110
So we do it like this.

244
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,280
And let me be clear.

245
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,600
This is not saying that the
function just goes to 1 and

246
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
then spikes back down.

247
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,080
This tells me that the
area under the

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,400
function is equal to 1.

249
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,810
This spike would have to be
infinitely high to have any

250
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,250
area, considering it has an
infinitely small base, so the

251
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,470
area under this impulse function
or under this Dirac

252
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,250
delta function.

253
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,940
Now, this one right here is t
minus 3, but your area under

254
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,740
this is still going to be 1.

255
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,415
And that's why I made
the arrow go to 1.

256
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,960
   

257
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,050
Let's say I wanted to graph--
let me do it in another color.

258
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,750
Let's say I wanted to graph
2 times the Dirac

259
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,520
delta of t minus 2.

260
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,480
How would I graph this?

261
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,830
Well, I would go to t minus 2.

262
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,010
When t is equal to 2, you get
the Dirac delta of zero, so

263
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,490
that's where you would
have your spike.

264
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,550
And we're multiplying it by 2,
so you would do a spike twice

265
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,820
as high like this.

266
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,250
Now, both of these go to
infinity, but this goes twice

267
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,460
as high to infinity.

268
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,890
And I know this is all being
a little ridiculous now.

269
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,940
But the idea here is that the
area under this curve should

270
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,590
be twice the area under
this curve.

271
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,320
And that's why we make the arrow
go to 2 to say that the

272
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,020
area under this arrow is 2.

273
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,200
The spike would have to
go infinitely high.

274
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,060
So this is all a little
abstract, but this is a useful

275
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,770
way to model things that are
kind of very jarring.

276
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,785
Obviously, nothing actually
behaves like this, but there

277
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:06,160
are a lot of phenomena in
physics or the real world that

278
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,820
have this spiky behavior.

279
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,460
Instead of trying to say,
oh, what does that spike

280
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,180
exactly look like?

281
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,360
We say, hey, that's a Dirac
delta function.

282
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,420
And we'll dictate its impulse
by something like this.

283
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,010
And just to give you a little
bit of motivation behind this,

284
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,200
and I was going to go here in
the last video, but then I

285
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,360
kind of decided not to.

286
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,870
But I'm just going to show it,
because I've been doing a lot

287
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,370
of differential equations and
I've been giving you no

288
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,066
motivation for how this applies
in the real world.

289
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:35,720
But you can imagine, if I have
just a wall, and then I have a

290
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,740
spring attached to some mass
right there, and let's say

291
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,550
that this is a natural state
of the spring, so that the

292
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,790
spring would want to be here,
so it's been stretched a

293
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,340
distance y from its kind of
natural where it wants to go.

294
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,160
And let's say I have some
external force right here.

295
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,330
Let's say I have some external
force right here on the

296
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,600
spring, and, of course, let's
say it's ice on ice.

297
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,510
There's no friction
in all of this.

298
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,940
And I just want to show you
that I can represent the

299
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,860
behavior of this system with
the differential equation.

300
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,680
And actually things like the
unit step functions, the Dirac

301
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,520
delta function, actually start
to become useful in this type

302
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,660
of environment.

303
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:24,610
So we know that F is equal to
mass times acceleration.

304
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,240
That's basic physics
right there.

305
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,940
Now, what are all
of the forces on

306
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,510
this mass right here?

307
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,490
Well, you have this
force right here.

308
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,620
And I'll say this is a positive
rightward direction,

309
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,780
so it's that force, and then
you have a minus force from

310
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,650
the spring.

311
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,100
The force from the spring
is Hooke's Law.

312
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,910
It's proportional to how far
it's been stretched from its

313
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,620
kind of natural point, so its
force in that direction is

314
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,880
going to be ky, or you could
call it minus ky, because it's

315
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,850
going in the opposite direction
of what we've

316
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,250
already said is a positive
direction.

317
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,970
So the net forces on this is F
minus ky, and that's equal to

318
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:13,470
the mass of our object times
its acceleration.

319
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,520
Now, what's its acceleration?

320
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,510
If its position is y, so if y
is equal to position, if we

321
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,070
take the derivative of y with
respect to t, y prime, which

322
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,570
we could also say dy dt, this
is going to be its velocity.

323
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,210
And then if we take the
derivative of that, y prime

324
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,200
prime, which is equal to d
squared y with respect to dt

325
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,940
squared, this is equal
to acceleration.

326
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,080
   

327
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,340
So instead of writing a, we
could right y prime prime.

328
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,110
And so, if we just put this
on the other side of the

329
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,010
equation, what do we get?

330
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,270
We get the force-- this force,
not just this force; this was

331
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,540
just F equals ma-- but this
force is equal to the mass of

332
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,610
our object, times the
acceleration of the object

333
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,400
plus whatever the spring
constant is for the spring

334
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,140
plus k times our position,
times y.

335
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,580
So if you had no outside force,
if this was zero you'd

336
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,370
have a homogeneous differential
equation.

337
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,150
And in that case, the spring
would just start

338
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,560
moving on its own.

339
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,590
But now this F, all of a
sudden, it's kind of a

340
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,610
non-homogeneous term, it's what
the outside force you're

341
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,900
applying to this mass.

342
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,780
So if this outside force was
some type of Dirac delta

343
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,310
function-- so let's say it's t
minus 2 is equal to our mass

344
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:50,190
times y prime prime plus our
spring constant times y, this

345
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,180
is saying that at time is equal
to 2 seconds, we're just

346
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,770
going to jar this thing
to the right.

347
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,960
And it's going to have an-- and
I'll talk more about it--

348
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,360
it's going to have
an impulse of 2.

349
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,280
It's force times time is going
to be-- or its impulse is

350
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,910
going to have 1.

351
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,560
And I don't want to get too much
into the physics here,

352
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,630
but its impulse or its change in
momentum, is going to be of

353
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,430
magnitude 1, depending on
what our units are.

354
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,890
But anyway, I just wanted to
take a slight diversion,

355
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,329
because you might think Sal is
introducing me to these weird,

356
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,349
exotic functions.

357
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,569
What are they ever going
to be good for?

358
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,369
But this is good for the idea
that sometimes you just jar

359
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,750
this thing by some magnitude
and then let go.

360
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,790
And you do it kind of infinitely
fast, but you do it

361
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,540
enough to change the momentum of
this in a well-defined way.

362
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,140
Anyway, in the next video, we'll
continue with the Dirac

363
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,870
delta function.

364
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,830
We'll figure out its Laplace
transform and see what it does

365
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,650
to the Laplace transforms
of other functions.
