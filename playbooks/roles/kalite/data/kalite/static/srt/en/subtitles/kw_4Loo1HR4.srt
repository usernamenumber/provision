1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,935
At the end of the last
video, I left you

4
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,990
with a bit of a question.

5
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,370
We had a situation where we
had a 1 kilogram object.

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,890
This is the 1 kilogram object,
which I've drawn neater in

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,955
this video.

8
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,910
That is 1 kilogram.

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,110
And we're on earth, and I need
to mention that because

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,380
gravity is different from
planet to planet.

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,670
But as I mentioned,
I'm holding it.

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,200
Let's say I'm holding it 10
meters above the ground.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,590
So this distance or this
height is 10 meters.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
And we're assuming the
acceleration of gravity, which

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
we also write as just g, let's
assume it's just 10 meters per

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,680
second squared just for the
simplicity of the math instead

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
of the 9.8.

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,560
So what we learned in the last
video is that the potential

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,690
energy in this situation, the
potential energy, which equals

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,740
m times g times h is equal to
the mass is 1 kilogram times

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,300
the acceleration of gravity,
which is 10

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,490
meters per second squared.

23
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,349
I'm not going to write the units
down just to save space,

24
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:08,890
although you should do this when
you do it on your test.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,920
And then the height
is 10 meters.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,910
And the units, if you work them
all out, it's in newton

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,960
meters or joules and so it's
equal to 100 joules.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,400
That's the potential energy when
I'm holding it up there.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,290
And I asked you, well when
I let go, what happens?

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,490
Well the block obviously
will start falling.

31
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,370
And not only falling, it will
start accelerating to the

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,870
ground at 10 meters per second
squared roughly.

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,940
And right before it hits the
ground-- let me draw that in

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,640
brown for ground-- right before
the object hits the

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,130
ground or actually right when it
hits the ground, what will

36
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,490
be the potential energy
of the object?

37
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,070
Well it has no height, right?

38
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,790
Potential energy is mgh.

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,810
The mass and the acceleration of
gravity stay the same, but

40
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,470
the height is 0.

41
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,460
So they're all multiplied
by each other.

42
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,540
So down here, the potential
energy is going

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,360
to be equal to 0.

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,120
And I told you in the last video
that we have the law of

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,160
conservation of energy.

46
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,950
That energy is conserved.

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,510
It cannot be created
or destroyed.

48
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,920
It can just be converted from
one form to another.

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,919
But I'm just showing you, this
object had 100 joules of

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,010
energy or, in this case,

51
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,920
gravitational potential energy.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,820
And down here, it
has no energy.

53
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,780
Or at least it has no
gravitational potential

54
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,130
energy, and that's the key.

55
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,800
That gravitational potential
energy was converted into

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
something else.

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
And that something else
it was converted

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,070
into is kinetic energy.

59
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,800
And in this case, since it has
no potential energy, all of

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,580
that previous potential energy,
all of this 100 joules

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,880
that it has up here is now going
to be converted into

62
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,800
kinetic energy.

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,620
And we can use that information
to figure out its

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,980
velocity right before
it hits the ground.

65
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,760
So how do we do that?

66
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,770
Well what's the formula
for kinetic energy?

67
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,615
And we solved it two videos
ago, and hopefully it

68
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:53,677
shouldn't be too much
of a mystery to you.

69
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,840
It's something good to memorize,
but it's also good

70
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,870
to know how we got it and go
back two videos if you forgot.

71
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,430
   

72
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,440
So first we know that all the
potential energy was converted

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,450
into kinetic energy.

74
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,330
We had 100 joules of potential
energy, so we're still going

75
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,210
to have 100 joules, but now
all of it's going to be

76
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,350
kinetic energy.

77
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,810
And kinetic energy is
1/2 mv squared.

78
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,080
So we know that 1/2 mv squared,
or the kinetic

79
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,990
energy, is now going to
equal 100 joules.

80
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,710
What's the mass?

81
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,960
The mass is 1.

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,930
And we can solve for v now.

83
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,910
1/2 v squared equals
100 joules, and v

84
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,050
squared is equal to 200.

85
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,310
And then we get v is equal to
square root of 200, which is

86
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,560
something over 14.

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,860
We can get the exact number.

88
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,725
Let's see, 200 square
root, 14.1 roughly.

89
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:51,360
The velocity is going to
be 14.1 meters per

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,870
second squared downwards.

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,500
Right before the object
touches the ground.

92
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,930
Right before it touches
the ground.

93
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,180
And you might say, well Sal
that's nice and everything.

94
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,170
We learned a little
bit about energy.

95
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,890
I could have solved that or
hopefully you could have

96
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,990
solved that problem just using
your kinematics formula.

97
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,550
So what's the whole point
of introducing

98
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,590
these concepts of energy?

99
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,280
And I will now show you.

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
So let's say they have the same
1 kilogram object up here

101
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,529
and it's 10 meters in the air,
but I'm going to change things

102
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,779
a little bit.

103
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,660
   

104
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,970
Let me see if I can competently
erase all of this.

105
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,940
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

106
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,920
   

107
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,900
OK, there you go.

108
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm trying my best to erase
this, all of this stuff.

109
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,570
OK.

110
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,770
So I have the same object.

111
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,025
It's still 10 meters
in the air and I'll

112
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,390
write that in a second.

113
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,160
And I'm just holding it there
and I'm still going to drop

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,130
it, but something interesting
is going to happen.

115
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,880
Instead of it going straight
down, it's actually going to

116
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,610
drop on this ramp of ice.

117
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,180
   

118
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,710
The ice has lumps on it.

119
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,600
   

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,660
And then this is the bottom.

121
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,510
This is the ground down here.

122
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,310
This is the ground.

123
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,070
So what's going to
happen this time?

124
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,130
I'm still 10 meters in the
air, so let me draw that.

125
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,130
That's still 10 meters.

126
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,360
I should switch colors just
so not everything is ice.

127
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,190
So that's still 10 meters, but
instead of the object going

128
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,090
straight down now, it's going to
go down here and then start

129
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,840
sliding, right?

130
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
It's going to go sliding
along this hill.

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,870
And then at this point it's
going to be going really fast

132
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,010
in the horizontal direction.

133
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,760
And right now we don't
know how fast.

134
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,630
And just using our kinematics
formula, this would have been

135
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,880
a really tough formula.

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,630
This would have been
difficult.

137
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,400
I mean you could have attempted
it and it actually

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,990
would have taken calculus
because the angle of the slope

139
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,150
changes continuously.

140
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,990
We don't even know the formula
for the angle of the slope.

141
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,410
You would have had to break
it out into vectors.

142
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,690
You would have to do all sorts
of complicated things.

143
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,050
This would have been a nearly
impossible problem.

144
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,050
But using energy, we can
actually figure out what the

145
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,680
velocity of this object
is at this point.

146
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,880
And we use the same idea.

147
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,330
Here we have 100 joules
of potential energy.

148
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,070
We just figured that out.

149
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,190
Down here, what's the height
above the ground?

150
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,570
Well the height is 0.

151
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,580
So all the potential energy
has disappeared.

152
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,270
And just like in the previous
situation, all of the

153
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,530
potential energy is now
converted into kinetic energy.

154
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,520
And so what is that kinetic
energy going to equal?

155
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,440
It's going to be equal to the
initial potential energy.

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,150
So here the kinetic energy
is equal to 100 joules.

157
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,090
And that equals 1/2
mv squared, just

158
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,300
like we just solved.

159
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,380
And if you solve for v, the
mass is 1 kilogram.

160
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,690
So the velocity in the
horizontal direction will be,

161
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,400
if you solve for it, 14.1
meters per second.

162
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
Instead of going straight down,
now it's going to be

163
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,300
going in the horizontal
to the right.

164
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,270
And the reason why I said it
was ice is because I wanted

165
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,360
this to be frictionless and I
didn't want any energy lost to

166
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,760
heat or anything like that.

167
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,320
And you might say OK Sal, that's
kind of interesting.

168
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,990
And you kind of got the same
number for the velocity than

169
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,870
if I just dropped the object
straight down.

170
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,660
And that's interesting.

171
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,910
But what else can
this do for me?

172
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,100
And this is where it's
really cool.

173
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,080
Not only can I figure out the
velocity when all of the

174
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,100
potential energy has
disappeared, but I can figure

175
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,180
out the velocity of any
point-- and this is

176
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,460
fascinating-- along
this slide.

177
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,200
So let's say when the box is
sliding down here, so let's

178
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,600
say the box is at this point.

179
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,630
It changes colors
too as it falls.

180
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,510
So this is the 1 kilogram
box, right?

181
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,840
It falls and it slides
down here.

182
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,480
And let's say at this point it's
height above the ground

183
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,750
is 5 meters.

184
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,860
So what's its potential
energy here?

185
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,770
So let's just write something.

186
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,810
All of the energy is
conserved, right?

187
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,080
So the initial potential
energy plus the initial

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,360
kinetic energy is equal to the
final potential energy plus

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,960
the final kinetic energy.

190
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,100
I'm just saying energy
is conserved here.

191
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,580
Up here, what's the initial
total energy in the system?

192
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,400
Well the potential energy is 100
and the kinetic energy is

193
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,420
0 because it's stationary.

194
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,880
I haven't dropped it.

195
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,090
I haven't let go of it yet.

196
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,360
It's just stationary.

197
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,530
So the initial energy is going
to be equal to 100 joules.

198
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,830
That's cause this is
0 and this is 100.

199
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,840
So the initial energy
is 100 joules.

200
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,500
At this point right here, what's
the potential energy?

201
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,270
Well we're 5 meters
up, so mass times

202
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,990
gravity times height.

203
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,900
Mass is 1, times gravity, 10
meters per second squared.

204
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,049
Times height, times 5.

205
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,630
So it's 50 joules.

206
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,409
That's our potential energy
at this point.

207
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,130
And then we must have some
kinetic energy with the

208
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,250
velocity going roughly
in that direction.

209
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,950
Plus our kinetic energy
at this point.

210
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,560
And we know that no energy
was destroyed.

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,330
It's just converted.

212
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,080
So we know the total energy
still has to be 100 joules.

213
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,410
So essentially what happened,
and if we solve for this--

214
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,430
it's very easy, subtract 50 from
both sides-- we know that

215
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,120
the kinetic energy is
now also going to

216
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,100
be equal to 50 joules.

217
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,890
So what happened?

218
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,370
Halfway down, essentially half
of the potential energy got

219
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,120
converted to kinetic energy.

220
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
And we can use this information
that the kinetic

221
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,230
energy is 50 joules
to figure out the

222
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,170
velocity at this point.

223
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,840
1/2 mv squared is equal to 50.

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,080
The mass is 1.

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,530
Multiply both sides by 2.

226
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,370
You get v squared
is equal to 100.

227
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,570
The velocity is 10 meters
per second along

228
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,390
this crazy, icy slide.

229
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,970
And that is something that I
would have challenged you to

230
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,670
solve using traditional
kinematics formulas,

231
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,500
especially considering that we
don't know really much about

232
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,490
the surface of this slide.

233
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,930
And even if we did, that would
have been a million times

234
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,440
harder than just using the law
of conservation of energy and

235
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,380
realizing that at this point,
half the potential energy is

236
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,620
now kinetic energy and
it's going along the

237
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
direction of the slide.

238
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,870
I will see you in
the next video.

239
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,900
