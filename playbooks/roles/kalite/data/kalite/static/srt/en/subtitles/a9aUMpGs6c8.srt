1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:02,290
In the last few videos we have been talking

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,706
about the Production Possibilities Frontiers.

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:07,460
A relatively static thing, something you couldn't change

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,239
but you could move along.

5
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,099
What I want to do in this video is

6
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,854
think about maybe there are ways

7
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:16,859
to change or expand the Production Possibilities Frontier.

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,075
And to do that, let's assume that our little

9
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:21,806
hunter-gatherer has decided to become a strict carnivore.

10
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:24,133
So he's only focused on rabbits now.

11
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:27,399
And his whole happiness in life is optimising

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,348
the number of rabbits he can catch and eat in a given day.

13
00:00:31,348 --> 00:00:35,718
And so let's, on one axis, let's draw

14
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:39,313
the number of rabbits that he can catch in a given day.

15
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:47,391
So say it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, I can keep going on and on.

16
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:51,829
So this right over here is rabbits

17
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,267
that he can catch in a given day.

18
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,042
But remember, he wants to optimise this.

19
00:00:58,042 --> 00:01:00,418
He wants to think about how he can increase

20
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:03,260
his productivity in terms of the number of rabbits.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,513
And he knows, we will assume, he knows

22
00:01:05,513 --> 00:01:06,991
how to build rabbit traps.

23
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,675
So now we are going to do a Production Possibilities Frontier,

24
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,442
not between rabbits and berries,

25
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:15,632
but between rabbits and building rabbit traps.

26
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:19,333
So rabbit traps. Rabbit traps.

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,327
So maybe some type of.. He is able to get twigs together

28
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,489
and you know...he builds something...

29
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,658
he puts the twigs together in a little thing.

30
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,368
You know, it's a little box.

31
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:29,324
That maybe he puts a little, I don't know,

32
00:01:29,324 --> 00:01:31,510
some type of carrot down over there.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,955
And then if the rabbit comes and takes the carrot,

34
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,223
then the box falls on the rabbit or something like that.

35
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:40,895
We do not have to go into the particulars of the actual trap.

36
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:44,525
But he can also spend his time building rabbit traps.

37
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:51,538
So let's say 1 rabbit trap, 2 rabbit traps and 3 rabbit traps.

38
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:54,741
And let's say that we are going to hold all other things equal.

39
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,575
Ceteris Paribus, so we are not worrying about other things.

40
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,670
And as we will see in most introductory economics classes,

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,265
whenever you do a Production Possibilities Frontier,

42
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,147
you are only doing it with 2 dimensions.

43
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,745
And so that's why you have a regular curve.

44
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,407
You could have one with 3 dimensions,

45
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,349
where you are doing a trade off between three things.

46
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,646
But then you'd have to have a 3 dimensional graph.

47
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:14,852
And essentially,

48
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,165
the Production Possibilities Frontier would be a surface.

49
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:19,023
But let's just focus on this right now.

50
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:22,298
Maybe I will do surface in the future just for fun.

51
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,142
So these are rabbit traps.

52
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:27,094
And let's say that the Production Possibilities Frontier

53
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,806
between the rabbit traps and rabbits

54
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:30,120
looks something like this.

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,469
He could spend all his time making rabbit traps

56
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,615
but in that case he won't get any rabbits and

57
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:39,000
he will probably starve and that wouldn't be a good scenario.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,576
Or he could spend all of his time hunting for rabbits

59
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:44,816
and he would catch on average 5 rabbits per day.

60
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,827
But that would leave him no time to make rabbit traps.

61
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:52,376
So this is our current Production Possibilities Frontier.

62
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:54,670
Let me just draw it.

63
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,835
This is our current Production Possibilities Frontier.

64
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:03,621
So I'll call this, 'P' - Production Possibilities Frontier.

65
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,336
And I will put a little zero subscript there.

66
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:07,851
That's our starting point.

67
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,822
So he could sit anywhere over here and

68
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,580
he would achieved productive efficiency

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,339
anywhere on this curve,

70
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:16,540
but as we saw if he just spent all of his time

71
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,267
if he just spent all of his time doing this over here

72
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,793
he will never get any rabbit traps and

73
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:22,763
so he won't be able to change

74
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:25,133
the Productive Possibility Frontier.

75
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:27,267
But what happens if instead

76
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,667
he decides that he does want to build rabbit traps?

77
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,267
So he decreases the number of rabbits a day to four.

78
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:36,727
And that allows him to make 1 rabbit trap per day.

79
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,501
So he wants to hang out in this scenario.

80
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,043
So every day that goes by,

81
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,035
on average he is going to make four rabbits

82
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:45,946
and he is going to build a rabbit trap.

83
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:47,410
So what's going to happen?

84
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,600
So as we go, maybe into the next period,

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,434
he would now have a rabbit trap after just one day

86
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,809
that he can use to help catch rabbits.

87
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:58,772
So that will actually change

88
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,288
the Production Possibilities Frontier.

89
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:05,333
So if he makes this investment, it will actually allow him

90
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,867
in a given amount of time to actually catch more rabbits.

91
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:12,333
So if he does that, the Production Possibilities Frontier..

92
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,823
Having a rabbit trap won't allow him

93
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,803
to make more rabbit traps in a day.

94
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:19,734
So the most rabbit traps he could make in a day

95
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,579
is still going to be 3.

96
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,139
But maybe now he can catch 6 rabbits a day.

97
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,400
So it might look something like that.

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,477
So now he could either stop making rabbit traps

99
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:35,791
and catch 6 a day, just with that one rabbit trap he has,

100
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,979
or he can continue, he can continue that

101
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,059
and now actually he can catch 5 rabbits a day

102
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,010
and still make 1 rabbit trap per day.

103
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,779
And maybe he decides to do that.

104
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,037
But it could be anywhere along

105
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,972
this Production Possibilities Frontier.

106
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:50,667
So he could say I am happy eating the 4 rabbits a day.

107
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:54,256
I am going to make 2 rabbit traps now everyday.

108
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:57,267
And now after another period he gets even more productive

109
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,733
and so then the production.

110
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,962
So let me call this one, this is after one day,

111
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:07,186
Production Possibilities Frontier after one day.

112
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,656
And then after two days

113
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:10,559
let's say he did this scenario right over here.

114
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,646
Now he's produced two rabbit traps. Obviously this is...

115
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,818
Maybe I am exaggerating

116
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,482
how quickly his productivity would grow.

117
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,144
But maybe now the new Production Possibilities Frontier

118
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,698
looks like, looks something like this.

119
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,187
He now has two rabbit traps.

120
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:26,941
So, or he may have two more rabbit traps.

121
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,048
He already had one.

122
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,016
So he now has three rabbit traps after two days.

123
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,271
And so now if he wanted to devote himself purely

124
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,947
to rabbit trapping, he could get 8 rabbits a day.

125
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:37,377
Or he could do some combination in between.

126
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,828
And actually this curve, this shouldn't go up at all.

127
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:40,913
I do not want to give you the impression that

128
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,588
it went up and then down. It just goes kind of straight,

129
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:46,213
does something like that right over here.

130
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:46,978
So this right over here,

131
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:51,698
I will call this Production Possibilities Frontier 2.

132
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:53,995
So what this hunter-gatherer is doing,

133
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,292
in this scenario right here is,

134
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:59,459
he is making an investment.

135
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,513
He is accumulating capital. This right over: this is capital.

136
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:09,933
He is choosing instead of to consume all of his resources.

137
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,393
So there's two things he can do,

138
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:14,579
he can either spend all of his time in pure consumption

139
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,119
getting as many rabbits as possible in a day and

140
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,642
then eating them all, pure consumption.

141
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:22,522
Or he could reduce his consumption and then

142
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:25,437
allocate some of his resources towards investment.

143
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:30,092
So this right over here, this is an investment.

144
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,085
It makes him more productive.

145
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,453
This right over here is consumption.

146
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:38,382
There is some base level of consumption he needs to survive

147
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:42,785
but if he invests, it increases his overall productive capacity.

148
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,600
So if you viewed him as an economy by himself,

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,133
by investing, instead of consuming all of his resources

150
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,357
by investing some of his resources and

151
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:53,733
in this case his resources are his time, his expertise.

152
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,708
By investing some of them,

153
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,684
he is able to increase his productivity.

154
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,933
And if you viewed him as an economy,

155
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:05,425
he is experiencing ... Economic Growth.

156
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,195
And so there are multiple types of investment and

157
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,017
we will talk about these in multiple videos.

158
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:13,965
In this case, he is doing Capital Accumulation.

159
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,651
He is building tools that will make him more productive.

160
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:19,851
Another type of investment, is essentially

161
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,090
Technological Change, Technological Improvement,

162
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,308
which will would actually make his tools even better.

163
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:25,965
So he could have a..

164
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:28,529
We can maybe draw another Production Possibilities Frontier

165
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,782
between making rabbit traps and

166
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:34,927
then doing R&D on inventing new types of rabbit traps.

167
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:35,671
So he could decide on

168
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,175
which of those two things he wants to decide between.

169
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,230
But what I wanted you to just appreciate in this video is that,

170
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,667
the Production Possibilities Frontier can change.

171
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:46,224
You can become more productive

172
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:50,484
if you do have investment in R&D or Capital Accumulation.

173
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:54,592
And in this case that just happened to be Rabbit Traps.
