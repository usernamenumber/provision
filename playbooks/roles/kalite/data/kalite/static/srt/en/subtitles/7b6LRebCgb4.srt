1
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:06,411
Okay let's talk about the arteries and the veins

2
00:00:06,411 --> 00:00:09,536
and I'm actually going to talk about the both of them

3
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:11,980
and simultaneously because there are some interesting

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,139
differences I want to point out between the two. You know that they're both vessels but

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,185
there are some really important differences between how they work and what they do.

6
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:24,305
So this is your heart and coming out of your heart is the aorta

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:27,902
and before this video I have been drawing the aorta quite differently,

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:32,985
kind of showing its branches and here I am showing it kind of stretched out.

9
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:39,278
and I'll show a few of the branches but really the point of the drawing is not to make it anatomically correct,

10
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:41,550
you can tell that definitely it's not anatomically correct,

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,097
because that wouldn't make any sense at all,

12
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:45,548
that blood going off to one side.

13
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:48,815
But really, I want to show you a concept in this video.

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:52,912
A few concepts, actually. So, here we have --let's say, the vein.

15
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:56,212
And I'm gonna stretch that out as well, and let's imagine that

16
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:00,760
all of the veins are dumping into this one final vein.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,780
It gets back to the --to the heart.

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,774
So I'll draw the branches kind of coming in to the vein here and here.

19
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:14,586
And we know that the arteries and the vein are trying to get blood out to the capillaries.

20
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:19,302
So these show you what a zoomed in version may look like of the capillaries.

21
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:25,518
So we've got --let's say, some capillaries, 
here and maybe some here and here.

22
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:29,208
And you know of course in real life you don't have three such a capillary beds,

23
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,487
which is what I'm drawing here, but really of thousands and thousands, right?

24
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:36,298
And let's not to forget, you know,

25
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:39,104
these capillaries are basically found in different parts in the body,

26
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:43,215
so you might have --for example, a bone, and some capillaries in the bone,

27
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:46,211
you may have this second capillary, may be, going to your face,

28
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:49,191
let's say even specifically, your nose.

29
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:54,138
And this third capillary bed, may be going down to your foot.

30
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:58,013
So you have blood in your foot.

31
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:02,616
So you have different parts of the body all getting capillaries and

32
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:08,420
the blood is gonna start at the heart, go to the capillaries through the arteries,

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,882
and then return through all those beds.

34
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:12,213
And we've kind of lumped it together.

35
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:18,726
And what I want to show you now is, that these very very simply is the systemic circulation.

36
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:20,743
Systemic circulation.

37
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:25,947
Now, of course you know that there is also the pulmonary circulation.

38
00:02:25,947 --> 00:02:27,215
So what is that look like?

39
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,355
I mean to draw that here --pulmonary circulation.

40
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,082
So pulmonary, you know, means lungs.

41
00:02:32,082 --> 00:02:40,894
And I've shown you previously, in another video, that there is blood going to these lungs.

42
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:48,531
In a very low pressure system. So we talked previously about low pressure and high pressure system.

43
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,636
And now I just remember that this is kind of how it gets there,

44
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:55,854
you have deoxygenated blood, or the --the blood in the blue vessel,

45
00:02:55,854 --> 00:03:01,515
kind of going up like that, and this should be the pulmonary artery.

46
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,881
Pulmonary artery.

47
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:09,625
All right, {Art.} for artery. And we have the pulmonary vein,

48
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:15,739
bringing that blood back to the heart with oxygen in it.

49
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,014
Pulmonary vein.

50
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:23,713
So that's your pulmonary circulation, so your pulmonary circulation in your systemic circulation.

51
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:28,377
And I'll get back to why I drew the pulmonary artery in blue,

52
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:31,613
and pulmonary vein in red, in just one second.

53
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,331
Let's put that on the side for a momment.

54
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:38,243
And let's get into exactly how to think about arteries and veins in general.

55
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:44,317
So in general, I think of arteries as taking blood {AWAY} from the heart.

56
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:49,533
That's the easiest and most clear way of figuring out what an artery is exactly.

57
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,679
So, arteries are taking blood AWAY from the heart.

58
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,811
So let me just draw a little arrow here.

59
00:03:55,811 --> 00:04:02,315
And veins are bringing blood {BACK}. And so this becomes our first point.

60
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:06,652
Point number one, and this's the point of difference between the two of them,

61
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:10,206
is the direction of flowing, and even if you see at pulmonary system,

62
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:14,679
you can see that --that remains true, that the arteries are taking blood away,

63
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,478
and the vein is bringing the blood back.

64
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,670
Okay. Point number two. Now you see that the arteries are drawn in red, for the most part.

65
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,237
And so usually arteries have oxygenated blood, that they're bringing out to the tissues.

66
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:32,901
And then the veins carry the deoxygenated blood, that they bring back from the tissue.

67
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,842
So point number two, is really about the colour.

68
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,570
And so we write that in here.

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:44,184
So this should be like a little red blood cell with hemoglobin in it.

70
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:47,680
And this is a little red blood cells --

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,881
still called the red blood cell eventhough its colour is more blue,

72
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:53,091
but it still got the hemoglobin in it,

73
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:58,953
but the hemoglobin down here --down here, actually doesn't have any oxygen left,

74
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:01,312
and so the colour looks quite different.

75
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:08,948
So the colour of arterial blood is usually red, because of the fact that oxygen is bound to the hemoglobin.

76
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:13,348
And less oxygen bound in the venous side, so that's why it turns blue.

77
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:17,945
Now, I want to --just a little star there, because that's not always true.

78
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:22,215
And you can see where clearly it's not true, it's over here.

79
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,911
So I'd like to --let me star the pulmonary circulation,

80
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,993
where you can see that the pulmonary artery and vein --I'll star that,

81
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:32,724
that's just really emphasize the point, or actually the reverse of what I've just said, right.

82
00:05:32,724 --> 00:05:36,693
Because the pulmonary artery is actually gonna carry deoxygenated blood,

83
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:39,084
and the pulmonary vein is carrying oxygenated blood.

84
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,305
So clearly that's the reverse of what I've just said.

85
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:44,446
But that is one exception to the general rule,

86
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:49,031
which is that arteries definitely look red, and veins generally look blue.

87
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,513
Okay, so that --those are two points of difference between the arteries and veins.

88
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:58,988
Let's keep going. So now you know, that arteries are high pressure, right.

89
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:03,801
because the heart is pumping the blood out, and it's gonna be in a very very high pressure.

90
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:09,519
And so I kind of think the arteries as being like a river, a fast flowing river.

91
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,558
So you can think of this as fast flowing, high pressure.

92
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:21,684
So that is the third difference. This is a high pressure system.

93
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:23,712
Third difference, it's that it's high pressure system.

94
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:29,235
In fact, maybe I'll even emphasize the point by writing the word very large:

95
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:32,481
HIGH PRESSURE.

96
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:39,412
And actually, the other thing we think about with these arteries is that there is not so much volume in the arteries.

97
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,912
So if you actually look at --let's say, first time now,

98
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:44,430
you should try figure out where all the blood was located,

99
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,239
not too much of it is in the arteries.

100
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:52,043
So it's very low volume system, right, its volume is very small.

101
00:06:52,043 --> 00:07:01,843
And the veins are the opposite. They're kind of a large volume-- system.

102
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:04,006
And they have really kind of a low pressure.

103
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,572
Alright, pressure is very small over here.

104
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:09,403
And if you actually figure out what percent is where,

105
00:07:09,414 --> 00:07:13,983
in terms of the amount of blood, about 5% of the blood, at any point time,

106
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:18,264
would be in the heart. And --let's say, about 5% would be in the capillaries.

107
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:24,183
and then about 10% or so, would be in the lungs.

108
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:29,071
So what we have to --now we're 5 and 5 is 10, 10 plus 10 is 20.

109
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:36,072
And then we have another about 15% in the arteries. So about 15%.

110
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,801
So that's actually not too much blood.

111
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:46,245
And so the remaining --what is that, 65% of the blood, is actually in the vein, in any point of time.

112
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:53,594
So that's remarkable, right. About two third of the blood in any point time is actually sitting in all the vein combined.

113
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,618
And so the way I've drawn it, isn't really --not really a best way to draw it.

114
00:07:56,618 --> 00:08:02,780
I should really erase this. And really redraw this to make it much more accurate.

115
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,993
It should look a lot more like this, right, like a big giant lake of blood.

116
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,141
And so this is actually how to think about of the vein.

117
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:16,841
It's actually very very low pressure but high volume system.

118
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:23,111
So that may be the third point. I'll bring up on the blood side --or, on the vein side.

119
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:29,520
it's that it's a high volume system. so, high volume.

120
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,041
Now, we've talked about the direction of flow,

121
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:36,484
we've talked about the fact that one side carries more oxygen than the other,

122
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:41,893
and we've also talked about the fact that arteries are high pressure-low volume system.

123
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,513
And the veins are high volume-low pressure system.

124
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:47,094
So what are some other differences?

125
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:54,334
So, one other difference is that in the arteries, you actually don't have any valves.

126
00:08:54,334 --> 00:09:00,586
Now --I don't know how to label that to make it super clear, but let me just find some sort open spot here,

127
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:03,684
and write number four, there're no valves in the arterial system,

128
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:07,572
whereas on the venous side, you actually do have valves.

129
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:15,997
You have these valves come together --we make it very clear, but making the two sides touch.

130
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,372
And the blood kind of goes through like that.

131
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:24,144
So you have these valves keep the blood going in the right direction.

132
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:27,612
So that would be the fourth point of difference between the two.

133
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:30,645
So you have these valves. And you might get confused, because you think,

134
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,422
"well, doesn't the heart also have valves?"

135
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,586
And it does, the heart also has valves.

136
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:40,173
But the veins have a different type of valves, and that's actually keep the blood flowing in the right direction.

137
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:43,127
You can imagine that you probably don't even need that on the arterial side,

138
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:47,217
because the pressures are so high, that the blood is forced to go one way.

139
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:50,593
Or, it's in the vein, because it's kind of a giant lake.

140
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:54,249
Water can kind of swirl around and around and around,

141
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:58,257
and so it's helpful to have valves keeping going in the right direction.

142
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,157
So that's the fourth point of difference.

143
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:03,998
So now think about of the fact that you might have, a break in the arterial system.

144
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:11,456
So let's say that you have an accident, and you cut an artery --or, a big artery, let's say.

145
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:13,219
What would it look like? So if you have a break right here,

146
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:18,449
you would actually have like a fountain of blood, coming out, right there.

147
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:24,572
Because it's under such high pressure, it's gonna spew up, right.

148
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:27,993
And so this is basically what it looks like when you actually cut your artery,

149
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:32,160
again, because of the fact that it's under such high pressure.

150
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,914
And on the venous side, on the vein side, if you have a break. It looks really different.

151
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:40,344
Because you have --let's say your break is right here,

152
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:45,243
you'd actually get a kind of --a pool of blood, just locally, before it clots off.

153
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:51,963
Because again, you have a very low pressure. So it's just gonna kind of quietly pool and,

154
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:54,798
you might get a bruise right there.

155
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:57,600
But it's really won't look like a fountain of blood.

156
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,740
And that's actually another final point of difference which,

157
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,167
really gets back to the high pressure system on the arterial side,

158
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:08,381
and the high volume-low pressure system on the venous side.

159
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,965
