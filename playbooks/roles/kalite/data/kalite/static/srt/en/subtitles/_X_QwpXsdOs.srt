1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,980
Now I think is a good time
to add some notation and

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,560
techniques to our Laplace
Transform tool kit.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,430
So the first thing I want to
introduce is just kind of a

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,270
quick way of doing something.

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,490
And that is, if I had the
Laplace Transform, let's say I

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,540
want to take the Laplace
Transform of the second

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,540
derivative of y.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,690
Well, we proved several videos
ago that if I wanted to take

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:30,830
the Laplace Transform of the
first derivative of y, that is

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:41,060
equal to s times the Laplace
Transform of y minus y of 0.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,970
And we used this property in the
last couple of videos to

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,170
actually figure out the Laplace
Transform of the

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,630
second derivative.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,780
Because if you just, you know,
if you say this is y prime,

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,640
this is the anti-derivative
of it, then you could just

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,260
pattern match.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,220
You could say, well, the Laplace
Transform of y prime

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,050
prime, that's just equal to s
times the Laplace Transform of

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,800
y prime minus y prime of 0.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,960
This is the derivative of this,
just like this is the

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,430
derivative of this.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,900
I'll draw a line here just so
you don't get confused.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,410
So the Laplace Transform of y
prime prime is this thing.

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,580
And now we can use this, which
we proved several videos ago,

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,740
to resubstitute it and get it
in terms of the Laplace

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,120
Transform of y.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,470
So we can expand this part.

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,800
The Laplace Transform of the
derivative of y, that's just

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:39,770
equal to s times the Laplace
Transform of y minus y of 0.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,370
And then we have the
outside, right?

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,290
We have s minus y prime of 0.

33
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,180
And then when you expand it all
out, and we've done this

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,700
before, you get s squared times
the Laplace Transform of

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,550
y minus s times y of 0
minus y prime of 0.

36
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,170
Now there's something
interesting to note here, and

37
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,300
if you learn this it'll
make it a lot faster.

38
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,250
You won't have to go through
all of this and risk making

39
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,980
careless mistakes when you have
scarce time and paper on

40
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,050
your test. Just notice that
when you take the Laplace

41
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,400
Transform of the second
derivative, what do we end up?

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,150
We end up with s
squared, right?

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,940
This was the second
derivative.

44
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,600
So I end up with s squared times
the Laplace Transform of

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,420
y, minus s times y of 0 minus
1 times y prime of 0.

46
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,710
So every term, we started with s
squared, and then every term

47
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,590
we lower the degree of s one,
and then everything except the

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,370
first term is a negative sign.

49
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,830
And then we started with the
Laplace Transform of y, and

50
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,360
then you can almost view the
Laplace Transform as a kind of

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,390
integral, so we kind of take
the derivatives, so

52
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,700
then you get y.

53
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,550
And then you take
the derivative

54
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,810
again, you get y prime.

55
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,380
And of course every other
term is negative.

56
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,790
And these aren't the
actual functions.

57
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,600
These are those functions
evaluated at 0.

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,710
But that's a good way to help
you, hopefully, remember how

59
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,250
to do these.

60
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,000
And once you get the hang of it,
you can take the Laplace

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,260
Transform of any arbitrary
function very, very quickly.

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,640
Or any arbitrary derivatives.

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,550
So let's say we wanted to take
the Laplace Transform of, I

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,950
don't know, this should hit
the point home, the fourth

65
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,290
derivative of y.

66
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,380
That 4 in parentheses means
the fourth derivative.

67
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,450
I could have drawn four prime
marks, but either way.

68
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,430
So what is this equal to?

69
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,620
If we use this technique and
substitute it, we're bound to

70
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,130
make some form of careless
mistake or other, and it would

71
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,040
take us forever and it would
waste a lot of paper.

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,940
But now we see the pattern, and
so we can just say, well,

73
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,540
the Laplace Transform of this,
in terms of the Laplace

74
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,020
Transform of y, right, that's
what we want to get to, is

75
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:48,250
going to be s to the fourth
times the Laplace Transform of

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,160
y-- now every other term is
going to have a minus in front

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,600
of it-- minus-- lower the
degree on the s--

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,880
minus s to the third.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,060
And then you could kind of say,
let's take the, you know,

80
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,210
so form of derivative, so you
get y of 0-- it's not a real

81
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:06,480
derivative.

82
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,215
The Laplace Transform really
isn't the anti-derivative of y

83
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,500
of 0, but anyway, I think
you get the idea.

84
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,260
And then we lower the degree on
s again, minus s squared,

85
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,450
take the derivative.

86
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,820
And of course these
aren't functions.

87
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,350
But we're evaluating the
derivative of that

88
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,110
function now of 0.

89
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,350
So y prime of 0, minus-- now we
lower the degree one more--

90
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:37,450
minus s, times-- this is an s--
times y prime prime of 0.

91
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,670
We have one more term.

92
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,520
Lower the degree on the
s one more time.

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,980
Then you get s to the
0, which is just 1.

94
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,560
So minus-- and 1 is a
coefficient-- and then you

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,281
have y, the third derivative
of y-- let me scroll over a

96
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:52,330
little bit-- the third
derivative of y

97
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,430
evaluated at 0.

98
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,860
So I think you see
the pattern now.

99
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,460
And this is a much faster way
of evaluating the Laplace

100
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,990
Transform of an arbitrary
derivative of y, as opposed to

101
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,090
keep going through that pattern
over and over again.

102
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,500
Another thing I want to
introduce you to is just a

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,850
notational savings.

104
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,990
And it's just something that
you'll see, so you might as

105
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,330
well get used to it.

106
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,790
And it actually saves time over,
you know, keep writing

107
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,820
this curly L in this bracket.

108
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:27,110
If I have the Laplace Transform
of y of t, I can

109
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,330
write as, and people tend to
write it as-- well, it's going

110
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,000
to be a function of s, and what
they use is a capital Y

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,720
to denote the function of s.

112
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
   

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,910
It makes sense, because normally
when we're doing

114
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,880
antiderivatives, you just take--
you know, when you

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,660
learn the fundamental theorem
of calculus, you learn that

116
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,620
the integral of f with respect
to dx, you know, from 0 to x,

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,580
is equal to capital F of x.

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,080
So it's kind of borrowing that
notation, because this

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,550
function of s is kind of
an integral of y of t.

120
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,210
The Laplace Transform, to some
degree, is like a special type

121
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,210
of integral where you have a
little exponential function in

122
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,800
there to mess around with
things a little bit.

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,830
Anyway, I just wanted you to
get used to this notation.

124
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,410
When you see capital Y of s,
that's the same thing as a

125
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,190
Laplace Transform of y of t.

126
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,820
And you might also
see it this way.

127
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:36,250
The Laplace Transform of f of t
is equal to capital F of s.

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,140
And the clue that tells you that
this isn't just a normal

129
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,950
antiderivative, is the fact that
they're using that s as

130
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,110
the independent variable.

131
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,620
Because in general, s represents
the frequency

132
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,250
domain, and if people were to
use s with just a general

133
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,350
antiderivative, people
would get confused,

134
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,350
et cetera, et cetera.

135
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,520
Anyway, I'm trying to think
whether I have time to teach

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,480
you more fascinating concepts
of Laplace Transform.

137
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,260
Well, sure, I think we do.

138
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,586
So my next question for you--
and now we'll teach you a

139
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,660
couple more properties, and
this'll be helpful in taking

140
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,750
Laplace Transforms. What is the
Laplace Transform of e to

141
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,160
the at times f of t?

142
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,170
Fascinating.

143
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,140
Well, let's just should go back
to our definition of the

144
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,700
Laplace Transform.

145
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,880
It is the integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus st

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,310
times whatever we have between
the curly brackets.

147
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:43,980
So, with the curly brackets we
have e to the at f of t dt.

148
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,550
And now we can add
these exponents.

149
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,630
We have a similar base, so
this is equal to what?

150
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:53,660
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

151
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,440
And let's see, I want to write
it as, I could write it minus

152
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,680
s plus a, but I'm going to write
it as minus s minus a t.

153
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,790
And you could expand this out.

154
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,490
It becomes minus s plus a, which
is exactly what we have

155
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,280
here, times f of t dt.

156
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,190
Now let me show you something.

157
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:24,300
if I were to just take the
Laplace Transform of f of t,

158
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,320
that is equal to some
function of s.

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,400
   

160
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,390
Whatever we essentially have
right here for s, it becomes

161
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,440
some function of that.

162
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,900
So this is interesting.

163
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,820
This is some function of s.

164
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,309
Here, all we did to go
from-- well actually

165
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,080
let me rewrite this.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,590
The Laplace, which is equal to
0 to infinity e to the minus

167
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,380
st f of t dt.

168
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,640
The Laplace Transform of just f
of t is equal to this, which

169
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,260
is some function of s.

170
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,200
Well, the Laplace Transform of
e to the at, times f of t, it

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,800
equals this.

172
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,510
And what's the difference
between this and this?

173
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,770
What's the difference
between the two?

174
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,910
Well, it's not much.

175
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:19,430
Here, wherever I have an s,
I have an s minus a here.

176
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,350
So if this is a function of s,
what's this going to be?

177
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,150
It's going to be that
same function.

178
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,220
Whatever the Laplace Transform
of f was, it's going to be

179
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,450
that same function, but instead
of s, it's going to be

180
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,510
a function of s minus a.

181
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,540
And once again, how
did I get that?

182
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,200
Well I said the Laplace
Transform of f is a function

183
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,940
of s, and it's equal to this.

184
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,420
Well if I just replace an s with
an s minus a, I get this,

185
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,390
which is a function
of s minus a.

186
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,680
Which was the Laplace Transform
of e to the

187
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,490
at times f of t.

188
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,360
Maybe that's a little
confusing.

189
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,920
Let me show you an example.

190
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:03,390
Let's just take the Laplace
Transform of cosine of 2t.

191
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:08,720
We've shown is equal to-- well
I'll write the notation-- it's

192
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,865
equal to some function of s.

193
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:15,110
And that function of s is
s over s squared plus 4.

194
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,940
We've shown that already.

195
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:25,120
And so the Laplace Transform of
e to the, I don't know, 3t

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,820
times cosine of 2t, is going
to be equal to the same

197
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,970
function, but instead of
s, it's going to be a

198
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,760
function of s minus a.

199
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:46,170
So s minus 3, which is equal
to s minus 3 over s minus 3

200
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,220
squared plus 4.

201
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,320
Notice, when you just multiply
something by this, either the

202
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,230
3t and then or either the at,
you take the Laplace Transform

203
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,690
of it, you just-- it's the
same thing as the Laplace

204
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,010
Transform of this function, but
everywhere where you had

205
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,840
an s, you replace it with
an s minus this a.

206
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,870
Anyway, I hope I didn't
confuse you too much

207
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,600
with that last part.

208
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,970
I think my power adaptor
actually just went on.

209
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,210
I hope the video keeps
recording.

210
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,540
I'll see you in the next one.
