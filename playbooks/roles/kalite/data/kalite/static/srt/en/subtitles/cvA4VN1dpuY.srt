1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's do another conic section
identification problem.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:14,780
So, I have 4y squared
minus 50x is equal to 25x

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,950
squared plus 16y plus 109.

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,450
So, the first thing I like to
do is to group all of the x and

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,740
y terms onto one side of the
equation and leave all the

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,350
constants on the other side.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's do that.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,110
So, on the left-hand side
I'll put the 4y squared.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,190
4yy squared.

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,360
And, actually, I'm also going
to group all the x and

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,560
y terms in this step.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,660
So the 4y squared.

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,110
Let's move this 16y onto
the left-hand side.

15
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,840
So if I subtract 16y from both
sides of this equation, I get

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,225
minus 16y, minus 16y on the
left-hand side and of course

17
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,930
it will disappear on
the right-hand side.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,260
And then I want to subtract
the 25x squared from both

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,020
sides of this equation.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:08,710
So I get minus 25x
squared minus 50x.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,940
That's that right there.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,340
And then I'll leave this 109
on the right-hand side.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,220
It's equal to 109.

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,696
And now that we have the x's
and the y's on the same side of

25
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:20,440
the equation, we know what type
of -- we know the general

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,490
direction we're going to go in.

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,880
Because they're on
the same side.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,900
They have different
coefficients.

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,930
And one is positive
and one is negative.

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,120
So that lets us know that we're
dealing with a hyperbola.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,690
So let's complete the
square and get it into

32
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,740
the standard form.

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,990
So, the easiest way to complete
the square is if you have a 1

34
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,530
coefficient on the y squared
and the x squared terms.

35
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,520
So let's factor out
a 4, in this case.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,530
So you get 4 times y
squared minus 4y.

37
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,100
I'm going to add
something later, when

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,670
I complete the square.

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:58,990
Minus 25 times x squared,
plus, let's see, minus 50

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,190
divided by minus 25 is 2.

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,400
Plus 2x, I'm going to
add something later.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,550
Is equal to 109.

43
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,500
And the things we're going
to add, those are what

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,340
complete the square.

45
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,770
Make these things
a perfect square.

46
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,000
So, if I take this, you
have a minus 4 here.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,210
I take half of that number.

48
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,980
This is just completing the
square, I encourage you to

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,550
watch the video on completing
the square where I

50
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,760
explain why this works.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,230
But I think I have a minus 4.

52
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,570
I take half of that,
it's minus 2.

53
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,010
And then minus 2
squared is plus 4.

54
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,970
Now, I can't do one thing to
one side of the equation

55
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,220
without doing it to the other.

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,585
And I didn't add a 4 to the
left-hand side of the equation.

57
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,660
I actually added a
4 times 4, right?

58
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,990
Because you have this 4
multiplying it out front.

59
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,965
So I added at 16 to the left
side of the equation, so I

60
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:46,390
have to also add it to
the right-hand side

61
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,740
of the equation.

62
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:47,980
Right?

63
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,720
This is equivalent to also
having a plus 16 here.

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,050
That might make a little
bit clearer, right?

65
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,340
When you factor it out,
and it becomes a 4.

66
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,090
And we would have added
a 16 up here as well.

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,930
Likewise, if we take half
of this number here.

68
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,020
Half of 2 is 1.

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,780
1 squared is 1.

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,990
We didn't add a 1 to the
left-hand side of the equation,

71
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,860
we added a 1 times minus 25.

72
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,180
So we want to put
a minus 25 here.

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,630
And, likewise, this would
have been the same thing as

74
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,560
adding a minus 25 up here.

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,170
And you do a minus
25 over here.

76
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,780
And now, what does this become?

77
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,420
The y terms become 4
times y minus 2 squared.

78
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,580
y minus 2 squared.

79
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,740
Might want to review factoring
a polynomial, if you found that

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,090
a little confusing, that step.

81
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,740
Minus 25 times x
plus 1 squared.

82
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,170
That's that, right there.

83
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,620
x plus 1 squared, is equal to,
let's see, 109 plus 16 is

84
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,140
25 minus 25, it equals 100.

85
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,000
We're almost there.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,130
So we want a 1 here, so
let's divide both sides

87
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,020
of this equation by 100.

88
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,470
So, you will get y
minus 2 squared.

89
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,910
4 divided by 100 is the
same thing as 1/25, so

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,490
this becomes over 25.

91
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,160
Minus, let's see, 25/100 is the
same thing as 1/4, so this

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,620
becomes x plus 1 squared
over 4 is equal to 1.

93
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,390
And there you have it.

94
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,480
We have it in standard
form and, yes, indeed,

95
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,470
we do have a hyperbola.

96
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,780
Now, let's graph
this hyperbola.

97
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,600
So the first thing we
know is where the center

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,410
of this hyperbola is.

99
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,020
Is the center of this hyperbola
is at the point x is

100
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,080
equal to minus one.

101
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,340
So it's an x is equal to
minus 1. y is equal to 2.

102
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,340
And let's figure out the
asymptotes of this hyperbola.

103
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,240
So if this was -- this is the
way I always do it, because I

104
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,090
always forget the
actual formula.

105
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,200
If this was centered at 0 and
it looked something like this.

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,020
y squared over 25 minus x
squared over 4 is equal to 1.

107
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,460
I do this to figure out what
the asymptotes would have been

108
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,570
if we were centered at 0.

109
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,560
Because it's a lot easier to
deal with these equations

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,690
than to deal with these.

111
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,370
So we could solve -- we
multiply both sides by 100.

112
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,590
We're kind of unwinding
what we just did.

113
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:24,070
So if you -- actually, let's
multiply both sides by 25.

114
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,670
So then you get y squared
minus 2 over 4x squared

115
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,490
is equal to 25.

116
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,130
And then, I'll just
go right here.

117
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,390
And then if I add 25 over 4x
squared to both sides, I get

118
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:49,090
y squared is equal to 25
over 4x squared plus 25.

119
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,970
And so, y is equal to the plus
or minus square root of 25

120
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,800
over 4x squared plus 25.

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,350
And like always, the
asymptotes, the hyperbola will

122
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,410
never equal the asymptotes or
intersect the asymptotes, but

123
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,740
it's what the graph approaches
as x approaches positive

124
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,950
and negative infinity.

125
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,570
So, as x approaches positive
and negative infinity, and

126
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,490
you'll learn the concept
of limits later on.

127
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,320
But I think you get
it at this point.

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,220
Because that's what the idea
of an asymptote even is.

129
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,195
Is that as x gets really
larger, approaching this line

130
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:29,800
-- so as x approaches positive
or negative infinity, as we've

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,840
done in the previous videos,
this term starts to

132
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,180
matter a lot less.

133
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,610
Because this term is huge.

134
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,630
So then y is approximately
equal to plus or minus the

135
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,990
square root of just this term.

136
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,370
Now, the square root of
just this term is 5/2 x.

137
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,640
So those would be our
asymptotes if we

138
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,430
were centered at 0.

139
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,710
But, of course, we're
centered at negative 1, 2.

140
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,030
So let's graph that.

141
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,350
And then we could figure out
if it's a upward-opening

142
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:02,660
or downward-opening graph.

143
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,580
We're centered at
negative 1, 2.

144
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,950
   

145
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,826
So I want to be in the,
that's my y axis.

146
00:07:13,826 --> 00:07:16,970
This is my x axis.

147
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:24,830
And we're centered
at minus 1, 1, 2.

148
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,585
That's the center.

149
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:31,470
And this would've been the
two lines of the asymptotes

150
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,870
if we were centered at 0.

151
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,750
But now this tells us the
slope of the two asymptotes.

152
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,160
So the asymptotes are going to
intersect at the center of

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,940
our hyperbola, so to speak.

154
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,540
So these are the slopes
of the two asymptotes.

155
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,030
And one is positive 5/2.

156
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,510
So, positive 5/2 means
if we go over 2, so 1,

157
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,260
2, in x, we go up 5.

158
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,970
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

159
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,930
So we'll end up
right over there.

160
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,120
So I can draw that line, I just
need two points for a line.

161
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,470
So that line would
look like that.

162
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,850
And the other asymptote
is minus 5/2.

163
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,110
So for every 2 we go over to
the right, we go down 5.

164
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,230
So, 1, 2.

165
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,820
1, 2, 3 4, 5.

166
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,800
So we end up right about there.

167
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,680
And so that line would
look like that.

168
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,170
Good enough.

169
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,130
So those are the two
asymptotes, and they go on

170
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,030
forever in those directions.

171
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,460
And now we can think
of it two ways.

172
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,190
We could either say, OK, if
we look at -- actually,

173
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,670
look at this one.

174
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,230
If it was centered at
0, could x equals 0?

175
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,370
Well, sure x could equal 0.

176
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,620
If x is 0, then y squared
over 25 equals 1. y

177
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,560
squared equals 25.

178
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,850
y would be plus or minus 5.

179
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,590
So, in this case, this
term could be equal to 0.

180
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,165
So we could say that x
could equal negative 1.

181
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:06,050
If x is equal to negative 1,
then y minus 2 squared over 25

182
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,610
will equal -- let's do that.

183
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,570
Let's set.

184
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:16,430
If x is equal to negative 1,
x is equal to negative 1,

185
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,510
then what does this
expression become?

186
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,530
I don't want to lose it, so
I'll write it right there.

187
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:27,080
So then you get y minus
2 squared over 25.

188
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,770
This becomes 0 minus
0 is equal to 1.

189
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,520
So you get y minus 2 squared
over 25 is equal to 1.

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,430
y minus 2 squared
is equal to 25.

191
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,140
Just multiplied
both sides by 25.

192
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,310
y minus 2 is equal to plus or
minus, I'm just taking the

193
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,790
square root of both sides, 5.

194
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,590
So y minus 2 is equal to
positive 5 or y minus

195
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,470
2 is equal to minus 5.

196
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,330
Add 2 to both sides of this,
you get y is equal to 7.

197
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,530
Add 2 to both sides of this,
you get y is equal to minus 3.

198
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:13,880
So we know that the points
minus 1, 7 and minus 1, minus

199
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,350
3, are both on this graph.

200
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,090
So, minus 1 is here.

201
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:26,410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, minus
1, 7, and minus 1, 1, 2,

202
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,660
3, are both on this graph.

203
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,610
So that lets us know, since
we're inside here, this tells

204
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,830
us that this is kind of a
vertical asymptote, and another

205
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,580
way to guess it is, if you
see that y squared

206
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,770
term is positive.

207
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,200
Or the other way to think about
it is, when you take the

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,460
positive square root, when you
take the positive square root,

209
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,210
you're always going to be a
little bit above the asymptote.

210
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,730
That's the other way
to think about this.

211
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,470
That we're always going to be
a little bit -- and this is

212
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,780
the positive square root.

213
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,860
The positive square
root is the top line.

214
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,480
So we're always going to be a
little bit above the asymptote.

215
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,150
This is the asymptote.

216
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,870
But we're always a
little bit above it.

217
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,370
And obviously as this number
gets larger, this starts to

218
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,080
matter a lot less, so the
graph is going to look

219
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,740
something like this.

220
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,870
It's going to come down and
then go off, and never quite

221
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,220
touch the asymptote,
but approach it.

222
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,770
So it's going to get really
close to the asymptote, and

223
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,030
then go off, and go off
in that direction.

224
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,970
Anyway, hope you
found that helpful.

225
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,480
This was a slightly hairier
problem, so it should

226
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,050
be instructive.

227
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,647
