1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,390
Let's try some little more
complicated equations.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:13,340
Let's say we have 3 times
x plus 5-- I want to make

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:27,593
sure I get all the colors
nice-- is equal to 17.

4
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,817
So what's different about this
than what we saw in the last

5
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:32,290
video is, all of a sudden,
now we have this plus 5.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,250
If it was just 3x is equal to
17, you could divide both

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,570
sides by 3, and you'd
get your answer.

8
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,080
But now this 5 seems to mess
things up a little bit.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,610
Now, before we even solve
it, let's think about

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,170
what it's saying.

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,500
Let's solve it kind of in a
tangible way, then we'll solve

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,800
it using operations that
hopefully will make

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,650
sense after that.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,440
So 3 times x literally means--
so let me write it over here.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,870
So we have 3 times x.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,960
So we literally have an
x plus an x plus an x.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,630
That right there is a 3x.

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,170
And then that's plus 5, and
I'm actually going to write

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,770
it out as five objects.

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,130
So plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

21
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:19,395
This right here, this 3x
plus 5, is equal to 17.

22
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,818
So let me write the equal sign.

23
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,807
Now, let me draw
17 objects here.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:38,020
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,910
Now, these two things are
equal, so anything you do

26
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,440
to this side, you have
to do to that side.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,460
If we were to get rid of one
object here, you'd want to get

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,730
rid of one object there in
order for the equality

29
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,730
to still be true.

30
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,530
Now, what can we do to both
sides of this equation so we

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,690
can get it in the form that
we're used to, where we

32
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,040
only have a 3x on the
left-hand side, where

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,840
we don't have this 5?

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,810
Well, ideally, we would
just get rid of these

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,210
five objects here.

36
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,460
You would literally get rid
of these five objects:

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,710
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,300
But, like I said, if the
original thing was equal to the

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,410
original thing on the right, if
we get rid of five objects from

40
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,680
the left-hand side, we have
to get rid of five objects

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,900
from the right-hand side.

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,600
So we have to do it here,
too: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,030
Now, what is a symbolic way
of representing taking

44
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,800
away five things?

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,550
Well, you're subtracting 5 from
both sides of this equation.

46
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,100
So that's what we're doing here
when we took away 5 from the

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,410
left and from the right.

48
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,660
So we're subtracting
5 from the left.

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,820
That's what we did here.

50
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,800
And we're also subtracting
5 from the right.

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,390
Do that right over there.

52
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,790
Now, what does the left-hand
side of the equation

53
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,220
now become?

54
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,300
The left-hand side,
you have 5 minus 5.

55
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,170
These cancel out.

56
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,800
You're just left with the 3x.

57
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:54,531
It's a different
shade of green.

58
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:58,930
You are just left with the 3x.

59
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,260
The 5 and the negative
5 canceled out.

60
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,300
And you see that here.

61
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,070
When you got rid of these
five objects, we were

62
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,410
just left with the 3x's.

63
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,340
This right here is the 3x.

64
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,490
And the whole reason why we
subtracted 5 is because we

65
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,780
wanted this 5 to go away.

66
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,790
Now, what does the right-hand
side of the equation look like?

67
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,450
So it's 3x is going to be-- let
me write the equality sign

68
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,210
right under it-- is equal to--
or you could either just

69
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,060
do it mathematically.

70
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,980
Say, OK, 17 minus 5.

71
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,310
17 minus 5 is 12.

72
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,120
Or you could just
count over here.

73
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,910
I had 17 things.

74
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,900
I took away 5.

75
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,800
I have 12 left: 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

76
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,090
That's what's subtraction is.

77
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,180
It's just taking
away five things.

78
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,820
So now we have it in a pretty
straightforward form.

79
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,350
3x is equal to 12.

80
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,450
All we have to do is
divide both sides of

81
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,330
this equation by 3.

82
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,930
So we're just left with an
x on the left-hand side.

83
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,840
So we divide by-- let me pick
a nicer color than that.

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,490
Let me do this pink color.

85
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,340
So you divide the
left-hand side by 3, the

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,540
right-hand side by 3.

87
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,260
And remember what
that's equivalent to.

88
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,070
The left-hand side, none of
this stuff exists anymore,

89
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,570
so we should ignore it.

90
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,120
None of this stuff
exists anymore.

91
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,270
In fact, let me clear it
out, just so that we don't

92
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,190
even have to look at it.

93
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,730
We subtracted it, so
let me clear it.

94
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,350
Let me clear it over here.

95
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,740
Let me clear it over here.

96
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,300
And so now we are dividing
both sides by 3.

97
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,640
Divide the left-hand side by 3.

98
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,890
It's 1, 2, 3.

99
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,580
So three groups, each of
them have an x in it.

100
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,670
If you divide this right-hand
side by 3, you have 1, 2 and 3.

101
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,560
So it's three groups of four.

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,550
So when you do it
mathematically here,

103
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,680
the 3's cancel out.

104
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,975
3 times something divided by
3 is just the something.

105
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:48,220
So you're left with x is
equal to, and then 12

106
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,103
divided by 3 is 4.

107
00:04:53,072 --> 00:04:55,157
You get x is equal to 4,
and you get that exact

108
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:56,070
same thing over here.

109
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,140
When you divided 3x into
groups of three, each of

110
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,730
the groups had an x in it.

111
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,610
When you divided 12 into groups
of three, each of the groups

112
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,230
have a 4 in it, so x
must be equal to 4.

113
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,390
x is equal to 4.

114
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,110
Let's do another one, and this
time I won't draw it all out

115
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,610
like this, but hopefully,
you'll see that the same type

116
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,750
of processes are involved.

117
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,380
Let's say I have-- let me
scroll down a little bit.

118
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,060
Let's say I have 7x.

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:36,880
So 7x-- and I'll do a slightly
more complicated one this time.

120
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:48,330
7x minus 2 is equal to-- I'll
make the numbers not work

121
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,360
out nice and clean-- is
equal to negative 10.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,400
Now, this all of a sudden
becomes a lot more-- you know,

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,570
we have a negative sign.

124
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,310
We have a negative over
here, but we're going to

125
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,300
do the exact same thing.

126
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,510
The first thing we want to do
if we want to get the left-hand

127
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,450
side simplified to just 7x
is we want to get rid

128
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,950
of this negative 2.

129
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,170
And what can we add or subtract
to both sides of the equation

130
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,200
to get rid of this negative 2?

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,050
Well, if we add 2 to the
left-hand side, these two

132
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,470
guys will cancel out.

133
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,420
But remember, this
is equal to that.

134
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,950
If we want the equality to
still hold, if we add 2 to the

135
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,070
left-hand side, we also have to
do it to the right-hand side.

136
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,990
So what is the new left-hand
side going to be equal to?

137
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,950
So we have 7x, negative
2 plus 2 is just 0.

138
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,090
I could write plus 0, or I
could just write nothing there,

139
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,130
and I'll just write nothing.

140
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,920
So we get 7x is equal to-- now,
what's negative 10 plus 2?

141
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,670
And this is a little bit
of review of adding and

142
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,970
subtracting negative numbers.

143
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,810
Remember.

144
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,840
I'll draw the number
line here for you.

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,090
If I draw the number line--
so this is 9, this is 1.

146
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,360
We could keep going in
the positive direction.

147
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,550
Negative 10 is out here.

148
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,850
Negative 10, negative 9,
negative 8, negative 7.

149
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,860
There's a bunch
of numbers here.

150
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,040
You know, dot, dot, dot.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,350
I don't have space to draw them
all, but we're starting at

152
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,350
negative 10, and we're adding 2
to it, so we're moving in the

153
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,780
positive direction on
the number lines.

154
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,960
So we're going 1, 2.

155
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,520
So it's negative 8.

156
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,540
Don't get confused.

157
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,130
Don't say, OK, 10 plus 2
is 12, so negative 10

158
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,070
plus 2 is negative 12.

159
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,800
No!

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,260
Negative 10 minus 2 would be
negative 12 because you'd

161
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,440
be going more negative.

162
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,200
Here, we have a negative
number, but we're

163
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,960
going to the right.

164
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
We're going in the positive
direction, so this

165
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,020
is negative 8.

166
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,010
So we have 7x is
equal to negative 8.

167
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,990
So now you might be saying,
well, how do I do this

168
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,760
type of a problem?

169
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,170
You know, I have a
negative number here.

170
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,425
You do it the exact same way.

171
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:49,410
If we want to just have an x on
the left-hand side, we have to

172
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,850
divide the left-hand side by 7,
so that the 7x divided by 7,

173
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,610
just the 7's cancel out,
you're left with x.

174
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,220
So let's do that.

175
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,880
If you divide by 7, those
cancel out, but you can't just

176
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,130
do it to the left-hand side.

177
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,880
Anything you do to the left,
you have to do to the right

178
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,950
in order for the equality
to still hold true.

179
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,360
So let's divide the
right by 7 as well.

180
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,270
And we are left with
just an x is equal to

181
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,760
negative 8 divided by 8.

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
We could work it out.

183
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,810
It'll be some type of a
decimal, if you were to use a

184
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,810
calculator, or you could just
leave it in fraction form.

185
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,200
Negative 8 divided by
7 is negative 8/7.

186
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,560
Negative 8/7, or if you want to
write it as a mixed number, x

187
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,500
is equal to 7 goes into 8 one
time and has a remainder of 1,

188
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,560
so it's negative 1 and 1/7.

189
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,690
Either one would be acceptable.
