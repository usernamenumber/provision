1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,133
You'll often hear the words "depreciation" and "amortization" used together.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:07,361
And what I want to do in this video is understand a little bit better

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:12,283
why they are similar and the slight difference between the two.

4
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:15,766
So in our previous examples we've done depreciation

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:20,067
so you can imagine, in period 0 we buy a truck for $60,000

6
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:22,686
and instead of just expensing it in period 0,

7
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:25,426
instead of putting $60,000 expense right over here,

8
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,680
we capitalize it.

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,095
We say that we have a $60,000 asset.

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:33,135
So this is right at the end of period 0, or the beginning of period 1

11
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:37,779
And what we do is we spread out this expense over the period of time

12
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,600
that we're actually going to use the truck.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,133
So in period 1, we depreciate the truck by $20,000.

14
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,045
We're assuming we have a 3-year life of this truck,

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,438
and we're just going to do what's called

16
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,296
"Straight Line Depreciation"

17
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:53,011
We're just going to take the cost of the truck, and divide it by its life.

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,544
There are other ways to depreciate it.

19
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,680
Maybe you could imagine that it depreciates faster in the first year.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,209
But this is the simplest type, and is actually used by a lot of companies.

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,438
Just Straight Line Depreciation.

22
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,760
So after we use $20,000

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,129
we depreciate the truck by $20,000

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,683
we expense it in that year, so this is literally an expense.

25
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:13,445
Then at the end of period 1, it is now on our books for $40,000

26
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:17,021
Then in period 2, we depreciate it by another $20,000

27
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,618
it's going to be a $20,000 expense in period 2.

28
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:25,380
Now on our books, at the end of period 2, it's going to be worth $20,000

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,400
Then in period 3, we expense another $20,000 on our income statement

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,018
and then, at least for this truck, assuming we hadn't bought a new one yet

31
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:36,293
We've completely written it off.

32
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:42,888
It is now worth $0 on our books, because, based on what we assumed, it's not useful anymore.

33
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:44,792
We kind of have to scrap this truck.

34
00:01:44,792 --> 00:01:46,371
That's depreciation.

35
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,296
Now imagine if, to run our trucking business,

36
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:51,804
we also had to pay some type of license fee.

37
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:59,699
And let's say that the license fee was $4000

38
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:02,021
and we get to use it over 4 years.

39
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:06,015
So once again, you could've just put a $4,000 expense right over here,

40
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:09,683
but that's not really accurate, you're not just using that fee in that period.

41
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:12,052
That fee is going to be useful over the next 4 years.

42
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:18,043
So once again, you would put down the asset, you know, the paid license fee,

43
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:21,293
or maybe the prepaid license fee, depending on how you view it,

44
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:23,058
and then you would amortize that cost.

45
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,891
Which is essentially the same thing mathematically. You say

46
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,352
"Oh look! I'm going to use this over the next four years

47
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:33,043
essentially $1,000/year." So my license fee amortization in year 1

48
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,715
I'd say is $1,000

49
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:39,173
and then on my books I would carry the license fee for $3,000

50
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:43,027
and then I'd amortize another $1,000, and it would go down to $2,000

51
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:48,693
then amortize another $1,000, and at the end of period 3 it's now worth $1,000 on my books

52
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:54,034
Period 4, amortize another $1,000, now I've completely written it off

53
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,727
and I probably have to get another license at the point.

54
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:59,699
So mathematically, they're the same thing

55
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,046
even philosophically they're the same thing

56
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:04,715
The idea that, instead of expensing those expenses all at once,

57
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:10,055
you say "Look, they have some useful life, let me spread out the expense over their useful life."

58
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:14,328
The difference between the two, and you might have already realized this,

59
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:18,067
Is the appreciation is when you have hard assets

60
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:23,709
If you have a building, or a truck, or some type of equipment you would depreciate that asset

61
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,727
If you have a non-hard asset, or a financial asset

62
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:31,139
or something that's less tangible, then you would amoritze it.

63
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,333
It's just a different word depending on how tangible the asset is.

64
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,223
So if it's a license fee, or some other type of fee,

65
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:42,285
or some type of, maybe intellectual property, you would amortize the cost

66
00:03:42,285 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have a truck, or a building, or whatever, you would depreciate it.
