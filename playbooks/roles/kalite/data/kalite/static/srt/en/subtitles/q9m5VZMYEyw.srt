1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,520
I copied and pasted the next
view because they had a little

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,600
bit of a drawing, so I thought,
better than me

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,420
drawing it myself.

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,140
So we're on problem number 13
and I cut it off a little bit.

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,360
What is the volume of
the figure below?

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,670
Well, the volume is just
the width times the

8
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,550
height times the depth.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:21,580
So the volume is just going to
be-- the width is x plus 4

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,340
times x plus 1 times x plus 6.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,510
X plus 4 times x plus 1.

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,810
We can do this in our head, but
I always find it easier to

13
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,780
do it this way. x plus
1 times x plus 1.

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,260
1 times 4 is 4.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,420
1 times x is x.

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,630
And then you have the x place.
x times 4 is 4x, x

17
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,250
times x is x squared.

18
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,010
Fair enough.

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,270
So that equals x squared
plus 5x plus 4.

20
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,630
Now, we have to multiply that
times x plus 6, right?

21
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,690
We did x plus 4 and x plus 1,
and this was a 6. x plus 6,

22
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,850
that's this side.

23
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,730
So now we multiply this
times x plus 6.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,270
6 times 4 is 24.

25
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,900
6 times 5x is 30x.

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,315
6 times x squared
is 6x squared.

27
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,910
I hope you can read
what I'm writing.

28
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,770
Scroll down a little bit.

29
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,920
Now we do the x's place.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,130
I'll do it in a different color
because I think I'm

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,921
going to run out of--
so x times 4 is 4x.

32
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,020
x times 5x is 5x squared.

33
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,860
   

34
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,795
x times x squared is
x to the third.

35
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:40,210
Have to run into
the white area.

36
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,760
So this is x to the third.

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,750
What's 6 plus 5?

38
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,580
Plus 11x squared plus
30x-- no, no, sorry.

39
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,720
30 plus 4 is plus 34x plus 24.

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,610
So x to the third, all of these
choices are x to the

41
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,820
third, plus 11x squared,
so it's either b

42
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,000
your d, plus 34x.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,730
That's that one.

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,570
Plus 34x plus 24.

45
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,330
So the choice is b.

46
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,235
Next problem All right.

47
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:17,200
   

48
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,670
8a to the third plus
c to the third.

49
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,770
Which of these choices?

50
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,760
So that's interesting.

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,960
This is not a trivial thing
to just factor.

52
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,290
We'll have to do some
intuition here.

53
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,950
Well, let's think about it.

54
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,010
In order to have a positive
number for the a term, every

55
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,800
time we're multiplying, we have
to have a positive, so

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,710
this is 2a times 2a times 2a.

57
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,810
That would get us to
8a to the third.

58
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,490
But there's something
interesting about choice a,

59
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,210
why I already feel like
canceling out choice a.

60
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,930
Choice a is essentially
2a plus c to

61
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,570
the third power right?

62
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,580
Choice a is 2a plus c
to the third power.

63
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,280
And every time you multiply
this out, every time you

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,410
multiply 2a plus c times itself,
you're going to add

65
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,810
more terms. No terms are
going to cancel out.

66
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,900
I mean, if you were to square
this, you're going to get,

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,240
just to show you, you
get 4a squared

68
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,570
plus 4ac plus c squared.

69
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,800
And then to get the third power,
you'd multiply that

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,790
times 2a plus c.

71
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,990
So you're going to
get this thing.

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,420
You're actually going to get
four terms. Choice a is

73
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,240
definitely not the case.

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,795
In order for one of these to
simplify to this, we're going

75
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,950
to have to have some positives
and negatives there to cancel

76
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,462
out terms as you expand
these polynomials.

77
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,700
So let's look at the other
choices and see if

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
they make any sense.

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,890
2a times-- and I like looking
at the a terms and what

80
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,190
generates the c cubed terms and
maybe we can cancel out

81
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,040
some things.

82
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,370
2a times 4a squared, that's
8a to the third.

83
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,200
But minus c times c squared,
that's minus c to the the

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,590
third, right?

85
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,840
So I don't even have to worry
about multiplying

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,590
this whole thing out.

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,290
I know because the c cubed term
is going to come only

88
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,090
from this term multiplied
by this term.

89
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,450
There'll be other terms that
hopefully will cancel out, but

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,280
we know that choice b cannot be
the choice because minus c

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,660
times c squared is minus c to
the third, and this is a plus

92
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,480
right here.

93
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,190
So we know b can't be
the right answer.

94
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,779
Let's see, choice c.

95
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,810
I can use the same logic.

96
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,260
We have a minus c and
we have a plus c.

97
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,280
We have a plus c here.

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,770
We would have to have two plus
c's in order for this to work,

99
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,370
so this can't be the answer.

100
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,900
So just by deductive reasoning,
I can say it's

101
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,730
probably choice d, but I'm going
to prove it to you since

102
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,170
we're here to learn, not to just
answer things correctly.

103
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:42,060
So if I were to multiply those
two numbers, I have 4a squared

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,720
minus 2ac plus c squared,
and I'm multiplying that

105
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,580
times 2a plus c.

106
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,730
   

107
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,510
So I'm going to mix up all of
the terms a little bit, but

108
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,920
you will get the idea.

109
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,890
So the important thing when
you're multiplying, you could

110
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,700
do this in your head, is that
you multiply each of these

111
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,390
terms times each of those.

112
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,800
So c times all of that plus
this times all of of that.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,750
So c times all of that
is c times c squared.

114
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,100
I'm not doing it in the right
place notation like I did last

115
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,090
time because it gets a little
more confusing now.

116
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,010
But c times c squared
is c to the third.

117
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,700
   

118
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,650
c times minus 2ac is
minus 2ac squared.

119
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,570
c times 4a squared
is 4a squared c.

120
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,170
   

121
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,940
And now we can do this one.

122
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,380
2a times c squared.

123
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,860
   

124
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,730
I'm going to put it in this
place because it turns into ac

125
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,910
squared, right? ac squared
and I have a 2.

126
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,166
So 2a times c squared
is 2ac squared.

127
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,950
   

128
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,920
2a times minus 2ac, you get a
minus 4a squared c, so it's

129
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,980
minus 4a squared c.

130
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,170
This is a plus here.

131
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,520
And then 2a times 4a squared
is 8a to the third.

132
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,510
And luckily enough, let's see,
they get 8a to the third.

133
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,250
   

134
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,750
This cancels out, this cancel
out, and you get

135
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,130
plus c to the third.

136
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,210
So we were right by doing our
deductive reasoning, that

137
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,830
choice d was the answer.

138
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,170
Next problem.

139
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,420
I've run out of space.

140
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,740
   

141
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,210
Let me see what the next
problem even is.

142
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,740
Actually, where was I?

143
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,990
OK, I see.

144
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,500
OK, problem 15.

145
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,234
The total area of a rectangle
is 4x to the

146
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:47,205
fourth minus 9y squared.

147
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,720
   

148
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,660
Which factors could represent
the length times the width?

149
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,060
OK, so essentially you're saying
the length times the

150
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,765
width is going to be equal to
the area, which is 4x to the

151
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:04,610
fourth minus 9y squared.

152
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,350
So to some degree, we have to
factor this into multiple

153
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,290
expressions.

154
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,730
And the first thing you should
always look at when you have

155
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,790
to factor any type of an
expression, especially if

156
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,060
there's only two terms in the
expression, does it fit the

157
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,080
form a squared minus
b squared?

158
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,980
Because if it does, you can
factor this into a plus b

159
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,900
times a minus b.

160
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,580
And if you don't trust that
these equal each other, I've

161
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,250
made multiple videos about it,
but just multiply them. a plus

162
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,390
b times a minus b is equal to
a squared minus b squared.

163
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,630
And luckily, this fits
that format, right?

164
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,650
If a squared was equal to 4x to
the fourth, then what's a?

165
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,410
a would be equal
to 2x squared.

166
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,325
And if b squared is equal to 9y
squared, then b is equal to

167
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,620
the square root of that,
which is 3y.

168
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,670
And so this definitely
is equal to a

169
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,300
squared minus b squared.

170
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,200
So this expression right here
can be factored into a plus b

171
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,170
times a minus b.

172
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:17,160
So a plus b is 2x squared
plus 3y times a minus b.

173
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,250
2x squared minus 3y.

174
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,810
Let's see, which
choice is that?

175
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,920
2x squared plus 3y?

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,870
OK, they switched the order.

177
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:32,510
Choice a says 2x squared minus
3y times 2x squared plus 3y,

178
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,179
which is the same thing.

179
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,929
You can switch orders when
you're multiplying, so the

180
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,140
answer is a.

181
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,610
Next problem, problem 16.

182
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,400
I'll switch colors
arbitrarily.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,850
Problem 16: Which product of
factors is equivalent to-- let

184
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,680
me copy and paste this because
this is an interesting-- so

185
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,860
let me copy and paste
this problem.

186
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,450
OK, I've copied it, and now
let me paste it here.

187
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,570
OK, which product of factors
is equivalent to that thing

188
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,010
over there?

189
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,340
So let's simplify that.

190
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,090
That's my first impulse.

191
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,060
No, no, no, we don't even
have to simplify it.

192
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,960
This fits our same pattern,
right, if we can fit the

193
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,730
pattern a squared
minus b squared.

194
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,550
So look at this thing.

195
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,060
This has x plus 1 squared
minus y squared.

196
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,560
So if we said that a is equal to
x plus 1 and b is equal to

197
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,950
y, then we fit the pattern.

198
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,530
This is a squared
minus b squared.

199
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,320
So then this thing can just
factor into a plus b

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,620
times a minus b.

201
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,950
So what's a plus b?

202
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,440
It's x plus 1 plus y.

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,530
That's a plus b.

204
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:56,320
And then a minus b is
x plus 1 minus y.

205
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,030
And that is choice d.

206
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,890
That problem was easier than I
thought I was going to be.

207
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,510
Choice d, right there.

208
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,710
And I'm out of time again.

209
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,990
I'll see you in the
next video.

210
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,400
