1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,010
   

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,070
Let's do a little compare and
contrast between the dot

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,710
product and the cross product.

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,670
Let me just make two vectors--
just visually draw them.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,620
And maybe if we have time,
we'll, actually figure out

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,970
some dot and cross products
with real vectors.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:36,170
   

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:47,070
Let's call the first one--
That's the angle between them.

9
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,550
OK.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,550
So let's just go over the
definitions and then we'll

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,980
work on the intuition.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,360
And hopefully, you have a little
bit of both already.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,240
So what is a dot b?

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,000
Well first of all, that's the
exact same thing as b dot a.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,590
Order does not matter when you
take the dot product because

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,230
you end up with just a number.

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,440
And that is equal to the
magnitude of a times the

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,145
magnitude of b times cosine
of the angle between them.

19
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:24,450
Let's look at the definition
of the cross product.

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,810
What is a cross b?

21
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,615
Well first of all, that does
not equal b cross a.

22
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:37,650
It actually equals the opposite
direction, or you

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,900
could view it as the negative
of b cross a.

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,980
Because the vector that you end
up with ends up flipped,

25
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,510
whichever order you do it in.

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:51,600
But a cross b, that is equal to
the magnitude of vector a

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,580
times the magnitude of vector
b-- so far, it looks a lot

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,420
like the dot product, but this
is where the diverge is--

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,690
times the sine of the
angle between them.

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,030
The sine of the angle
between them.

31
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,070
And this is where it
really diverges.

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,610
When we took the dot
product, we just

33
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,420
ended up with a number.

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,520
This is just a number.

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,729
There's no direction here.

36
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,340
This is just a scalar
quantity.

37
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,700
But the cross product, we take
the magnitude of a times the

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,250
magnitude of b, times the sine
of the angle between them, and

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,600
that provides a magnitude, but
it also has a direction.

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,840
And that direction is provided
by this normal vector.

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,550
It's a unit vector.

42
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,820
A unit vector gets that
little hat on it.

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,470
It's a unit vector, and
what direction is it?

44
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,320
Well, that's defined by
the right hand rule.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,200
This is a vector.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:45,870
It's perpendicular
to both a and b.

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,740
And then you might say, a and
b, the way I drew them,

48
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,810
they're both sitting in the
plane of this video screen, or

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,200
your video screen.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,670
So in order for something to
be perpendicular to both of

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,550
these, it either has to pop out
of the screen or pop into

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,240
the screen, right?

53
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,110
And when you learned about the
cross product, I said there's

54
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,110
two ways of showing a vector
popping out of the screen.

55
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,430
It looks like that because
that's the tip of an arrow.

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,110
And to show a vector going into
the screen, it's like

57
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,040
that because that is the
back of an arrow.

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,980
The rear end of an arrow.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,020
So how do you know which
of these two it is?

60
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,350
Because both of these vectors
are perpendicular to a and b.

61
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,480
That's where you take your right
hand and you use the

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,470
right hand rule.

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,120
So you take your index finger
in the direction of a, your

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,730
middle finger in the direction
of b, and then your thumb

65
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,210
points in the direction of n.

66
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,460
So let's do that.

67
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,695
I'm looking at my hand.

68
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:40,300
It's not an easy thing to do
with your right hand, but your

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,820
right hand is going to look
something like this.

70
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Your index finger will go
in the direction of a.

71
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,200
Your middle finger goes
in the direction of b.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,040
So that's my middle finger.

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,610
And then my other two fingers
just do what they need to do.

74
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,160
I like to just bend them
out of the way.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,160
   

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,940
So they just curl
around my hand.

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,280
And then what direction
is my thumb in?

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,820
My thumb-- well, actually I drew
it at the wrong angle.

79
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,300
My thumb is actually going
in this direction, right?

80
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,730
Into the page.

81
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,830
This is the top of my hand.

82
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,550
These are like my veins.

83
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,450
Or, if I actually drew it
correctly, where you would see

84
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,690
your hand from side-- so it
would look like this.

85
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,390
You would see your pinky.

86
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,760
Your palm and your pinky
would be like that.

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,630
And your other finger
like this.

88
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,460
Your middle finger would go
in the direction of b.

89
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,900
Your index finger goes in the
direction of a, and you

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,430
wouldn't even see your thumb,
because your thumb is pointing

91
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,960
straight down.

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,520
But I think you get the point.
a cross b, this n vector is

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,780
pointing straight down.

94
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,630
It's a unit vector.

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,750
And this provides
the magnitude.

96
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,240
Unit vector just means it
has a magnitude of one.

97
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,560
So the magnitudes of the cross
and the dot products seem

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
pretty close.

99
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,440
They both have the magnitude
of both vectors there.

100
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,720
Dot product, cosine theta.

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,980
Cross product sine of theta.

102
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,710
But then, the huge difference
is that sine

103
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,730
of theta has a direction.

104
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,410
It is a different
vector that is

105
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,360
perpendicular to both of these.

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,340
Now, let's get the intuition.

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,830
And if you've watched the videos
on the dot and the

108
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,420
cross product, hopefully you
have a little intuition.

109
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,740
But I review it because I think
it all fits together

110
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,230
when you see them
with each other.

111
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:42,060
   

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,290
First, let's study a,
b cosine of theta.

113
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,470
If you watched the dot product
video, cosine of theta, if you

114
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,860
took, let's say, b
cosine of theta.

115
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,750
What is b cosine of theta?

116
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,930
b cosine of theta-- and you
could work it out on your own

117
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,690
time-- if you say cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse, the

118
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,140
magnitude of b cosine theta is
actually going to be the

119
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,520
magnitude of, if you dropped a
perpendicular-- I'll use a

120
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,940
different color here-- if you
dropped a perpendicular here,

121
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,250
this length right here--
that's b cosine theta.

122
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,680
Let me draw it separately.

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,140
I don't want to mess up
this picture too much.

124
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,390
So if that's b.

125
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:30,890
   

126
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:40,320
If that's a-- And that's b.

127
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,610
That's a.

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,540
This is theta.

129
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,236
b cosine theta, if you drop a
line perpendicular to a, this

130
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,590
is a right angle.

131
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,350
b cosine theta, adjacent
over hypotenuse is

132
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,910
equal to cosine theta.

133
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,210
So it would be the projection
of b going in the same

134
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,230
direction as a.

135
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,810
So it would be this magnitude.

136
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,770
   

137
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,120
That is b cosine theta.

138
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,180
So the magnitude of that vector
right there is the

139
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,720
magnitude of b cosine
of theta.

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,910
So when you're taking the dot
product, at least the example

141
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,970
I just did, if you view it as
the magnitude of a times the

142
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,570
magnitude of b cosine theta,
you're saying what part of b

143
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,680
goes in the same
direction as a?

144
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,870
And whatever that magnitude is,
let me just multiply that

145
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,980
times the magnitude of a.

146
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,360
And I have the dot product.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
Let's take the pieces that
go the same direction and

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,590
multiply them.

149
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,040
So how much do they
move together?

150
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,310
Or do they point together?

151
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,510
Or you could view it
the other way.

152
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,050
You could view the dot product
as-- and I did this in the dot

153
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,510
product video-- you could view
it as a cosine of theta, b.

154
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,480
Because it doesn't matter.

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,990
These are all scalar quantities,
so it doesn't

156
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,560
matter what order you take
the multiplication in.

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,270
And a cosine theta is
the same thing.

158
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,350
It's the magnitude of the a
vector that's going in the

159
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,060
same direction of b.

160
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,270
Or the projection of a onto b.

161
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,620
So this vector right here is a
cosine theta; the magnitude of

162
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,940
a cosine theta.

163
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,010
And they're actually
the same number.

164
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,320
If you take how much of b goes
in the direction of a, and

165
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,400
multiply that with the magnitude
of a, that gives you

166
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,550
the same number as how much of
a goes in the direction of b,

167
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,270
and then multiply the
two magnitudes.

168
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,100
Now, what is a, b sine theta?

169
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,710
a, b, sine theta.

170
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,299
Well if this vector right here
is a cosine theta-- and you

171
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,700
learned this when you learned
how to take the

172
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,600
components of vectors.

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,460
This vector right here is the
magnitude of a sine theta.

174
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,330
You could rewrite this as the
magnitude of a sine theta

175
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,750
times the magnitude of b in that
normal vector direction.

176
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,830
So if you take a sine theta
times b, you're saying what

177
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,460
part of a doesn't go the
same direction as b.

178
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,290
What part of a is completely
perpendicular to b-- has

179
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,390
nothing to do is b.

180
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,100
They share nothing in common.

181
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,930
It goes in a completely
different direction.

182
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,340
That's a sine theta.

183
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,560
And so you take the product of
this with b and then you get a

184
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,690
third vector.

185
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,930
And it almost says,
how different

186
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,950
are these two vectors?

187
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,390
And it points in a different
direction.

188
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,810
It gives you this-- sometimes
it's called a pseudo vector,

189
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,330
because it applies
to some concepts

190
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,060
that are pseudo vectors.

191
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,750
But the most important of these
concepts is torque, when

192
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,970
we talk about the magnetic
field; the force of a magnetic

193
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,320
field on electric charge.

194
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
These are all forces, or these
are all physical phenomena,

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,170
where what matters isn't the
direction of the force with

196
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,110
another vector, it's the
direction of the force

197
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,630
perpendicular to
another vector.

198
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,080
And so that's where the cross
product comes in useful.

199
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,140
Anyway, hopefully, that gave
you a little intuition.

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,280
And you could have done
it the other way.

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,310
You could have written
this as b sine theta.

202
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,800
And then you would have said
that's the component of b that

203
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,900
is perpendicular to a.

204
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,665
So b sine theta actually would
have been this vector.

205
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:02,140
   

206
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,330
Or let me draw it here.

207
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,070
That would make more sense.

208
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,210
This would be b sine theta.

209
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,030
So you could switch orders.

210
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,160
You could visualize
it either way.

211
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,500
You could say this is the
magnitude of b that is

212
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,550
completely perpendicular to a,
multiply the two, and use the

213
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,000
right hand rule to get
that normal vector.

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,350
And we just decided that we're
going to use the right hand

215
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,630
rule to have a common
convention.

216
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,470
But people could have used the
left hand rule, or they might

217
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,730
have used it a different way.

218
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,810
It's just a way that we have a
consistent framework, so that

219
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,770
when we take the cross product
we all know what direction

220
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,900
that normal vector
is pointing in.

221
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,400
Anyway.

222
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,300
In the next video I'll show you
how to actually compute

223
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,430
dot and cross products when
you're given them in their

224
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,100
component notation.

225
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,920
See you in the next video.
