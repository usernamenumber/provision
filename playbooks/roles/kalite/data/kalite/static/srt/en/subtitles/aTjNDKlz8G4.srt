1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:04,644
Welcome to the presentation on units.

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:06,348
Let's get started.

3
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:09,500
So if I were to tell you -- let me make sure my pen is set up

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
right -- if I were to tell you that someone is, let's say

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
they're driving at a speed of -- let's say it's Zack.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,201
(Wait, where did my pen go? Oh, I was using the wrong tool.)

7
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:24,800
So let's say I have Zack.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,468
And they're driving at a speed of, let me say,

9
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:39,056
twenty-eight feet per minute.

10
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:44,400
So what I'm going to ask you is if he's going twenty-eight feet in every

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:55,914
minute, how many inches will Zack travel in one second?

12
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,839
So how many inches per second is he going to be going?

13
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,100
Let's try to figure this one out.

14
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,400
So let's say if I had twenty-eight, and I'll write "ft" short for feet,

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,750
feet per minute, and I'll write "min" short for a minute.

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,768
So twenty-eight feet per minute, let's first figure out how many

17
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:17,929
inches per minute that is.

18
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:26,400
Well, we know that there are twelve inches per foot, right?

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
(And if you didn't know that you do now.)

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,437
So we know that there are twelve inches per foot.

21
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:36,363
So if he's going twenty-eight feet per minute, he's going to be going

22
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:41,285
twelve times that many inches per minute.

23
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:46,470
So, twelve times twenty-eight -- let's see. Let me do the little work down here --

24
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,763
twenty-eight times twelve is sixteen, fifty-six into two hundred and eighty.

25
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:57,401
(I probably shouldn't be doing it this messy.)

26
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:59,717
And this kind of stuff it would be OK to use a calculator,

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,661
although it's always good to do the math yourself.

28
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,385
It's good practice.

29
00:02:03,385 --> 00:02:07,869
So that's six, five plus eight is thirteen.

30
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,223
three hundred and thirty-six.

31
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:21,151
So that equals three hundred and thirty-six inches per minute.

32
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,838
And something interesting happened here is that

33
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:26,677
you notice that I had a foot in the numerator here, and I had a

34
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:28,438
foot in the denominator here.

35
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,451
So you can actually treat units just the same way

36
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,637
that you would treat actual numbers or variables.

37
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:35,038
You have the same number in the numerator and you have the same

38
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,294
number in the denominator, and your multiplying not adding,

39
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,812
you can cancel them out.

40
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:41,461
So the feet and the feet canceled out and that's

41
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:44,360
why we were left with inches per minute.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:53,562
I could have also written this as three hundred and thirty-six foot per minute

43
00:02:53,562 --> 00:03:00,200
times inches -- that's "inches" -- inches per foot.

44
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,169
And -- and -- because the foot per minute came from here,

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,085
and the inches per foot came from here.

46
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,500
Then I'll just cancel this out and now I've got inches per minute.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,349
So anyway, I don't want to confuse you too much

48
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,004
with all of that unit cancellation stuff.

49
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,700
The bottom line is you just remember, well if I'm going twenty-eight

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,274
feet per minute, I'm going to go twelve times that many inches

51
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:23,778
per minute, right, because there are twelve inches per foot.

52
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:28,672
So I'm going three hundred and thirty-six inches per minute.

53
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:31,392
So now I have the question, but we're not done, because the

54
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,577
question is how many inches am I going to be traveling

55
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,669
in one second.

56
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,000
So let me erase some of the stuff here at the bottom.

57
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:43,654
(Let me erase this...this is probably just going to confuse everybody.)

58
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,692
(Actually I'll erase this too.)

59
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,376
Ok.

60
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,719
So I'm going to be going...

61
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:09,100
So three hundred and thirty-six inches -- let's write it like that -- inches per minute,

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,000
and I want to know how many inches per second.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,909
Well what do we know?

64
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:22,000
We know that one minute -- and notice, I write it in the

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,150
numerator here because I want to cancel it out with

66
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,008
this minute here.

67
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:28,237
one minute is equal to how many seconds?

68
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:32,354
It equals sixty seconds. Right?

69
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:38,000
And this part can be confusing, but it's always good to just

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,200
take a step back and think about what I'm doing.

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,745
If I'm going to be going three hundred and thirty-six inches per minute, how many

72
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,000
inches am I going to travel in one second?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
Am I going to travel more than three hundred and thirty-six or am I going

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,200
to travel less than three hundred and thirty-six inches per second.

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,872
Well obviously less, because a second is a much

76
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,761
shorter period of time.

77
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:59,600
So if I'm in a much shorter period of time, I'm going

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,349
to be traveling a much shorter distance,

79
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:03,946
if I'm going the same speed.

80
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,364
So I should be dividing by a number, which makes sense.

81
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:08,361
I'm going to be dividing by sixty.

82
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,359
I know this can be very confusing at the beginning, but

83
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:13,200
that's why I always want you to think about should I be getting

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,100
a larger number or should I be getting a smaller number and

85
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,638
that will always give you a good reality check.

86
00:05:17,715 --> 00:05:20,162
And if you just want to look at how it turns out in terms of

87
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,600
units, we know from the problem that we want this minutes to

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,033
cancel out with something and get into seconds.

89
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,300
So if we have minutes in the denominator in the units here,

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,500
we want the minutes in the numerator here, and the seconds

91
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,795
in the denominator here.

92
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:37,179
And one minute is equal to sixty seconds.

93
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,878
So here, once again, the minutes and the

94
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:41,907
minutes cancel out.

95
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:53,656
And we get three hundred and thirty-six over sixty inches per second.

96
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:57,340
[coughs] (Excuse me.)

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,070
Now if I were to actually divide this out, we could see --

98
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,600
actually we could just divide the numerator and the denominator by six.

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,307
six goes into three hundred and thirty-six, what, fifty-six times?

100
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:14,200
fifty-six over ten, and then we can divide that again by two.

101
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,903
So then that gets us twenty-eight over five.

102
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:34,892
And twenty-eight over five -- let's see, five goes into twenty-eight five times, twenty-five.

103
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:38,300
Three, five point six.

104
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,300
So this equals 5.6.

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,024
So I think we now just solved the problem.

106
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:50,100
If Zack is going twenty-eight feet in every minute, that's his

107
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,359
speed, he's actually going 5.6 inches per second.

108
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:59,400
Hopefully that kind of made sense.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,600
Let's try to see if we could do another one.

110
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:16,900
If I'm going ninety-one feet per second, how many miles

111
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,100
per hour is that?

112
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:29,353
Well, ninety-one feet per second.

113
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:32,185
So how many -- If we want to say how many miles that is, should we be

114
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,111
dividing or should we be multiplying?

115
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,800
We should be dividing because it's going to be a

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,501
smaller number of miles.

117
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:44,900
And we know that one mile is equal to -- and you might want to just

118
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,021
memorize this -- five thousand, two hundred and eighty feet.

119
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:50,901
It's actually a pretty useful number to know.

120
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,800
And then that will actually cancel out the feet.

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,585
Then we want to go from seconds to hours, right?

122
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:03,161
So, if we go from seconds to hours, if I can travel ninety-one feet

123
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:06,000
per second, how many will I travel in an hour, I'm going to

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,300
be getting a larger number because an hour's a much larger

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,173
period of time than a second.

126
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,200
And how many seconds are there in an hour?

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,864
Well, there are three thousand, six hundred seconds in an hour.

128
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:18,700
sixty seconds per minute and sixty minutes per hour.

129
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,600
So three thousand, six hundred over one seconds per hour.

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,353
And these seconds will cancel out.

131
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:32,743
Then we're just left with, we just multiply everything out.

132
00:08:32,743 --> 00:08:42,449
We get in the numerator, ninety-one times thirty-six hundred, right?

133
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,400
ninety-one times one times thirty-six hundred.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,226
In the denominator we just have five thousand, two hundred and eighty.

135
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:54,338
This time around I'm actually going to use a calculator --

136
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:57,124
let me bring up the calculator just to show you that I'm

137
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,842
using the calculator.

138
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:06,700
Let's see, so if I say ninety-one times thirty-six hundred, Woops! I messed up.

139
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,914
(carefully) Ninety-one times thirty-six hundred. that equals a huge

140
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:17,300
number divided by five thousand, two hundred and eighty.

141
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:33,254
(Oh, man. I keep messing up.) [More errors.] This calculator -- I think my mouse is messed up. Let me see if I can type it.

142
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:44,546
91 times 3,600 divided by 5,280 -- 62.05!

143
00:09:44,546 --> 99:59:59,999
So that equals 62.05 miles per hour.
