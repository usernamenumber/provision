1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,190
If you followed some of the
mathematics, and some of the

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,590
thermodynamic principles in the
last several videos, what

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,130
occurs in this video might
just blow your mind.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,570
So not to set expectations
too high, let's just

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,506
start off with it.

7
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:17,160
So let's say I have
a container.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,990
And in that container,
I have gas particles.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,650
   

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,480
Inside of that container,
they're bouncing around like

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,000
gas particles tend to do,
creating some pressure on the

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,760
container of a certain volume.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,784
And let's say I have
n particles.

14
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:36,520
   

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,920
Now, each of these particles
could be

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,860
in x different states.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,110
Let me write that down.

18
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:56,420
   

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,800
What do I mean by state?

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,640
Well, let's say I
take particle A.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,840
Let me make particle A
a different color.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,080
Particle A could be down here
in this corner, and it could

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,810
have some velocity like that.

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,190
It could also be in that
corner and have a

25
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,940
velocity like that.

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,080
Those would be two
different states.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,070
It could be up here, and have
a velocity like that.

28
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,050
It could be there and have
a velocity like that.

29
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,260
If you were to add up all the
different states, and there

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,340
would be a gazillion, of
them, you would get x.

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,550
That blue particle could have
x different states.

32
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,470
You don't know.

33
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,740
We're just saying, look.

34
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,545
I have this container.

35
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:26,470
It's got n particles.

36
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,670
So we just know that each
of them could be

37
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,330
in x different states.

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,620
Now, if each of them can be in
x different states, how many

39
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,950
total configurations are there
for the system as a whole?

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,080
Well, particle A could be in x
different states, and then

41
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,990
particle B could be in
x different places.

42
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,340
So times x.

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,880
If we just had two particles,
then you would multiply all

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,130
the different places where
X could be times all the

45
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,970
different places where the red
particle could be, then you'd

46
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,290
get all the different
configurations for the system.

47
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,570
But we don't have just
two particles.

48
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,260
We have n particles.

49
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,690
So for every particle, you'd
multiply it times the number

50
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,840
of states it could have,
and you do that

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,729
a total of n times.

52
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,290
And this is really just
combinatorics here.

53
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,540
You do it n times.

54
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,840
This system would have
n configurations.

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,940
For example, if I had two
particles, each particle had

56
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,860
three different potential
states, how many different

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,330
configurations could there be?

58
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,210
Well, for every three that one
particle could have, the other

59
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,540
one could have three different
states, so you'd have nine

60
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,190
different states.

61
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,970
You'd multiply them.

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,690
If you had another particle with
three different states,

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,050
you'd multiply that by
three, so you have

64
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,530
27 different states.

65
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,660
Here we have n particles.

66
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,020
Each of them could be in
x different states.

67
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,380
So the total number of
configurations we have for our

68
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,580
system-- x times itself n times
is just x to the n.

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,790
So we have x to the n states
in our system.

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,530
Now, let's say that we like
thinking about how many states

71
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,080
a system can have. Certain
states have less-- for

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,340
example, if I had fewer
particles, I would have fewer

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,510
potential states.

74
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,140
Or maybe if I had a smaller
container, I would also have

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,240
fewer potential states.

76
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,510
There would be fewer potential
places for our little

77
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,320
particles to exist.

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,180
So I want to create some type
of state variable that tells

79
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,230
me, well, how many states
can my system be in?

80
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,030
So this is kind of a macrostate
variable.

81
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,040
It tells me, how many states
can my system be in?

82
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,730
And let's call it
s for states.

83
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,640
For the first time in
thermodynamics, we're actually

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,050
using a letter that in some way
is related to what we're

85
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,930
actually trying to measure.

86
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,650
s for states.

87
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,750
And since the states, they can
grow really large, let's say I

88
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,350
like to take the logarithm
of the number of states.

89
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,860
Now this is just how I'm
defining my state variable.

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,120
I get to define it.

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,970
So I get to put a logarithm
out front.

92
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,790
So let me just put
a logarithm.

93
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,810
So in this case, it would be the
logarithm of my number of

94
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,690
states-- so it would be x to the
n, where this is number of

95
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,940
potential states.

96
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,250
   

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,330
And you know, we need some
kind of scaling factor.

98
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,710
Maybe I'll change the
units eventually.

99
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,519
So let me put a little
constant out front.

100
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,709
Every good formula needs
a constant to

101
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,790
get our units right.

102
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,500
I'll make that a lowercase k.

103
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,580
So that's my definition.

104
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,950
I call this my state variable.

105
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,470
If you give me a system, I
should, in theory, be able to

106
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,170
tell you how many states
the system can take on.

107
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,760
Fair enough.

108
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,760
So let me close that
box right there.

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Now let's say that I were to
take my box that I had-- let

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,350
me copy and paste it.

111
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,790
I take that box.

112
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,860
And it just so happens
that there was an

113
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,450
adjacent box next to it.

114
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,120
They share this wall.

115
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,505
They're identical in size,
although what I just drew

116
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:03,560
isn't identical in size.

117
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,290
But they're close enough.

118
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,820
They're identical in size.

119
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,210
And what I do, is I blow
away this wall.

120
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,010
I just evaporate it,
all of a sudden.

121
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,680
It just disappears.

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,040
So this wall just disappears.

123
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,790
Now, what's going to happen?

124
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,350
Well, as soon as I blow away
this wall, this is very much

125
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,210
not an isostatic process.

126
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,700
Right?

127
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,250
All hell's going
to break loose.

128
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,350
I'm going to blow away this
wall, and you know, the

129
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,020
particles that were about to
bounce off the wall are just

130
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,550
going to keep going.

131
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,890
Right?

132
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,480
They're going to keep going
until they can maybe bounce

133
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
off of that wall.

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,110
So right when I blow away this
wall, there's no pressure

135
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,580
here, because these guys have
nothing to bounce off to.

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,180
While these guys don't
know anything.

137
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,690
They don't know anything until
they come over here and say,

138
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,680
oh, no wall.

139
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,140
So the pressure is in flux.

140
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,000
Even the volume is in flux, as
these guys make their way

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,990
across the entire expanse
of the new volume.

142
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,800
So everything is in flux.

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,580
Right?

144
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,820
And so what's our new volume?

145
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,520
If we call this volume,
what's this?

146
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,330
This is now 2 times
the volume.

147
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,120
   

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,230
Let's think about some of the
other state variables we know.

149
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,800
We know that the pressure
is going to go down.

150
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,450
We can even relate it, because
we know that our

151
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,670
volume is twice it.

152
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,170
Is 2 times the volume.

153
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,330
What about the temperature?

154
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,890
Well, the temperature change.

155
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,620
Temperature is average kinetic
energy, right?

156
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,790
Or it's a measure of average
kinetic energy.

157
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,910
So all of these molecules
here, each of them have

158
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,700
kinetic energy.

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,930
They could be different amounts
of kinetic energy, but

160
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,410
temperature is a measure of
average kinetic energy.

161
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,140
Now, if I blow away this wall,
does that change the kinetic

162
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,680
energy of these molecules?

163
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,310
No!

164
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,670
It doesn't change it at all.

165
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,700
So the temperature
is constant.

166
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,480
So if this is T1, then the
temperature of this system

167
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
here is T1.

168
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,320
And you might say, hey, Sal,
wait, that doesn't make sense.

169
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,780
In the past, when my cylinder
expanded, my

170
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,450
temperature went down.

171
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,450
And the reason why the
temperature went down in that

172
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,810
case is because your molecules
were doing work.

173
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,540
They expanded the container
itself.

174
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,890
They pushed up the cylinder.

175
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,300
So they expended some of their
kinetic energy to do the work.

176
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,830
In this case, I just blew
away that wall.

177
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,350
These guys did no work
whatsoever, so they didn't

178
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,990
have to expend any of their
kinetic energy to do any work.

179
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,710
So their temperature
did not change.

180
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,620
So that's interesting.

181
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,530
Fair enough.

182
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,310
Well, in this new world,
what happens?

183
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,380
Eventually I get to a situation
where my molecules

184
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,290
fill the container.

185
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:33,590
Right?

186
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,850
We know that from
common sense.

187
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,500
And if you think about
it on a microlevel,

188
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,330
why does that happen?

189
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,540
It's not a mystery.

190
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,070
You know, on this direction,
things were bouncing and they

191
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,690
keep bouncing.

192
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,750
But when they go here, there
used to be a wall, and then

193
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,920
they'll just keep going,
and then they'll

194
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,210
start bouncing here.

195
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,010
So when you have gazillion
particles doing a gazillion of

196
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,800
these bounces, eventually,
they're just as likely to be

197
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,830
here as they are over there.

198
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,220
Now.

199
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,400
Let's do our computation
again.

200
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,950
In our old situation, when we
just looked at this, each

201
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,370
particle could be in one of x
places, or in one of x states.

202
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,330
Now it could be in twice
as many states, right?

203
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:16,790
Now, each particle could be
in 2x different states.

204
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,990
Why do I say 2x?

205
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,030
Because I have twice
the area to be in.

206
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,320
Now, the states aren't just, you
know, position in space.

207
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,610
But everything else-- so, you
know, before here, maybe I had

208
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,960
a positions in space times b
positions, or b momentums, you

209
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,789
know, where those are all the
different momentums, and that

210
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,620
was equal to x.

211
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,490
Now I have 2a positions in
volume that I could be in.

212
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,270
I have twice the volume
to deal with.

213
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,860
So I have 2a positions in volume
I can be at, but my

214
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,680
momentum states are going to
still be-- I just have b

215
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,150
momentum states-- so this
is equal to 2x.

216
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,680
I now can be in 2x different
states, just because I have 2

217
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,450
times the volume to travel
around in, right?

218
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,570
So how many states are
there for the system?

219
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,100
Well, each particle can
be in 2x states.

220
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,080
So this is 2x times
2x times 2x.

221
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,680
And I'm going to do
that n times.

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,500
So my new s-- so this is, you
know, let's call this s

223
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,540
initial-- so my s final, my
new way of measuring my

224
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,880
states, is going to be equal to
that little constant that I

225
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,000
threw in there, times the
natural log of the

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,190
new number of states.

227
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,620
So what is it?

228
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,030
It's 2x to the n power.

229
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,880
   

230
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,520
So my question to you is, what
is my change in s when I blew

231
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,770
away the wall?

232
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,710
You know, there was this room
here the entire time, although

233
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,580
these particles really
didn't care because

234
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,710
this wall was there.

235
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,120
So what is the change in s when
I blew away this wall?

236
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,760
And this should be clear.

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,050
The temperature didn't
change, because no

238
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,570
kinetic energy was expended.

239
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,760
And this is all in isolation.

240
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,156
I should have said.

241
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:04,330
It's adiabatic.

242
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,790
There's no transfer of heat.

243
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,940
So that's also why the
temperature didn't change.

244
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,390
So what is our change in s?

245
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,700
Our change in s is equal to
our s final minus our s

246
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
initial, which is equal to--
what's our s final?

247
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,410
It's this expression,
right here.

248
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,020
It is k times the natural
log--and we can write this as

249
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,980
2 to the n, x to the n.

250
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,400
That's just exponent rules.

251
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,470
And from that, we're going to
subtract out our initial s

252
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,900
value, which was this. k natural
log of x to the n.

253
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,590
   

254
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,300
Now we can use our logarithm
properties to say, well, you

255
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,970
know, you take the logarithm of
a minus the logarithm of b,

256
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,400
you can just divide them.

257
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,770
So this is equal to k-- you
could factor that out-- times

258
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,120
the logarithm of 2 to the
N-- it's uppercase N,

259
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,890
so let me do that.

260
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,970
This is uppercase N.

261
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,430
I don't want to get confused
with Moles.

262
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,163
Uppercase N is the number of
particles we actually have. So

263
00:11:06,163 --> 00:11:11,430
it's 2 to upper case N times x
to the uppercase N divided by

264
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,630
x to the uppercase N.

265
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,890
So these two cancel out.

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,310
So our change in s is equal to
k times the natural log of 2

267
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,680
to the N-- or, if we wanted to
use our logarithm properties,

268
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,105
we could throw that
N out front.

269
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:31,510
And we could say, our change in
the s, whatever this state

270
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,130
variable I've defined-- and this
is a different definition

271
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:43,270
than I did in the last video--
is equal to big N, the number

272
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,070
of molecules we have, times my
little constant, times the

273
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,430
natural log of 2.

274
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,200
So by blowing away that wall and
giving my molecules twice

275
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,760
as much volume to travel around
in, my change in this

276
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,010
little state function
I defined is Nk the

277
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,470
natural log of 2.

278
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,400
And what really happened?

279
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,990
I mean, it clearly
went up, right?

280
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,730
I clearly have a positive
value here.

281
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,890
Natural log of 2 is
a positive value.

282
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,540
N is positive value.

283
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,360
It's going to be very large
number than the number of

284
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,040
molecules we had.

285
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,060
And I'm assuming my constant
I threw on there

286
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
is a positive value.

287
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,000
But what am I really
describing?

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,310
I'm saying that look, by blowing
away that wall, my

289
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,930
system can take on
more states.

290
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,700
There's more different
things it can do.

291
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,820
And I'll throw a little
word out here.

292
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,020
Its entropy has gone up.

293
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,490
Well, actually, let's
just define s

294
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,670
to be the word entropy.

295
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,110
We'll talk more about the
word in the future.

296
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,110
Its entropy has gone up, which
means the number of states we

297
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,040
have has gone up.

298
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,090
I shouldn't use the word entropy
without just saying,

299
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,622
entropy I'm defining
as equal to S.

300
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:54,530
But let's just keep it
with s. s for states.

301
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,010
The number of states we're
dealing with has gone up, and

302
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,580
it's gone up by this factor.

303
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,940
Actually, it's gone up by
a factor of 2 to the n.

304
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,100
And that's why it becomes
n natural log of 2.

305
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,110
Fair enough.

306
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,690
Now you're saying, OK.

307
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,280
This is nice, Sal.

308
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,600
You have this statistical way,
or I guess you could, this

309
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,110
combinatoric way of measuring
how many states this system

310
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,860
can take on.

311
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,360
And you looked at the
actual molecules.

312
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,450
You weren't looking at the
kind of macrostates.

313
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,460
And you were able to do that.

314
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,840
You came up with this macrostate
that says, that's

315
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
essentially saying, how many
states can I have?

316
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,740
But how does that relate to
that s that defined in the

317
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,440
previous video?

318
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,550
Remember, in the previous video,
I was looking for state

319
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,370
function that dealt with heat.

320
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:42,460
And I defined s, or change in
s-- I defined as change in s--

321
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,770
to be equal to the heat added
to the system divided by the

322
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,290
temperature that the
heat was added at.

323
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:57,020
So let's see if we can see
whether these things are

324
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,900
somehow related.

325
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,130
So let's go back to our
system, and go to a PV

326
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,400
diagram, and see if we can do
anything useful with that.

327
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,920
   

328
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,950
Alright.

329
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,940
OK.

330
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,800
So this is pressure,
this is volume.

331
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Now.

332
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,150
When we started off, before we
blew away the wall, we had

333
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,860
some pressure and some volume.

334
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,010
So this is V1.

335
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,060
And then we blew away the
wall, and we got to--

336
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,350
Actually, let me do it a
little bit differently.

337
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,030
   

338
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,290
I want that to be just
right there.

339
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,270
Let me make it right there.

340
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,770
So that is our V1.

341
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,680
This is our original state
that we're in.

342
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,990
So state initial, or
however we want it.

343
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,970
That's our initial pressure.

344
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,260
And then we blew away
the wall, and our

345
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,300
volume doubled, right?

346
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,860
So we could call this 2V1.

347
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,180
Our volume doubled, our pressure
would have gone down,

348
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,010
and we're here.

349
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,330
Right?

350
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,310
That's our state 2.

351
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,660
That's this scenario right
here, after we

352
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,750
blew away the wall.

353
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,030
Now, what we did was not
a quasistatic process.

354
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,170
I can't draw the path here,
because right when I blew away

355
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,260
the wall, all hell broke
loose, and things like

356
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,380
pressure and volume weren't
well defined.

357
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,680
Eventually it got back to an
equilibrium where this filled

358
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
the container, and nothing
else was in flux.

359
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,100
And we could go back to here,
and we could say, OK, now the

360
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,270
pressure and the
volume is this.

361
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,680
But we don't know what happened
in between that.

362
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,200
So if we wanted to figure out
our Q/T, or the heat into the

363
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,760
system, we learned in the last
video, the heat added to the

364
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,590
system is equal to the work
done by the system.

365
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,790
We'd be at a loss, because the
work done by the system is the

366
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,450
area under some curve, but
there's no curve to speak of

367
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,710
here, because our system wasn't
defined while all the

368
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,270
hell had broke loose.

369
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,610
So what can we do?

370
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,350
Well, remember, this is
a state function.

371
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,610
And this is a state function.

372
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,040
And I showed that in
the last video.

373
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,530
So it shouldn't be dependent
on how we got

374
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,090
from there to there.

375
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:02,840
Right?

376
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,375
So this change in entropy--
actually, let me be careful

377
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,130
with my words.

378
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:16,030
This change in s, so s2 minus
s1, should be independent of

379
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,090
the process that got
me from s1 to s2.

380
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,410
So this is independent of
whatever crazy path-- I mean,

381
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,160
I could have taken some
crazy, quasistatic

382
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,340
path like that, right?

383
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,910
So any path that goes from this
s1 to this s2 will have

384
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,370
the same heat going into the
system, or should have the

385
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,180
same-- let me take that--

386
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,480
Any system that goes from s1 to
s2, regardless of its path,

387
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,550
will have the same change
in entropy, or their

388
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,680
same change in s.

389
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,250
Because their s was something
here, and it's something

390
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,480
different over here.

391
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,500
And you just take the difference
between the two.

392
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,670
So what's a system that we
know that can do that?

393
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,790
Well, let's say that we
did an isothermal.

394
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,440
And we know that these are all
the same isotherm, right?

395
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
We know that the temperature
didn't change.

396
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,109
I told you that.

397
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,760
Because no kinetic energy was
expended, and none of the

398
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
particles did any work.

399
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,390
So we can say, we can think of a
theoretical process in which

400
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,290
instead of doing something like
that, we could have had a

401
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,050
situation where we started off
with our original container

402
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,260
with our molecules in it.

403
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,890
We could have put a reservoir
here that's equivalent to the

404
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,370
temperature that we're at.

405
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,360
And then this could have been
a piston that was maybe, we

406
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,640
were pushing on it with some
rocks that are pushing in the

407
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,850
left-wards direction.

408
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,840
And we slowly and slowly remove
the rocks, so that

409
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,140
these gases could push the
piston and do some work, and

410
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,760
fill this entire volume,
or twice the volume.

411
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,650
And then the temperature would
have been kept constant by

412
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,240
this heat reservoir.

413
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,470
So this type of a process is
kind of a sideways version of

414
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,250
what I've done in the Carnot
diagrams. That would be

415
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,660
described like this.

416
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,820
You'd go from this state to that
state, and it would be a

417
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,106
quasistatic static process
along an isotherm.

418
00:18:09,106 --> 00:18:10,400
So it would look like that.

419
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,280
So you could have
a curve there.

420
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,430
Now, for that process,
what is the area

421
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,330
under the curve there?

422
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,240
Well, the area under the curve
is just the integral-- and

423
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,950
we've done this multiple times--
from our initial

424
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:35,280
volume to our second volume,
which is twice it, of p times

425
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,840
our change in volume, right?

426
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,100
p is our height, times our
little changes in volume, give

427
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,030
us each rectangle.

428
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,750
And then the integral is just
the sum along all of these.

429
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,580
So that's essentially the work
that this system does.

430
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,110
Right?

431
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,690
And the work that this system
does, since we are on an

432
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,570
isotherm, it is equal to the
heat added to the system.

433
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,610
Because our internal energy
didn't change.

434
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,490
So what is this?

435
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,860
We've done this multiple times,
but I'll redo it.

436
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,140
So this is equal to the
integral of V1 to 2V1.

437
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,820
PV equals NRT, right?

438
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,010
NRT.

439
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,970
So P is equal to NRT/V.

440
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,150
NRT over V dv.

441
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,690
And the t is T1.

442
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,340
Now, all of this is happening
along an isotherm, so all of

443
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,770
these terms are constant.

444
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,920
So this is equal to the integral
from V1 to 2V1 of

445
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,610
NRT1 times 1 over V dv.

446
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,130
I've done this integral
multiple times.

447
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,870
And so this is equal to-- I'll
skip a couple of steps here,

448
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,140
because I've done it in several
videos already-- the

449
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,180
natural log of 2V1
over V1, right?

450
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,100
The antiderivative of this
is the natural log.

451
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,620
Take the natural log of that
minus the natural log of that,

452
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,100
which is equal to the natural
log of 2V1 over V1.

453
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,630
Which is just the same thing
as NRT1 times the

454
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,190
natural log of 2.

455
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,470
Interesting.

456
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,530
Now, let's add one little one
little interesting thing to

457
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,280
this to this equation.

458
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,460
So this is NRT, but if I wanted
to write in terms of

459
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,930
the number of molecules, N
is the number of moles.

460
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:21,470
So I could rewrite N as the
number of molecules we have

461
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,870
divided by, 6 times 10
to the 23 power.

462
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,660
Right?

463
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,710
That's what n could
be written as.

464
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,260
So if we do it that way, then
what is our-- remember, all of

465
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,040
this, we were trying to
find the amount of

466
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,470
work done by our system.

467
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,840
Right?

468
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,290
But if we do it this way,
this equation will turn

469
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,050
into-- so let's see.

470
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,810
The work done by our system--
this is our quasistatic

471
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:51,500
processes that's going from this
state to that state, but

472
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,800
it's doing it in a quasistatic
way, so that we can get an

473
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,020
area under the curve.

474
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,810
So the work done by this
system is equal to--

475
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,560
I'll just write it.

476
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:08,190
N times R over 6 times 10
to the 23, times T1

477
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,460
natural log of 2.

478
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,560
Fair enough.

479
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,140
Let's make this into
some new constant.

480
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,000
For convenience, let me
call it a lowercase k.

481
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,830
So the work we did is equal to
the number of particles we

482
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,170
had, times some new constant--
we'll call that Boltzmann

483
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,920
constant, so it's really
just 8 divided by that.

484
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,270
Times T1, times the
natural log of 2.

485
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,990
Fair enough.

486
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,740
Now, that's only in
this situation.

487
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,230
The other situation did
no work, right?

488
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,930
So I can't talk about this
system doing any work.

489
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,860
But this system did
do some work.

490
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,270
And since it did it along an
isotherm, delta-- the change

491
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,410
in internal energy is equal to
0, so the change in internal

492
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,580
energy, which is equal to the
heat applied to the system

493
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,390
minus the work done by the
system-- this is going to be

494
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,760
equal to 0, since our
temperature didn't change.

495
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,440
So the work is going to
be equal to the heat

496
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,970
added to the system.

497
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,550
So the heat added to the system
by our little reservoir

498
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,050
there is going to be-- so the
heat is going to be the number

499
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,310
of particles we had times
Boltzmann constant, times our

500
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,200
temperature that we're on
the isotherm, times the

501
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,090
natural log of 2.

502
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,060
And all this is a byproduct
of the fact that

503
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,900
we doubled our volume.

504
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,560
Now, in the last video, I
defined change in s as equal

505
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,550
to Q divided by the heat
added, divided by the

506
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,570
temperature at which
I'm adding it.

507
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,790
So for this system, this
quasistatic system, what was

508
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,160
the change in s?

509
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,750
How much did our s-term,
our s-state, change by?

510
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,060
So change in s is equal to
heat added divided by our

511
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,340
temperature.

512
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,590
Our temperature is T1, so that's
equal to this thing.

513
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:02,920
Nk T1 times the natural log
of 2, all of that over T1.

514
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,050
So our delta-- these
cancel out.

515
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:12,170
And our change in our s-quantity
is equal to Nk

516
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,360
times the natural log of 2.

517
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,720
Now, you should be starting to
experience an a-ha moment.

518
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,500
When we defined in the previous
video, we were just

519
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,720
playing with thermodynamics, and
we said, gee, we'd really

520
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,380
like to have a state variable
that deals with heat, and we

521
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,040
just made up this thing right
here that said, change in that

522
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,350
state variable is equal to the
heat applied to the system

523
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,320
divided by the temperature at
which the heat was applied.

524
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,550
And when we use that definition
the change in our

525
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,910
s-value from this position
to this position, for a

526
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,290
quasi-static process,
ended up being this.

527
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,870
Nk natural log of 2.

528
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,100
Now, this is a state function.

529
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,050
State variable.

530
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,000
It's not dependent
on the path.

531
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,720
So any process that gets from
here, that gets from this

532
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,320
point to that point, has to
have the same change in s.

533
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,190
So the delta s for any process
is going to be equal to that

534
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,720
same value, which was N, in
this case, k, times the

535
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,090
natural log of 2.

536
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,610
Any system, by our definition,
right?

537
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,380
It's the state variable.

538
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,120
I don't care whether it
disappeared, or the path was

539
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,390
some crazy path.

540
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,715
It's a state.

541
00:24:22,715 --> 00:24:26,260
It's only a function of that and
of that, our change in s.

542
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,410
So given that, even this
system-- we said that this

543
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,520
system that we started the video
out with, it started off

544
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,920
at this same V1, and it
got to the same V2.

545
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,670
So by the definition of the
previous video, by this

546
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,550
definition, its change in s is
going to be the number of

547
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,880
molecules times some constant
times the natural log of 2.

548
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,590
Now, that's the same exact
result we got when we thought

549
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,050
about it from a statistical
point of view, when we were

550
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:59,170
saying, how many more different
states can the

551
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,330
system take on?

552
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,980
And what's mind-blowing here
is that what we started off

553
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,560
with was just kind of a nice,
you know, macrostate in our

554
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,850
little Carnot engine world,
that we didn't really know

555
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,760
what it meant.

556
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,000
But we got the same exact result
that when we try to do

557
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,110
it from a measuring the
number of states the

558
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,670
system could take on.

559
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:23,590
So all of this has been a long,
two-video-winded version

560
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,210
of an introduction to entropy.

561
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,530
   

562
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,660
And in thermodynamics, a change
in entropy-- entropy is

563
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,180
s, or I think of it, s for
states-- the thermodynamic, or

564
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,840
Carnot cycle, or Carnot engine
world, is defined as the

565
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,740
change in entropy is defined
as the heat added to the

566
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,230
system divided by the
temperature at

567
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,510
which it was added.

568
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,410
Now, in our statistical
mechanics world, we can define

569
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:59,350
entropy as some constant-- and
it's especially convenient,

570
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,540
this is Boltzmann's constant--
some constant times the

571
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,080
natural log of the number of
states we have. Sometimes it's

572
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,110
written as omega, sometimes
other things.

573
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,450
But this time, it's the number
of states we have.

574
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,150
And what just showed in this
video is, these are equivalent

575
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,910
definitions.

576
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:18,030
or.

577
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,020
At least for that one case
I just showed you.

578
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,490
These are equivalent
definitions.

579
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,580
When we used the number of
states for this, how much did

580
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,630
it increase, we got
this result.

581
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,400
And then when we used the
thermodynamic definition of

582
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,290
it, we got that same result.

583
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,940
And if we assume that this
constant is the same as that

584
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,610
constant, if they're both
Boltzmann's constant, both 1.3

585
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,610
times 10 to the minus 23,
then our definitions are

586
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,540
equivalent.

587
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,990
And so the intuition of
entropy-- in the last one, we

588
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,940
were kind of struggling
with that.

589
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,730
We just defined it this way,
but we were like, what does

590
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,990
that really mean?

591
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,630
What change in entropy means,
is just how many more states

592
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,640
can the system take on?

593
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,310
You know, sometimes when you
learn it in your high school

594
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,910
chemistry class, they'll
call it disorder.

595
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,400
And it is disorder.

596
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,600
But I don't want you to think
that somehow, you know, a

597
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,950
messy room has higher entropy
than a clean room, which some

598
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,800
people sometimes use
as an example.

599
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,070
That's not the case.

600
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,100
What you should say is, is that
a stadium full of people

601
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,010
has more states than a stadium
without people in it.

602
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,690
That has more entropy.

603
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,640
Or actually, I should even
be careful there.

604
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,590
Let me say, a stadium at a
high temperature has more

605
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,180
entropy than the inside
of my refrigerator.

606
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,630
That the particles in that
stadium have more potential

607
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,910
states than the particles
in my refrigerator.

608
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,610
Now I'm going to leave you
there, and we're going to take

609
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,200
our definitions here, which I
think are pretty profound--

610
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,650
this and this is the same
definition-- and we're going

611
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,360
to apply that to talk about
the second law of

612
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:54,960
thermodynamics.

613
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,100
And actually, just
a little aside.

614
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:02,940
I wrote omega here, but in our
example, this was 2 to the N.

615
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,200
And so that's why
it's simplified.

616
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:13,450
This was x the first time, and
then the second time, when we

617
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,340
double the size of our room, or
our volume, it was x to the

618
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,350
N times 2 to N.

619
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,420
I just want to make sure you
realize what omega relates to,

620
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,350
relative to what I just
went through.

621
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,500
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
