1
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:10,533
We're in the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and we're looking at Rosa Bonheur's

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,849
light filled painting called 'Plowing in the Nivernais.'

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:21,517
That refers to both the region and the kind of oxen that are the stars of this canvas.

4
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:26,217
They are. The human figure that pushes them along is hardly important.

5
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,871
So Rosa Bonheur did some extraordinary things.

6
00:00:28,871 --> 00:00:31,449
She was an incredibly precocious girl.

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:36,317
I think it was at age fourteen that she was actually sketching in the Louvre and actually creating oil paintings.

8
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:40,481
This was possible because her father was an artist and had really encouraged her.

9
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:41,951
I think that they were very liberal.

10
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:46,496
Otherwise she would not have had her enormous artistic talent encouraged.

11
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:48,964
She might not've ended up a painter at all.

12
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:53,951
So this was made in 1849 which is just one year after the revolution

13
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:57,723
and so interesting that an artist now is moving out into the countryside,

14
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,853
away from all of the chaos of the city --

15
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,223
Where the revolution happened--

16
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:06,275
And we have this incredible image of these oxen turning the soil in the fall to

17
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:11,167
prepare it for the following year's season and look at the soil itself.

18
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,881
You almost get the sense that here's the strength of France.

19
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:21,837
The earth looks incredibly rich and fertile. So there is a sense of a kind of nationalistic idea

20
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:27,343
of the French countryside and that France will survive and indeed thrive.

21
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:32,277
And those oxen are so powerful and so beautiful and, in a sense, so eternal.

22
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:35,214
You know, this is a ritual that has gone on long before the politics

23
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,587
of the modern world.

24
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:42,859
And will continue long after. They come forward in a receding diagonal that moves into our space

25
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:46,663
so that we have this sense of depth and atmospheric perspective

26
00:01:46,663 --> 00:01:54,456
and sense of weather and the warmth of the sunlight... It's really so particularly and carefully observed

27
00:01:54,456 --> 00:02:00,121
and it reminds me so much that we see of the 1840s and then into the 1850s of this interest

28
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:06,737
in rural life, of laborers, of the virtues of the countryside.

29
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:11,992
Yeah, when I look at this, the oxen, those backs are so beautifully aligned, they almost

30
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:18,040
create their own horizon like the hills beside them and so, in a sense, they are the earth itself.

31
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,772
There is this sense of permanence. I think throughout the 1840s, especially with the kind of industrialization

32
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:29,389
and growth of the cities that's taking places that there is this real desire to return to

33
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,414
this much more basic truth.

34
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:34,355
Which resides in nature and the countryside.

35
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:39,555
And in labor itself but in a kind of simple, very direct kind of labor.

36
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:45,349
So do you think that Rosa Bonheur is giving us a conservative vision at this moment just after

37
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:51,992
a very radical revolution of 1848 that brings the working class into power in a significant way?

38
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:56,392
I think that there are conservative aspects here but it's more complicated than that.

39
00:02:56,392 --> 00:03:02,125
She's breaking too many boundaries. She's emphasizing the importance of landscape,

40
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,310
of animal painting itself, on a scale that is often reserved for history painting.

41
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,900
She's a woman not painting interiors, not painting as an amateur but is painting

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,972
at the level of the highest professional. These are radical ideas and I don't think that we can see this

43
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,105
as conservative painting.

44
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,642
And really remarkable accomplishments.
