1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,170
The fading light of the sun is being

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,538
replaced by the lanterns being held by these children

3
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:15,147
it's that moment at twilight when artificial light

4
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:19,803
just begins to assert itself against the light of the day

5
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:22,922
It is a wonderful and haunting part of the day, and Sargent

6
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:28,755
captured it in his painting, Carnation Lily, Lily, Rose

7
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:31,437
from 1885-6. You know that title

8
00:00:31,437 --> 00:00:35,348
was pretty poetic, and the repetition in the title really gives us a

9
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:39,080
sense of the idea of repetition of form and light throughout this

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,002
painting. Look at the way the Japanese lanterns move from left to

11
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,422
right across the middle of this canvas. Forming a

12
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:49,914
curving arabesque across the center. They're almost like the notes that you would find

13
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:53,600
in a musical score, and we do read across but of course our eye

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,149
also stops because there's so much that's beautiful to look at here.

15
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:01,233
All we have is this really lush, rich surface.

16
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:05,604
There's nobody that moves paint across the surface of the canvas like Sargent,

17
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:09,269
and look how he's just moved that brush across the surface

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,914
in rendering those roses, or the carnations down towards the bottom

19
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:16,835
or even the ridges of the lanterns themselves, and the way in which those blue

20
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:21,707
shadows play against the beautiful warm illumination from within.

21
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,239
It's interesting because the parts of a painting that you would expect

22
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,413
to be illuminated are not. Everything is

23
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:33,096
drenched in dusk. You look to the faces of the children

24
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:37,084
for where they would be illuminated, where you might see the expression

25
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:40,965
on a child's face, but he hasn't concentrated his attention there.

26
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:46,769
His attention is dispersed across this decorative surface. The parts that are illuminated are these

27
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,263
lanterns against this graying, green forms of

28
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:54,071
dusk. Look at the way the canvas is really flat; clearly, the influence

29
00:01:54,071 --> 00:01:58,133
of Japanese prints. The way in which, for instance, the flowers are smallest

30
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:02,206
at the feet of the children, and then as we move up to those large lilies

31
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,934
they rise, and that's directly in opposition to the way

32
00:02:04,934 --> 00:02:09,220
paintings would normally be constructed. It has the effect of

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,133
making the background come forward. So there is a conflation of

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,165
nature, and childhood, and innocence

35
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:19,869
and all of those things coming together, it's just lovely. And so nineteenth century.

36
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:24,533
So we have a painting that lacks any kind of a real subject

37
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,891
except for the quality of light

38
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:32,637
and color harmonies, these greens, and peaches, and pinks and whites.

39
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:36,700
We see this in British painting the last half of the nineteenth century

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,523
with artists like Albert Moore, where the subject of the painting is the color harmony

41
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,585
art for art's sake. This is well into this movement that we know as

42
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:48,722
aestheticism, which removes all of the literary, all of the weighty

43
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:52,086
subjects of history, and really make the painting and the beauty of the painting

44
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:58,255
its main focus. And the formal qualities of the painting, like shapes, patterns, colors

45
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,752
those are the things that become most

46
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:03,636
important. We could think about artists also like Whistler.

47
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:08,105
And it's easy to see how this becomes important for the beginnings of Abstraction. Looking at

48
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,153
art not for what it's representing, not for the objects

49
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:17,438
it's copying from the world, but for the things that art is made up of itself.

50
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,720
Sargent actually painted this plein air,

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,865
that is he painted it in a garden. So he was also very interested

52
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:27,416
in a tonal accuracy, an accuracy of form, even if in fact

53
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,084
ultimately the painting is about painting.

54
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:34,700
Apparently, this was a bit of a frustration, you know painting outside with models is not an easy thing,

55
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,647
especially when you've got children, and dusk is such a fleeting moment.

56
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:42,805
One can imagine him, in England, in this garden, really trying to keep everybody's

57
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:46,650
attention, making sure that the weather is right, making sure that the light is just

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,504
right, and trying to get all of this down.

59
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:54,298
The children are really concentrating on the lighting of their lanterns.

60
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:59,039
Their thoughtfulness draws us in, and allows us to linger

61
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,535
over all of the beautiful, visual lushness

62
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:05,142
that the artist has given us.
