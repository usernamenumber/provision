1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,360
In the last video, I showed you
what a neuron looked like

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,790
and we talked about the
different parts of a neuron,

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,480
and I gave you the general
idea what a neuron does.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,270
It gets stimulated at the
dendrites-- and the

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,730
stimulation we'll talk about
in future videos on what

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,480
exactly that means-- and
that that impulse, that

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,450
information, that signal
gets added up.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,480
If there's multiple stimulation
points on various

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,660
dendrites, it gets added up and
if it meets some threshold

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,310
level, it's going to create
this action potential or

12
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:34,380
signal that travels across the
axon and maybe stimulates

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,550
other neurons or muscles because
these terminal points

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,280
of the axons might be connected
to dendrites of

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,550
other neurons or to muscle
cells or who knows what.

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,690
But what I want to do in this
video is kind of lay the

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,100
building blocks for exactly
what this signal is or how

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,350
does a neuron actually transmit
this information

19
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,980
across the axon-- or really,
how does it go from the

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,630
dendrite all the way
to the axon?

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,960
Before I actually even talk
about that, we need to kind of

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,400
lay the ground rules-- or a
ground understanding of the

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,120
actual voltage potential
across the

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,060
membrane of a neuron.

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,070
And, actually, all cells have
some voltage potential

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,660
difference, but it's especially
relevant when we

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,110
talk about a neuron and its
ability to send signals.

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,745
Let's zoom in on a
neuron's cell.

29
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:25,580
   

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,870
I could zoom in on any point
on this cell that's not

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,410
covered by a myelin sheath.

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm going to zoom in
on its membrane.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,470
So let's say that this is
the membrane of the

34
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,260
neuron, just like that.

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,060
That's the membrane.

36
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,970
This is outside the neuron
or the cell.

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,730
And then this is inside the
neuron or the cell.

38
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,220
Now, you have sodium
and potassium

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,370
ions floating around.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm going to draw sodium
like this.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,900
Sodium's going to be a circle.

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,770
So that's sodium and their
positively charged ions have a

43
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,840
plus one charge and then
potassium, I'll draw them as

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,340
little triangles.

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,150
So let's say that's potassium--
symbol for

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,320
potassium is K.

47
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,190
It's also positively charged.

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,710
And you have them just
lying around.

49
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,340
Let's say we start off
both inside and

50
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,230
outside of the cell.

51
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:38,550
   

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,910
They're all positively
charged.

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,800
Sodium inside, some
sodium outside.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,010
Now it turns out that cells
have more positive charge

55
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,130
outside of their membranes than

56
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,410
inside of their membranes.

57
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,830
So there's actually a potential
difference that if

58
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,450
the membrane wasn't there,
negative charges would want to

59
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,380
escape or positive charges
or positive ions

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,130
would want to get in.

61
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,620
The outside ends up being more
positive, and we're going to

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,870
talk about why.

63
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,140
   

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,480
So this is an electrical
potential gradient, right?

65
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,300
If this is less positive than
that-- if I have a positive

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,790
charge here, it's going to
want to go to the less

67
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,540
positive side.

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,820
It's going to want to
go away from the

69
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,870
other positive charges.

70
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,310
It's repelled by the other
positive charges.

71
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,610
Likewise, if I had a negative
charge here, it'd want to go

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,290
the other side-- or a positive
charge, I guess, would be

73
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,530
happier being here
than over here.

74
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,160
But the question is, how
does that happen?

75
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,570
Because left to their own
devices, the charges would

76
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,840
disperse so you wouldn't have
this potential gradient.

77
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,910
Somehow we have to put energy
into the system in order to

78
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,860
produce this state where we
have more positive on the

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,070
charge of the outside than
we do on the inside.

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,530
And that's done by sodium
potassium pumps.

81
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,560
I'm going to draw then
a certain way.

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,810
This is obviously not how the
protein actually looks, but

83
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,870
it'll give you a sense of how it
actually pumps things out.

84
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,700
   

85
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,230
I'll draw that side
of the protein.

86
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,760
Maybe it looks like this and
you'll have a sense of why I

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,050
drew it like this.

88
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,010
So that side of the protein or
the enzyme-- and then the

89
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,640
other side, I'll draw
it like this.

90
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,380
It looks something like this,
and of course the real protein

91
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,250
doesn't look like this.

92
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,510
You've seen me show you what
proteins really look like.

93
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,620
They look like big clusters
of things, hugely complex.

94
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,570
Different parts of the proteins
can bond to different

95
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,150
things and when things bond to
proteins, they change shape.

96
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,565
But I'm doing a very simple
diagram here and what I want

97
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:37,170
to show you is, this is our
sodium potassium pump in its

98
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,580
inactivated state.

99
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,680
And what happens in this
situation is that we have

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,290
these nice places where our
sodium can bind to.

101
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,940
So in this situation, sodium can
bind to these locations on

102
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,320
our enzyme or on our protein.

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,470
And if we just had the sodiums
bind and we didn't have any

104
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,070
energy going into the system,
nothing would happen.

105
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,270
It would just stay in
this situation.

106
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,650
The actual protein might look
like something crazy.

107
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,290
The actual protein might be this
big cloud of protein and

108
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,200
then your sodiums bond there,
there, and there.

109
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,940
Maybe it's inside the protein
somehow, but still, nothing's

110
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,500
going to happen just when the
sodium bonds on this side of

111
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,670
the protein.

112
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,730
In order for it to do anything,
in order for it to

113
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,490
pump anything out, it uses
the energy from ATP.

114
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,580
So we had all those videos on
respiration and I told you

115
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,530
that ATP was the currency of
energy in the cell-- well,

116
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,030
this is something useful
for ATP to do.

117
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:38,280
ATP-- that's adenosine
triphosphate-- it might go to

118
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,160
some other part of our enzyme,
but in this diagram maybe it

119
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,220
goes to this part
of the enzyme.

120
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,170
   

121
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,390
And this enzyme, it's
a type of ATPase.

122
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,760
When I say ATPase, it breaks off
a phosphate from the ATP--

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,410
and that's just by virtue
of its shape.

124
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,910
It's able to plunk it off.

125
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,270
When it plunks off the
phosphate, it changes shape.

126
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,320
   

127
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,510
So step one, we have sodium
ions-- and actually, let's

128
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,070
keep count of them.

129
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,310
We have three sodium-- these are
the actual ratios-- three

130
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:23,570
sodium ions from inside the
cell or the neuron.

131
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,330
They bond to pump, which is
really a protein that crosses

132
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,920
our membrane.

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,590
Now, step two, we
have also ATP.

134
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,040
ATP gets broken into ATP plus
phosphate on the actual

135
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,350
protein and that changes
the shape.

136
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:51,635
So that also provides energy
to change pump's shape.

137
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:55,780
   

138
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,430
Now this is when the
pump was before.

139
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,920
Now after, our pump might look
something like this.

140
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,570
Let me clear out some
space right here.

141
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll draw the after
pump right there.

142
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,860
   

143
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,400
And so this is before.

144
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,460
After the phosphate gets split
off of the ATP, it might look

145
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,830
something like this.

146
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,360
Instead of being in that
configuration, it opens in the

147
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,130
other direction.

148
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,420
So now it might look something
like this.

149
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,170
   

150
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,500
And of course it's carrying
these phosphate groups.

151
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,775
They have a positive charge.

152
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,470
   

153
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
It's open like this.

154
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,390
This side now looks like this.

155
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,940
So now the phosphates are
released to the outside.

156
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,300
So they've been pumped
to the outside.

157
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,190
Remember, this is required
energy because it's going

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,870
against the natural gradient.

159
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,290
You're taking positive charge
and you're pushing them to an

160
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,670
environment that is even more
positive and you're also

161
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,740
taking it to an environment
where there's already a lot of

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,625
sodium, and you're putting
more sodium there.

163
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,370
So you're going against the
charge gradient and you're

164
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,980
going against the
sodium gradient.

165
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,550
But now-- I guess we call it
step three-- the sodium gets

166
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,090
released outside the cell.

167
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,350
And when this changes shape,
it's not so good at bonding

168
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,490
with the sodium anymore.

169
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,660
So maybe these can become a
little bit different too, so

170
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,410
that the sodium can't even bond
in this configuration now

171
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,080
that the protein has changed
shape due to the ATP.

172
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,110
So step three, the three Na
plusses, sodium ions-- are

173
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,590
released outside.

174
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,700
   

175
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,760
Now once it's in this
configuration, we have all

176
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,820
these positive ions out here.

177
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,480
These positive ions want to get
really as far away from

178
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,240
each other as possible.

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,320
They'd actually probably be
attracted to the cell itself

180
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,820
because the cell is less
positive on the inside.

181
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,590
So these positive ions-- and in
particular, the potassium--

182
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,170
can bond this side of the
protein when it's in this-- I

183
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,550
guess we could call it this
activated configuration.

184
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,570
So now, I guess we could
call it step four.

185
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,400
   

186
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,260
We have two sodium ions bond
to-- I guess we could call it

187
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,680
the activated pump--
or changed pump.

188
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,320
Or maybe we could say it's
in its open form.

189
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,930
So they come here and when they
bond, it re-changes the

190
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,430
shape of this protein back
to this shape, back

191
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,590
to that open shape.

192
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,660
Now when it goes back to the
open shape, these guys aren't

193
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,510
here anymore, but we have these
two guys sitting here

194
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,930
and in this shape right here,
all of a sudden these divots--

195
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,660
maybe they're not divots.

196
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,860
They're actually things in this
big cluster of protein.

197
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,230
They're not as good at staying
bonded or holding onto these

198
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,290
sodiums so these sodiums get
released into the cell.

199
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,310
So step five, the pump-- this
changes shape of pump.

200
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,636
So pump changes shape
to original.

201
00:09:56,636 --> 00:10:05,200
   

202
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,220
And then once we're in the
original, those two sodium

203
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,920
ions released inside the cell.

204
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,990
We're going to see in the next
few videos why it's useful to

205
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,690
have those sodium ions
on the inside.

206
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,360
You might say, well, why don't
we just keep pumping things on

207
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,420
the outside in order to have
a potential difference?

208
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,500
But we'll see these
sodium ions are

209
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,620
actually also very useful.

210
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,870
So what's the net effect
that's going on?

211
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,930
We end up with a lot more sodium
ions on the outside and

212
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,420
we end up with more potassium
ions on the inside, but I told

213
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,940
you that the inside is less
positive than the outside.

214
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,300
But these are both positive.

215
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,850
I don't care if I have more
potassium or sodium, but if

216
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,760
you paid attention to the ratios
I talked about, every

217
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,290
time we use an ATP, we're
pumping out three sodiums and

218
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,860
we're only pumping in two
potassiums, right?

219
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,880
We pumped out three sodiums and
two potassiums. Each of

220
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,610
them have a plus-1 charge, but
every time we do this, we're

221
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,960
adding a net-1 charge to
the outside, right?

222
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,910
3 on the outside,
2 to the inside.

223
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,560
We have a net-1 charge-- we have
a plus-1 to the outside.

224
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,770
So we're making the outside
more positive, especially

225
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,520
relative to the inside.

226
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,840
And this is what creates that
potential difference.

227
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,000
If you actually took a
voltmeter-- a voltmeter

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,770
measures electrical potential
difference-- and you took the

229
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,800
voltage difference between that
point and this point-- or

230
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
more specifically, between this
point and that point, if

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,310
you were to subtract the voltage
here from the voltage

232
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,710
there, you will get -70
millivolts, which is generally

233
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,650
considered the resting voltage
difference, the potential

234
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,910
difference across the membrane
of a neuron when it's in its

235
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,010
resting state.

236
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,180
So in this video, I kind of laid
out the foundation of why

237
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,190
and how a cell using ATP,
using energy, is able to

238
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,290
maintain a potential difference
across its membrane

239
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,490
where the outside is slightly
more positive than the inside.

240
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,540
So we actually have a negative
potential difference if we're

241
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,810
comparing the inside
to the outside.

242
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,260
Positive charge would want to
move in if they were allowed

243
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,880
to, and negative charge would
want to move out if it was

244
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,030
allowed to.

245
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,680
Now there might be one
last question.

246
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,380
You might say, well, if we just
kept adding charge out

247
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,930
here, our voltage difference
would get really negative.

248
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,290
This would be much more negative
than the outside.

249
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,030
Why does it stabilize at -70?

250
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,240
To answer that question-- these
are going to come into

251
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,550
play in a lot more detail in
future videos-- you also have

252
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,530
channels, which are really
protein structures that in

253
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,740
their open position will allow
sodium to go through them.

254
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,550
And there are also channels
that are in their open

255
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,120
position, would allow potassium
to go through them.

256
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,020
I'm drawing it in their
closed position.

257
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,890
And we're going to talk in the
next video about what happens

258
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,940
when they open.

259
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,700
But in their closed position,
they're still

260
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,950
a little bit leaky.

261
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,530
   

262
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,560
And if, say, the concentration
of potassium becomes too high

263
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,530
down here-- and too high meaning
when they start to

264
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,560
reach this threshold of -70
millivolts-- or even better,

265
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,820
when the sodium gets too high
out there, a few of them will

266
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,680
start to leak down.

267
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,060
When the concentration gets
really high and this is really

268
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,560
positive just because of the
electrical potential, some of

269
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,990
them will just be
shoved through.

270
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,930
So it'll keep us right around
-70 millivolts.

271
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,790
And if we go below, maybe some
of the potassium gets leaked

272
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,580
through the other way.

273
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,240
So even though when these are
shut-- if it becomes too

274
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,150
ridiculous-- if it goes to -80
millivolts or -90 millivolts,

275
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,410
all of a sudden, there'd be a
huge incentive for some of

276
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,700
this stuff to leak through their
respective channels.

277
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,410
So that's what allows
us to stay at that

278
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,550
stable voltage potential.

279
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,500
In the next video, we're going
to see what happens to this

280
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,400
voltage potential when the
neuron is actually stimulated.

281
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,631
