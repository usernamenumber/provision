1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970
   

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,810
It is late and I'm sleepy but I
feel strangely motivated to

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,160
do SAT problems, so I will do
SAT problems. So we'll start a

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,860
new test.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,760
This is going to be test 2, and
we're going to start on

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,750
section 3, and that's
on page 459 of the--

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,010
what's that book called?

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,250
The Official SAT Study Guide
by The College Board.

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,730
So let's get started.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,880
So the first problem,
problem number 1.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,740
It said, if 3b plus 1 is less
than 10, which of the

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,640
following cannot to
be the value of b?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,410
So which of the following cannot
be the value of b?

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,420
And they give a couple of
choices: a, minus 1; b, 0; c,

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,190
1; d, 2; e, 3.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,310
And you could start with choice
a and just keep going

17
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,120
through all of them and inspect
it really fast. The

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,020
way I would do it is I would
automatically convert this

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,180
equation, subtract one
from both sides.

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,900
You say, well, this is the same
thing as 3 times b has to

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,010
be less than 9.

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,050
I just subtracted 1 from both
sides of this, right?

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,950
And if you look at these, well
3 times negative 1, that's

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,330
negative 3, that's
less than 9.

25
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,110
3 times 0, that's 0,
that's less than 9.

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,670
Let me write that.

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,850
3 times negative 1
is negative 3.

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,960
3 times 0 is 0.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,480
3 times 1 is 3, 3
times 2 is 6.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,140
These are all less
than 9, right?

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,370
I just substituted each
of these for b.

32
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,720
But 3 times 3, that is actually
equal to 9, right?

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,760
3 times 3 is equal to 9, which
is not less than 9.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,530
So our choice is e.

35
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,170
Number 2, I think I've space
to do it on this without

36
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,510
having to clear the
chalkboard.

37
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,220
It says, 2 to the 4x
is equal to 16.

38
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,460
Whenever you see one of these
problems where the variable is

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,700
in the exponent and you have
different bases here, the

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,810
trick is really just to convert
them to the same base.

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,479
So can I write 16
as a power of 2?

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,509
Well sure.

43
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,870
Two to the what power is 16?

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,780
Well, 2 to the squared is 4, 2
to the 3rd power is 8, to the

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,830
4th power is 16, right?

46
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,840
So we could write this same
equation as 2 to the 4x is

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,790
equal to, another way of writing
16 is 2 to the 4th

48
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,380
power, right?

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,110
And now, that this should
seem a little bit more

50
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,370
straightforward.

51
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,130
2 to the 4x is the same thing
as 2 to the 4th, so 4x must

52
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,390
equal 4, right?

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:44,470
4x must equal 4, so
x is equal to 1.

54
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,410
And that choice exists, so I
feel confident in my answer.

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,922
Let's move on.

56
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:52,630
I think soon.

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,340
I might be coming down
with the flu.

58
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,290
Let's hope not, because that
would limit my ability to turn

59
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,060
out SAT problems on YouTube.

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,310
Number 3.

61
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,340
   

62
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,920
How much greater is r minus
2 than r plus 5?

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,280
   

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,610
Well, if I wanted to know how
much one number is greater

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,310
than another, if I ask you how
much greater is 10 than 5,

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,230
what do I do?

67
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,890
Well, I take 10 minus 5
and that's my answer.

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,450
So example: 10 minus
5 is 5, so 10 is 5

69
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,320
greater than 5, right?

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,160
So if I want to know how much
greater than r minus 2 is r

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,550
plus 5, right-- and r plus 5
is going to be the greater

72
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,370
one-- you just subtract them.

73
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,270
So we say r plus 5
minus r minus 2.

74
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,930
So r plus 5 minus r-- I'm just
distributing the negative

75
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,505
number-- plus 2.

76
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:59,040
The r's cancel out, and
you get the answer.

77
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,020
It's 7.

78
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,570
And you really didn't even
have to do it this way,

79
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,260
because this r could be any
number, and the answer should

80
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,550
be the same no matter
what r is.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,730
And obviously it worked out
because the r's canceled out.

82
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,410
The easiest thing, let me just
assume that r is 0 because we

83
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,060
can, because it shouldn't
matter what r is.

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:27,890
If r was 0, then the question
is how much greater than

85
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,970
negative 2 is plus 5, right?

86
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,440
I just assumed that r was 0.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,540
And then you would do
the same thing.

88
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,950
You would do 5 minus negative
2, which is equal to 7.

89
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,060
And you could draw them on the
number line if you wanted to

90
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,270
visually approach
this problem.

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,480
All right, this next problem
looks visual.

92
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,910
   

93
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,810
Problem number 4.

94
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,300
OK, so it has a square.

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,770
I don't need to draw it fancy,
let me just draw it freehand.

96
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,900
So, it's a box, it
looks like this.

97
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:14,970
   

98
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,200
They say that the box
is open at the top.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,330
   

100
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,745
So that's the bottom
right there.

101
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:25,380
   

102
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,630
OK, and they give
measurements.

103
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,690
This end is 4, this end is 3,
and then the height is 2.

104
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,170
And they were to say if we were
to essentially cut the

105
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,620
sides of this box and flatten
it all out, which of these

106
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,410
choices are that this
box-- this is a pure

107
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,370
visualization problem.

108
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,530
But to flatten it out,
as I said, you would

109
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,610
cut you this line.

110
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,070
You'd cut this line.

111
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm just imagining
what I would do

112
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,230
if I had some scissors.

113
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,260
And there's no top to
the box, right?

114
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,360
And then I would take this side
and I would flatten it

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,980
out that way.

116
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,735
This side, I would flatten
it out that way.

117
00:05:57,735 --> 00:06:00,880
That back side, I would flatten
it out there, and that

118
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,740
side, I would flatten
it out there.

119
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,060
So you'd have the base.

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:14,435
The base would look like this
where you have 3 would be the

121
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:16,120
width, right?

122
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,820
This side corresponds
to this side, right?

123
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,220
This side would correspond
to this side.

124
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,970
And that would be of length 4.

125
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,300
And then this height 2--
let me draw that.

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,610
So this flap, which I
draw in brown, would

127
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,860
come out like this.

128
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,420
   

129
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,890
And this distance right
here would be 2.

130
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,810
And then you would have
another-- let's say, the flap

131
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,440
in the back.

132
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,650
Let me draw it in another
color, in a dark purple.

133
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,000
This flap in the back would
come out like this, flat.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,410
It would also have 2 length.

135
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,220
And then the other 2 flaps,
like this one, would

136
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,470
come out like this.

137
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,004
   

138
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:16,130
And of course this has 2 here.

139
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,630
And then finally I have
that flap in the back.

140
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,750
I need to pick a color.

141
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,330
This flap in the back would
come out like that, right?

142
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,900
And I'll shade it in
like I shaded in

143
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,150
the original picture.

144
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,090
And that would also have 2.

145
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,370
So this is a pure visualization
problem, there's

146
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,340
not a lot more that I can
do to explain this.

147
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,550
And there's no top
to this box.

148
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,220
And we had a bottom.

149
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,030
So this is the choice.

150
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,770
See, if we rotated it around a
little bit, it's choice e.

151
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,350
Actually rotated it around,
because choice

152
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,580
e looks like this.

153
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:59,780
Choice e looks like this.

154
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm not drawing it that
well, but it looks

155
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,280
something like this.

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,120
Where they say that this length
is 4, this length is 2,

157
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,320
and this length is 3.

158
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,500
So they took this and they
essentially rotated it so that

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,390
this side becomes this side.

160
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,630
And then this side becomes
that side.

161
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,990
So they just rotated
it clockwise a

162
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,550
little over 90 degrees.

163
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,670
And that's how they
got that answer.

164
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,670
So this is a pure visualization
problem.

165
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,020
With that, I have about 90
seconds left in this video, so

166
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,659
I'll wait to do it in
the next video.

167
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,110
I'll see

168
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,933
