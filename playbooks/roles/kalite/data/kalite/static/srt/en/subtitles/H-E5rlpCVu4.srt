1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,875
Let's say we have two lines over here.

2
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:02,816
Let's call this line right over here line AB.

3
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:08,783
So A and B both sit on this line.

4
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:10,370
And let's say we have this other line over here.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,437
We'll call this line CD.

6
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:18,301
So it goes through point C and it goes through point D and it just keeps on going forever.

7
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:27,014
Now let's say that these lines both sit on the same plane and in this case the plane is our screen or this little piece of paper we're looking at right over here.

8
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:36,110
And they never intersect! They never intersect. So they're on the same plane but they never intersect each other.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,703
If those two things are true, their not the same line, they never intersect, they can be on the same

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:48,916
plane, then we say that these lines are parallel.

11
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:53,904
They are moving in the same general direction, in fact the exact same general direction, if we are looking at it from

12
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:57,034
an algebraic point of view, we would say they have the same slope,

13
00:00:57,034 --> 00:01:01,307
but they have different intersect, they involve different points.

14
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:07,630
If we do accorded axes here they would intersect that in a different point but they would have the same exact slope.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,140
What I want to do is think how angles relate to paralel lines.

16
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,832
So right over here we have this two paralel lines.

17
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:22,836
We can say that line AB is paralel to line CD

18
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:27,978
Sometimes you'll see it specified on geometric drawings like this.

19
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:31,507
I'll put a little arrow here to show that this two lines are paralel

20
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:34,167
and if you already used the single arrow then you might put a double arrow

21
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:38,301
to show that this line is paralel to that line right over there.

22
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:44,700
Now what I want to do is draw a line that intersects both of this paralel lines.

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,574
So here's a line that intersects both of them. Let me draw it a bit near than that.

24
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:59,368
And I'll just call that line "L".

25
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,106
And this line that intersects both of this paralel lines

26
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,568
we call that a transversal. This is a transversal line.

27
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:12,298
It's transversing both of this paralel lines.

28
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,483
And what I want to think about is the angles that are formed

29
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,303
and how they relate to each other.

30
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,150
The angles that are formed at intersection between this transversal line

31
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,961
and the two paralel lines.

32
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:27,088
So we can first of all start of this angle right over here.

33
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,419
That angle right over there we can call that angle...

34
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,953
well if we make some labels here that would be D, this point and then something else

35
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,642
but I'll just call of this angle right over here.

36
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:38,927
We know that this is going to be equal to it's vertical angle.

37
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,795
So this angle is vertical with that one,

38
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,353
so it's going to be equal to that angle right over there.

39
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,834
We also know that this angle here is going to be equal to the angle that is it's vertical angle

40
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:56,172
or the angle that is opposite the intersection so it's going to be equal to that.

41
00:02:56,172 --> 00:03:00,673
And sometimes you will see it specified like this, you will see a double angle mark like that

42
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:02,647
or sometimes you will see someone write this

43
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:07,504
to show that this two are equal and this two are equal right over here.

44
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:10,827
Now the other thing we know is we can do the exact same exersise up here -

45
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:14,966
this two are gonna be equal to each other and this two are gonna be equal to each other.

46
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,499
They are all vertical angles.

47
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:21,866
What's interesting here is thinking about the relationship between this angle

48
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:29,444
right over here and this angle right up over there.

49
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:33,561
And if you just look at it it's actually obvious what that relationship is.

50
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:37,240
They are going to be the same exact angle.

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,637
And if you put a protractor here and measure it you'd get the exact same measure up here.

52
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:46,809
And if i drew parallel lines, maybe I'll draw it straight left and right, it might be a little bit ore obvious

53
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:51,557
so if I assume that these two lines are parallel and I have a transversal here

54
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:57,651
what I'm saying is this angle is going to be the exact same measure as that angle there.

55
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,853
And to visualize that, just imagine tilting this line, and as you take different,

56
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:07,227
so it looks like its the case over there, if you take the line like this and you look at it over here,

57
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:10,470
it's clear that this is equal to this and there's actually no proof for this.

58
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,407
This is one of those things that a mathematician would say intuitively obvious.

59
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:19,873
That if you look at it, as you tilt these lines, you would say that these angles are the same.

60
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:23,445
Or think about putting a protractor here to actually measure these angles.

61
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:31,385
If you put a protractor here, you would have one side here of the angle at the 0 degree and the other side would specify that point

62
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:36,899
and if you put the protractor over here, the exact same thing would happen.

63
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:42,395
One side would be on this parallel line and the other side would point at the exact same point.

64
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:46,150
So given that, we not that not only this side is equivalent to this side

65
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:55,265
it is also equivalent to this side over here, and that tells us that's also equivalent to that side over there.

66
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:59,418
So all of these things in green are equivalent and by the same exact argument,

67
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,384
this side over here or this angle

68
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:10,752
is going to have the same measure as this angle and that's going to be the same as this angle, because they're opposite, or they're vertical angles.

69
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:20,857
Now the important thing to realize is the vertical angles are equal and the corresponding angles at the same point of intersection are also equal.

70
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:26,779
So that's a new word I'm introducing right over here. This angle and this angle are corresponding.

71
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:35,691
They represent kind of the top right corner in this example where we intersected. Here they represent the top right corner of the intersection.

72
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:40,835
This would be the top left corner. They're always gonna be equal, corresponding angles.

73
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:45,708
And once again, really it is a bit obvious.

74
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:53,986
Now on top of that, there are other words that people would see, essentially just proven that not only is this angle equivalent to this angle,

75
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:59,891
but it's also equivalent to this angle right over here. And these two angles, maybe if I call this

76
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:04,425
Let me label them so that we can make some headway here. So I'm gonna use lower case letters

77
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:10,716
for the angles themselves. Let's call this lowercase a, lowercase b, lowercase c..so lowercase c for the angle,

78
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:16,987
lowercase d and then let me call this e, f, g, h.

79
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:19,710
So we know from vertical angles that b is equal to c,

80
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,489
but we also know that b is equal to f, because they're corresponding angles.

81
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:31,293
And then f is equal to g. So vertical angles are equivalent. Corresponding angles are equivalent

82
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:34,051
and so we also know that obviously that b is equal to g.

83
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:36,806
And so we say that alternate interior angles are equivalent.

84
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:39,436
So you see that there are kind of on the interior of the intersection.

85
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:43,068
They're between the two lines but they're all on the opposite sides of the transversal.

86
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:48,999
Now you don't have to know that fancy word - alternate interior angles - you really just have to deduce

87
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:54,682
what we just saw over here, that vertical angles are gonna be equal and corresponding angles are gonna be equal.

88
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:58,682
And you see it with the other ones too. We know that a is gonna be equal to d, which is going to be equal to h, which is going to be equal to e.
