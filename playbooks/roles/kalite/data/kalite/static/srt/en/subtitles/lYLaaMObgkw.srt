1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
Use deductive reasoning and the
distributive property to

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,360
justify x plus y squared is
equal to x squared plus 2xy

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,690
plus y squared.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,190
Provide the reasoning
for each step.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,290
Now when they say use deductive
reasoning and all

7
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,920
this stuff, it might seem like
something daunting and new,

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,940
but this is no different than
what we've done in the past.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,970
In fact, we've done this
very exact problem.

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,700
So let's just do it step by
step, show our logic, and

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,020
that's essentially deductive
reasoning.

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,800
We're starting with a statement
and we're going to

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,330
deduce that this is going to
be equal to something else.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,379
So let's start with
x plus y squared.

15
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:39,090
   

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,550
We know an exponent means to
multiply something by itself

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,590
that many times.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,060
So we know that this is the same
thing, or we can deduce

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,130
that it is the same thing, as
x plus y times-- and I'll do

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,650
this next x plus y in
a different color--

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:57,100
times x plus y.

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,390
That's what x plus
y squared is.

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,630
Now they say to use the
distributive property.

24
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,970
And this is a bit
of review here.

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,950
And we've seen it many, many,
many times before.

26
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,580
The distributive property just
tells us that if we have a

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:16,100
times b plus c-- I want to do
as many colors as possible--

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:26,270
that this is equal to a times
each of these terms. a times b

29
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,340
plus a times c.

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,912
   

31
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:33,320
It's called distributive
property cause you're

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,710
distributing the a in all of
the terms in the expression

33
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,180
that your multiplying a by.

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,710
Now we can do the exact
same thing here.

35
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,030
Instead of an a, you could
imagine this is an x plus y.

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,880
And we can take this entire x
plus y and we can distribute

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,470
it on to both of the terms on
this expression that it is

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,000
multiplying.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,450
If this was an a, it'd
be ax plus ay.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,570
Now that it's an x plus y, we
multiply the x plus y times

41
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,640
each of those terms. And
that's just by the

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,550
distributive property.

43
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,620
So by the distributive property
that's going to be

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,264
equal to-- we'll distribute this
on to each of them-- x

45
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,514
plus y times x.

46
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:12,975
   

47
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:15,085
And actually I don't even have
to write the x after it.

48
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:15,940
I could just write it there.

49
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,200
It doesn't matter whether you
multiply x times x plus y, or

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,520
x plus y times x.

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,350
Order doesn't matter.

52
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,860
So that's that times that.

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,960
And then it's going to be
plus y times x plus y.

54
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,530
   

55
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,860
And now we can apply the
distributive property again.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,565
We have x being multiplied by
x plus y, then we have a y

57
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:39,570
being multiplied by x plus y.

58
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,510
So let's just do that again.

59
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:51,245
So then we get this is equal to
x times x plus x times y.

60
00:02:51,245 --> 00:02:54,410
   

61
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,270
I'm going through great pains to
keep the colors consistent.

62
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,280
Plus y times x.

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,970
Plus y times this x over here.

64
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,930
Plus y times that
y over there.

65
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,450
I'm doing this a lot
slower, and I'm not

66
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,600
skipping any steps here.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,770
Now what do each of these
things equal? x times x.

68
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,510
That is the same thing
as x squared.

69
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,850
So this is equal to x squared.

70
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,450
This right here, xy,
we have one xy.

71
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,220
But then we have yx is also
the same thing as xy.

72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,270
It doesn't matter what order
you multiply it in.

73
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,920
So xy plus xy is 2xy.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,580
Plus 2xy.

75
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,750
And then this last term right
here, y times y, that's the

76
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,310
same thing as y squared.

77
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,330
So we're done.

78
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,130
We've used deductive
reasoning.

79
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,110
We've just used logical steps to
start with a statement, to

80
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,930
start with an expression
really.

81
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,040
And we essentially just
logically manipulated it.

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
We started with.

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,210
I guess you could call this a
statement-- I guess that's the

84
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,790
best thing to call it-- and we
logically manipulated to come

85
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,250
up with another statement,
another fact.

86
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,290
We know that this is equal to
this using logical properties

87
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,090
and distributive property
and things like that and

88
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,340
properties of exponents.

89
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,333
