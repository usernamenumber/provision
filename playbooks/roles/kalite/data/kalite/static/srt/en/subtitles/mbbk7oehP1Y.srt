1
00:00:03,377 --> 00:00:05,126
Let's imagine that this is you,

2
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:08,336
and you are headed home for the holidays.

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:11,162
So you board a plane.

4
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:13,593
And you notice, while you're on this plane,

5
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:15,669
that the people around you are pretty sick.

6
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:18,008
The guy next to looks like he has a fever â

7
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:20,663
maybe the flight attendant is coughing.

8
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:22,118
So you head on home.

9
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:23,397
Although you're excited to see

10
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,909
everybody in your family,

11
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:27,450
you are feeling completely run down.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,459
So, you decide to head to bed,

13
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:32,081
hoping you'll feel better tomorrow.

14
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,524
Unfortunately, you don't feel better the next day.

15
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:37,288
You have a very high fever.

16
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:38,577
You don't even have the strength

17
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:41,029
to get out of bed for a few days.

18
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:42,677
And when you finally start to feel better,

19
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,487
you notice that you're not the only person

20
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:45,475
in your house who is sick.

21
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:46,876
Your dad is sick.

22
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:47,964
Your mom is sick, as well â

23
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,937
maybe some of your siblings.

24
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,335
You call your best friend.

25
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:54,080
They are sick, and their entire family is sick.

26
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,314
Maybe you talk to a neighbor,

27
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,740
and someone on your street, you learn,

28
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,508
has died from this illness.

29
00:00:58,508 --> 00:00:59,981
And news reports say that this is not

30
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:01,518
unique to your town â but it's happening

31
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:04,670
all over the state, and all over the country.

32
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,635
Now, this is a really scary situation.

33
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,541
But, unfortunately, it's not one that is

34
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,455
out of the realm of possibility.

35
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:12,750
In 1918 and 1919,

36
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,184
this was a particularly bad influenza season.

37
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:19,875
In fact, it was so bad that it led to approximately

38
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:23,355
50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.

39
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:25,232
And this is a pretty famous picture

40
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,820
from that era of a makeshift hospital.

41
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,007
There were so many sick people

42
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,777
during this flu season, that hospitals

43
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:32,578
couldn't provide enough beds and resources

44
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,775
for the patients who needed them.

45
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,839
Even during a so-called regular flu season,

46
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:43,066
every year, the influenza virus causes a lot of damage.

47
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:46,392
Flu is a top-10 killer in the United States.

48
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:49,203
And it leads to approximately

49
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:52,554
200,000 hospitalizations every year,

50
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:56,841
due to complications of influenza infections.

51
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,975
In addition to the 200,000 hospitalizations

52
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:03,093
that we have every year in this country,

53
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:06,723
approximately 20 to 40 thousand people

54
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:09,110
die every single year.

55
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,521
20,000 to 40,000 deaths on an annual basis.

56
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,417
So you can see that influenza

57
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:17,518
is not something to be taken lightly â

58
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:20,754
that it can lead to very serious consequences.

59
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,883
But luckily, there is something that can be done.

60
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,231
In fact, there's something that you can do about this.

61
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:27,210
As someone who's taking this training,

62
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,476
you're learning how to vaccinate

63
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,164
people in your community.

64
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,740
The modern influenza vaccine

65
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,263
is approximately 70% effective

66
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:37,107
in preventing influenza infection.

67
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:40,630
And so this is a great way to help prevent illness and death.
