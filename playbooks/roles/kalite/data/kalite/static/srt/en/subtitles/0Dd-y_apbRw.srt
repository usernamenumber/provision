1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,620
It always helps me to see a lot of examples of something so I

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,910
figured it wouldn't hurt to do more scientific

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,980
notation examples.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,910
So I'm just going to write a bunch of numbers and then write

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,390
them in scientific notation.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,170
And hopefully this'll cover almost every case you'll ever

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,150
see and then at the end of this video, we'll actually do some

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,420
computation with them to just make sure that we can

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,950
do computation with scientific notation.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,830
Let me just write down a bunch of numbers.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,370
0.00852.

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,630
That's my first number.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:39,440
My second number is seven trillion, twelve billion.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,030
I'm just arbitrarily stopping the zeroes.

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:50,600
The next number is 0.0000000 I'll just draw a couple more.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,630
If I keep saying zero, you might find that annoying.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,250
five hundred The next number -- right here, there's a

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,570
decimal right there.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:09,080
The next number I'm going to do is the number seven hundred and twenty-three.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,960
The next number I'll do -- I'm having a lot of seven's here.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,250
Let's do 0.6.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,290
And then let's just do one more just for, just to make sure

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,580
we've covered all of our bases.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,630
Let's say we do eight hundred and twenty-three and then let's throw some -- an

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,640
arbitrary number of zero's there.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,450
So this first one, right here, what we do if we want to write

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,900
in scientific notation, we want to figure out the largest

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,080
exponent of ten that fits into it.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,300
So we go to its first non-zero term, which

30
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,230
is that right there.

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,240
We count how many positions to the right of the decimal point

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,550
So it's going to be equal to this.

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,230
So it's going to be equal to eight -- that's that guy

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,370
right there -- 0.52.

35
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,210
So everything after that first term is going to

36
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,170
be behind the decimal.

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,330
So 0.52 times 10 to the number of terms we have.

38
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,510
One, two, three.

39
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,380
ten to the minus three.

40
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,430
Another way to think of it: this is a little bit more.

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,270
This is like eight one / two thousands, right?

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,420
Each of these is thousands.

43
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,280
We have eight one / two of them.

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,510
Let's do this one.

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,890
Let's see how many zero's we have.

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,610
We have three, six, nine, twelve.

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,620
So we want to do -- again, we start with our largest

48
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,710
term that we have.

49
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
Our largest non-zero term.

50
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,740
In this case, it's going to be the term all

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,430
the way to the left.

52
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,890
That's our seven.

53
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,560
So it's going to be 7.012.

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,950
It's going to be equal to 7.012 times 10 to the what?

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,340
Well it's going to be times ten to the one with this many zero's.

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,290
So how many things?

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,300
We had a one here.

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,690
Then we had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve zero's.

59
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,480
I want to be very clear.

60
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,590
You're not just counting the zero's.

61
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,850
You're counting everything after this first

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,720
term right there.

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,540
So it would be equivalent to a one followed by twelve zero's.

64
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,360
So it's times ten to the twelfth.

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,010
Just like that.

66
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,780
Not too difficult.

67
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,620
Let's do this one right here.

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,640
So we go behind our decimal point.

69
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,520
We find the first non-zero number.

70
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,970
That's our five.

71
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,600
It's going to be equal to five.

72
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,790
There's nothing to the right of it, so it's 5.00 if we wanted

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
to add some precision to it.

74
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,870
But it's five times and then how many numbers to the right, or

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,770
behind to the right of the decimal will do we have?

76
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:40,740
We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, and we

77
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,810
have to include this one, fourteen.

78
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,680
five times ten to the minus fourteenth power.

79
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,620
Now this number, it might be a little overkill to write this

80
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,660
in scientific notation, but it never hurts to get

81
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,690
the practice.

82
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,480
So what's the largest ten that goes into this?

83
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,630
Well, one hundred will go into this.

84
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,140
And you could figure out one hundred or ten squared by saying, "OK, this

85
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,990
is our largest term." And then we have two zero's behind it

86
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,200
because we can say one hundred will go into seven hundred and twenty-three.

87
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:17,060
So this is going to be equal to 7.23 times, we could say times

88
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,980
one hundred, but we want to stay in scientific notation, so I'll

89
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,230
write times ten squared.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,360
Now we have this character right here.

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,950
What's our first non-zero term?

92
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,300
It's that one right there, so it's going to be six times and

93
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,300
then how many terms do we have to the right of the decimal?

94
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,350
We have only one.

95
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,290
So times ten to the minus one.

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,520
That makes a lot of sense because that's essentially

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,160
equal to six divided by ten because ten to the minus

98
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,500
1 is 1/10 which is 0.6.

99
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,110
One more.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,760
Let me throw some commas here just to make this a

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,510
little easier to look at.

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,600
So let's take our largest value right there.

103
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,790
We have our eight.

104
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,220
This is going to be 8.23 -- we don't have to add the other

105
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,240
stuff because everything else is a zero -- times ten to the --

106
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,060
we just count how many terms are after the eight.

107
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,940
So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

108
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,160
8.23 times 10 to the 10.

109
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,290
I think you get the idea now.

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,580
It's pretty straightforward.

111
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,850
And more than just being able to calculate this, which is a

112
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,190
good skill by itself, I want you to understand why

113
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,930
this is the case.

114
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,800
Hopefully that last video explained it.

115
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,370
And if it doesn't, just multiply this out.

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,420
Literally multiply 8.23 times 10 to the 10 and

117
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,760
you will get this number.

118
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,180
Maybe you could try it with something smaller

119
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,030
than ten to the ten.

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,100
Maybe ten to the fifth.

121
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,130
And well, you'll get a different number but

122
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,970
you'll end up with five digits after the eight.

123
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,170
But anyway, let me do a couple more computation examples.

124
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:54,790
Let's say we had the numbers -- let me just make something

125
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,410
really small -- 0.0000064.

126
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,050
Let me make a large number.

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,100
Let's say I have that number and I want to multiply it.

128
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,440
I want to multiply it by -- let's say I have a really large

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,600
number -- three two -- I'm just going to throw a bunch of zero's here.

130
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,520
I don't know when I'm going to stop.

131
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,890
Let's say I stop there.

132
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,550
So this one, you can multiply out.

133
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,640
But it's a little difficult.

134
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,670
But let's put it into scientific notation.

135
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,080
One, it'll be easier to represent these numbers and

136
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,790
then hopefully you'll see that the multiplication actually

137
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
gets simplified as well.

138
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,540
So this top guy right here, how can we write him in

139
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,110
scientific notation?

140
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,550
It would be 6.4 times 10 to the what?

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,430
one, two, three, four, five, six.

142
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,430
I have to include the six.

143
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,470
So times ten to the minus six.

144
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,790
And what can this one be written as?

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,920
This one is going to be 3.2.

146
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,140
And then you count how many digits are after the three.

147
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,320
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

148
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,740
So 3.2 times 10 to the 11th.

149
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,180
So if we multiply these two things, this is equivalent to six

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,640
-- let me do it in a different color -- 6.4 times 10 to

151
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:21,570
the minus 6 times 3.2 times 10 to the 11th.

152
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,150
Which we saw in the last video is equivalent to 6.4 times 3.2.

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,350
I'm just changing the order of our multiplication.

154
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,550
Times ten to the minus six times ten to the eleventh power.

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,300
And now what will this be equal to?

156
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,480
Well, to do this, I don't want to use a calculator.

157
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,520
So let's just calculate it.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,820
So 6.4 times 3.2.

159
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,440
Let's ignore the decimals for a second.

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,620
We'll worry about that at the end.

161
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,050
So two times four is eight, two times six is twelve.

162
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,760
Nowhere to carry the one, so it's just one hundred and twenty-eight.

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
Put a zero down there.

164
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,290
three times four is twelve, carry the one.

165
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,360
three times six is eighteen.

166
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,310
You've got a one there, so it's one hundred and ninety-two.

167
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:08,680
Right?

168
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,500
Yeah.

169
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,660
one hundred and ninety-two.

170
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,920
You had them up and you get eight, four, one plus nine is ten.

171
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,580
Carry the one.

172
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,760
You get two.

173
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,910
Now, we just have to count the numbers behind

174
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
the decimal point.

175
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,260
We have one number there, we have another number there.

176
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,030
We have two numbers behind the decimal point,

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,110
so you count one, two.

178
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:34,870
So 6.4 times 3.2 is equal to 20.48 times 10 to the -- we

179
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,910
have the same base here, so we can just add the exponents.

180
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,440
So what's minus six plus eleven?

181
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,820
So that's ten to the fifth power, right?

182
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,170
Right.

183
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,570
Minus six and eleven.

184
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,030
ten to the fifth power.

185
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,680
And so the next question, you might say, "I'm done.

186
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,940
I've done the computation." And you have.

187
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,020
And this is a valid answer.

188
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,260
But the next question is is this in scientific notation?

189
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,160
And if you wanted to be a real stickler about it, it's not in

190
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,520
scientific notation because we have something here that could

191
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,130
maybe be simplified a little bit.

192
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,090
We could write this -- let me do it this way.

193
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,960
Let me divide this by ten.

194
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,950
So any number we can multiply and divide by ten.

195
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,120
So we could rewrite it this way.

196
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,600
We could write one / ten on this side and then we can multiply

197
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,260
times ten on that side, right?

198
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,890
That shouldn't change the number.

199
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,640
You divide by ten and multiply it by ten.

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
That's just like multiplying by one or dividing by one.

201
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,000
So if you divide this side by 10, you get 2.048.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,260
You multiply that side by ten and you get times ten to

203
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,720
the -- times ten is just times ten to the first.

204
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,770
You can just add the exponents.

205
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,190
Times ten to the sixth.

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,270
And now, if you're a stickler about it, this is good

207
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,830
scientific notation right there.

208
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,610
Now, I've done a lot of multiplication.

209
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,500
Let's do some division.

210
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's divide this guy by that guy.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,970
So if we have 3.2 times 10 to the eleventh power divided by

212
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,600
6.4 times 10 to the minus six, what is this equal to?

213
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,940
Well, this is equal to 3.2 over 6.4.

214
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,290
We can just separate them out because it's associative.

215
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,200
So, it's this times ten to the eleventh over ten to

216
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,280
the minus six, right?

217
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,520
If you multiply these two things, you'll

218
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,910
get that right there.

219
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,120
So 3.2 over 6.4.

220
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,010
This is just equal to 0.5, right?

221
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,150
32 is half of 64 or 3.2 is half of 6.4, so this

222
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,130
is 0.5 right there.

223
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,340
And what is this?

224
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,100
This is ten to the eleventh over ten to the minus six.

225
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,700
So when you have something in the denominator, you

226
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,610
could write it this way.

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,500
This is equivalent to ten to the eleventh over ten to the minus six.

228
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,060
It's equal to ten to the eleventh times ten to the

229
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,790
minus six to the minus one.

230
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,040
Or this is equal to ten to the eleventh times ten to the sixth.

231
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,600
And what did I do just there?

232
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,130
This is one over ten to the minus six.

233
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,570
So one over something is just that something to the

234
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,490
negative one power.

235
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,270
And then I multiplied the exponents.

236
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,100
You can think of it that way and so this would be equal

237
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,360
the same bases, ten in this case, and you're dividing them,

238
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,390
you just take the one the numerator and you subtract the

239
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,210
exponent in the denominator.

240
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,000
So it's eleven minus minus six, which is eleven plus six,

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,890
which is equal to seventeen.

242
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,200
So this division problem ended up being equal to

243
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,280
0.5 times 10 to the 17th.

244
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,140
Which is the correct answer, but if you wanted to be a

245
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,390
stickler and put it into scientific notation, we want

246
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,180
something maybe greater than one right here.

247
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,790
So the way we can do that, let's multiply

248
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,410
it by ten on this side.

249
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,980
And divide by ten on this side or multiply by one / ten.

250
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,870
Remember, we're not changing the number if you multiply

251
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,640
by ten and divide by ten.

252
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,940
We're just doing it to different parts of the product.

253
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:15,620
So this side is going to become five -- I'll do it in pink -- ten

254
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,910
times 0.5 is 5, times 10 to the 17th divided by 10.

255
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,180
That's the same thing as ten to the seventeenth times ten

256
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,640
to the minus one, right?

257
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,110
That's ten to the minus one.

258
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,320
So it's equal to ten to the sixteenth power.

259
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Which is the answer when you divide these two

260
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,480
guys right there.

261
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,740
So hopefully these examples have filled in all of the

262
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,250
gaps or the uncertain scenarios dealing with

263
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,250
scientific notation.

264
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,210
