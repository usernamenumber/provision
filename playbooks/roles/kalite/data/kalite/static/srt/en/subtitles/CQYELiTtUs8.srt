00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:06,107
In this video, I want to talk a little bit about Newton's first law of motion,

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:11,133
And this is a translation from Newton's principia from Latin to English.

3
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:16,200
So, the first law: Every body persists in its state of being at rest.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,800
So, state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight foward except

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,267
insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.

6
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:33,133
So, another way to rephrase what they're saying is that if there's something every body persists

7
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:38,933
so everything will stay at rest or moving at a constant velocity

8
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:43,871
unless it is compelled to change its state by force, unless it is acted on by a force

9
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:46,933
especially an unbalanced force, and I'll explain that in a second.

10
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,867
So, if I have something that's at rest, completely at rest

11
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:58,400
So, I have a...a, this is something we have seen before. Let's say that I have a rock.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:07,975
I have a rock on some place and it's laying on a field of grass

13
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:13,800
I can keep observing that rock and it is unlikely to move, assuming that nothing happens to it.

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,667
If there is no force applied to that rock, that rock will just stay there.

15
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:23,800
So the first part is pretty obvious: so every body persists in it's state of being at rest.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,667
So I'm not going to do the second part, except insofar there's some force applied to it.

17
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:33,400
So, clearly a rock will be at rest unless there is some force applied to it.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,267
Unless someone here is trying to push it, or roll it, or do something to it.

19
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:41,800
What's less intuitive about the first law, is the second part.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Every body persists in, either being in the state at rest, or moving uniformly straight foward.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,667
Except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.

22
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:57,200
So this Newton's first law, and I think I should do a little side here

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,467
Because this right here is Newton.

24
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:05,133
And if this is Newton's first law then why do I have this huge picture of this guy over here?

25
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:10,933
Well the reason is that Newton's first law is really just a restatement of this guy's law of inertia

26
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:19,241
And this guy - another titan of civilization really - this is Galileo Galilei

27
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:23,333
And he is the first person to formulate the law of inertia

28
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:27,175
And Newton just rephrased it a little bit and packaged it with his other laws

29
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,098
But he did many, many, many other things

30
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,667
So you really have to give Galileo credit for Newton's first law

31
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,933
So that is why I made him bigger in here

32
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,733
But I was in the midst of a thought!

33
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:41,467
So we understand that if something is at rest, it is going to stay at rest unless there is some force that acts on it.

34
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:44,267
In some definitions you will see "unless there is some unbalanced force"

35
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:49,400
And the reason why they say "unbalanced" is because you could have two forces that act on something

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,333
and they might balance out

37
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:55,333
For example: I could push on this side of the rock with a certain amount of force

38
00:02:55,333 --> 00:03:00,667
And if you push on this side of the rock with the exact same amount of force the rock won't move

39
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:05,867
The only way that it would move is if there is a lot more force on one side than there is on the other side

40
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,867
So if you have an unbalanced force

41
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:11,000
So if you have a ton of - and maybe the rock is a bad analogy

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,133
Let's take ice because ice is easier to move

43
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,533
Or ice on ice

44
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:19,533
So there is ice right here and then I have another block of ice sitting on top of that ice

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:25,533
So once again we are familiar with the idea: if there is no force acting on it, that ice won't move

46
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:31,733
But what happens if I'm pushing on the ice with a certain amount of force on that side

47
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:35,000
And you are pushing on the ice on that side with the same amount of force?

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
The ice will still not move

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,000
So this right here will be a balanced force

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,933
A balanced force

51
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:51,267
So the only way for the ice to change its condition, to change its restful condition, is if the force is unbalanced

52
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:57,800
So if we add a little bit of force on this side so that it more than compensates the force pushing it this way

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,267
Then you are going to see the ice block start to move, start to really accelerate in that direction

54
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:09,400
But I think this part is obvious: something that's at rest will stay at rest unless it is being acted

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,467
on by an unbalanced force

56
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:17,133
What is less obvious is the idea that something moving uniformly straight forward

57
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:21,010
Which is another way of saying something having a constant velocity

58
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,605
Constant velocity

59
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:29,933
What he is saying is that something that has a constant velocity will continue to have that constant velocity indefinitely

60
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,200
Unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force

61
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,600
And that is less intuitive, because everything in our human experience

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,267
Even if I were to push this block of ice, eventually it would stop

63
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:47,200
It won't just keep going forever, even assuming that this ice field is infinitely long

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:56,667
That ice will eventually stop. Or if I throw a tennis ball, that tennis ball will eventually stop

65
00:04:56,667 --> 00:05:05,000
It will eventually grind to a halt. Or if I roll a bowling ball, or if I - anything!

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,867
We've never seen, at least in our human experience, it looks like everything will eventually stop

67
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:14,333
So this is a very unintuitive thing to say: that something in motion will just keep going in motion indefinitely

68
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:19,533
Everything in human intuition says if you want something to keep going in motion

69
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:24,133
You have to keep putting more force, keep putting more energy into it for it to keep going

70
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:30,733
Your car won't go forever unless the engine keeps burning fuel to drive and consuming energy

71
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,533
So what are they talking about?

72
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:36,933
Well, in all of these examples - and I think this is actually a pretty brilliant insight from all of

73
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:41,467
these fellows - is that all of these things would have gone on forever

74
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,933
The ball would keep going on forever, this ice block would be going on forever

75
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:50,200
Except for the fact that there are unbalanced forces acting on them to stop them

76
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,467
So in the case of ice, even though ice on ice doesn't have a lot of friction

77
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:57,267
There is some friction between these two

78
00:05:57,267 --> 00:06:00,533
And so you have, in this situation, the force of friction is going to be

79
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:03,800
Acting against the direction of the movement of the ice

80
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,400
And friction really comes from an atomic level

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,867
So if you have the actual water motecules in a lattice structure in the ice cube

82
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:20,800
And then here are the water molecules in the lattice structure on the actual sea of ice that it is travelling on

83
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,333
They do kind of bump and grind into each other

84
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,267
Although they are both smooth, there are imperfections here

85
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,400
They bump and grind, they generate a little bit of heat

86
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,867
And they will essentially be working against the movement

87
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:36,533
So there is a force of friction that is being applied to here, and that is why it is stopping

88
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,600
And not only the force of friction, you also have some air resistance

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,667
The ice block is going to be bumping into all sorts of air particles

90
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:47,333
It might not be noticeable at first, but it is definitely going to keep it from going on forever

91
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,800
Same thing with the ball being tossed in the air

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Obviously at some point it hits the ground because of gravity, so that is one force acting on it

93
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,333
But even once it hits the ground, it doesn't keep rolling forever once again because of the friction

94
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,667
You know, specially if there is grass here, the grass is going to stop it from going

95
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,733
And even while it is in the air it is going to slow down, it is not going to have a constant velocity

96
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:14,364
Because you have all of these air particles that are going to bump into it

97
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:18,067
And exert force to slow it down

98
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,667
So what was really brilliant about these guys is that they could imagine a reality

99
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:28,333
Where you didn't have gravity, where you did not have air slowing things down

100
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:34,000
And they could imagine that in that reality something would just keep persisting in its motion

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,800
And the reason why Galileo frankly was probably good at thinking about that

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,067
Is that he studied the orbits of planets

103
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:46,400
And he probably theorized that, hey, maybe there is no air out there

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,333
And that maybe that's why these planets can just keep going around and around in orbit

105
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:55,667
And I should say their speed, because their direction is changing,

106
00:07:55,667 --> 00:08:01,800
Their speed never slows down, because there is nothing in space to actually slow down those planets

107
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,867
So anyway, hopefully you found that as fascinating as I do

108
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:08,600
Because on some level it is super, duper obvious, but on a whole other level it is completely not obvious

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,000
Specially this "moving uniformly straight forward"

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,733
And just to make the point clear, if gravity disappeared and you had no air

111
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:22,267
And you were to throw a ball, that ball would literally keep going in that direction forever

112
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:26,667
Unless some other unbalanced force acted to stop it

113
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:32,267
Another way to think about it, and this is an example you might see in everyday life

114
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:41,533
Is if I'm in an airplane, that is going at a completely constant velocity

115
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,467
And there is absolutely no turbulence in the airplane

116
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:50,790
So if I'm sitting in the airplane right over here and it is going at a constant velocity

117
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,667
Completely smooth, no turbulence

118
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:57,800
There is really no way for me to tell whether the airplane is moving without looking out the window

119
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,067
Let's assume that there are no windows in that airplane, it is going at a constant velocity

120
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:06,800
And there is no turbulence, and let's say that I can't hear anything

121
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,533
So I can't even hear the engines

122
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:11,400
There is no way for me to sense that the plane is moving

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,933
Because from my frame of reference, it looks completely identical

124
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:19,333
To if I was in that same plane that was resting on the ground

125
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,733
And that is another way to think about it that is actually very intuitive that they are similar states

126
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:28,267
Moving at a constant velocity or being at rest

127
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,000
You really can't tell whether you are in one or in the other
