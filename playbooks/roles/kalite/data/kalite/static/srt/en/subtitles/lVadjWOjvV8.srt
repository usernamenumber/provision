1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
In the last video we talked about how parallax is the apparent change

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,950
in position of something based on your line of sight.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,797
And if you experience parallax kind of in your everyday life

4
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:13,895
if you look outside of your car window while its moving you see that

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,133
nearby objects seem to be moving faster than far away objects.

6
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:23,733
So in the last video we measured the apparent displacement of the star at different

7
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,401
points in the year relative to straight up.

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,600
But you can also meausre it relative to things in the night sky

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,800
at that same time of year that same time of day that don't

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,267
appear to be moving. And they won't appear to be moving because they are

11
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:39,733
way way way farther away than this star over here there may be

12
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,445
other galaxies or maybe even clusters of galaxies or who knows.

13
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,045
Things that are not changing in position, so that's another option.

14
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,797
And that's another way of making sure you are looking at

15
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,200
the right part of the universe.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
So you could measure relative to straight up if you know

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,380
based on the time of year or time of day that you are looking

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,208
at the same direction of the universe.

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,024
Or you could just find things in the universe that are way

20
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:03,367
far back that their apparent position isn't changing.

21
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,590
So just to visualize this again

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,801
I'll visualize it in a slightly different way.

23
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,448
Let's, let's say this is the night field of vision.

24
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:19,389
Let me scroll to the right a little bit. Let's say our night field of vision looks like this.

25
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:23,011
I'll do it in a dark color because it's at night.

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:26,123
So your night feild of vision looks like that.

27
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:31,556
And let's say that this right over here is straight up.

28
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,578
This right over here is striaght up.This right here is if

29
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,512
we are looking straight up in the night sky.

30
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:39,776
And just to make the convention, in the last video

31
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,133
I changed our orientation a little bit.

32
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,188
I'll reorientate us in kind of a traditional orientation.

33
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:49,412
So, if we make this North, this is South, this will be West

34
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:52,292
and this will be East.

35
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,800
So if we look at the star in the summer

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,447
what will it look like?

37
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,600
Well, first of all the Sun is just begining to rise.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,137
So, if you can think about it, this North

39
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:04,459
this North direction, we are looking at the sun

40
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,013
from, we are looking at the Earth from above

41
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:09,614
so the North will be the top of this sphere over here.

42
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:13,200
And the South will be the bottom of the sphere, the

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,744
other side of the sphere that we're not seeing.

44
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:20,109
The east will be this side of the sphere, where

45
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:22,524
the Sun is just begining to rise.

46
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:26,286
right over there.

47
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:29,444
So what will be the apparent position of the star?

48
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,626
Well it's going to be towards the East, it's going

49
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,413
to be towards the direction that the Sun is rising.

50
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:38,685
So this angle right over here will be right

51
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:41,239
right over there.

52
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,867
So this will be the angle.

53
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:47,091
So this will be the angle theta.

54
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:50,109
So this is in the summer. And what about the winter?

55
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,128
Well in the winter, in order for straight up to be that

56
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:57,467
same point in time, or that same direction in the universe

57
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:02,467
I should say, then the Sun will just be setting.

58
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,435
So we're rotating that way, so we're just going to be

59
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,289
capturing the last glimpse of sunlight.

60
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,200
So in that situation, the sun is going to be setting.

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,955
So this is our winter sun, our winter sun, I'll do that

62
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,741
in a slightly different color.

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,110
The sun will be setting on the West.

64
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,896
And now, the apparent direction of that star is going to be in

65
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:25,450
the direction of the Sun again, but it's going to be

66
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,283
shifted away from center. So it is going to be

67
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:34,785
to the right of center, sorry, to the LEFT of center.

68
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:38,639
So it's going to be right over here, it is going to be

69
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,775
right over here. And it's a little bit unintuitive the way

70
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:45,800
I drew it. In the last video, well I won't make any judgement on the way

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,785
the last one is easier to visualize or this one is.

72
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,467
Over here, I just wanted to make the convention that North is

73
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:55,079
up and South is down. But I just want to be clear,

74
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,679
over here the Sun is, well the sun always sets to the West.

75
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:02,277
So in the Winter, the sun will be right over there, this will be shifted

76
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,435
from center in the direction of the Sun, so it will

77
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:09,467
be at an angle theta just like that.

78
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:12,122
in the winter.

79
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,119
Now, that's all review from the last video. I just

80
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,488
reorientated how we visualized it. What I want

81
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,667
to do in this video, given that we can measure theta, how can

82
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:23,800
we figure out how far this star actually is.

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,308
So, let's just think about it a little bit before I actually

84
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,723
give you a theta value.

85
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:33,949
If we know theta, then we know, we know, that his angle is

86
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,467
right over here because this is a right angle. We're

87
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:38,965
going to know that this angle right over here is 90 degrees

88
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,800
minus theta. We also know, we also know the distance from

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,324
the Sun to the Earth. And let's say we're just going to approximate

90
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,785
here, its 1 astronomical unit (AU) it changes a little bit

91
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:54,429
over the course of a year, but the mean distance is 1 AU.

92
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:59,800
So we know the angle, we know a side adjacent to the angle

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,299
and what we're trying to do is figure out a side opposite

94
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:07,757
the angle, this distance right here.

95
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,133
The distance from the sun to the star.

96
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,773
And this is of course a right trianle.

97
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:15,800
And you can see it right here, this is the hypotenus.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,533
So now, we just need to break out some relatively

99
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,178
basic trigonometry

100
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,686
so if we know this angle, what trig ratio deals with an adjacent

101
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:26,240
side and an opposite side?

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,609
So let me right now, my famous sohcahtoa, I didn't come up

103
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:30,791
with it so, the famous sohcahtoa.

104
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,113
Soh-cah-toa.

105
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,435
Sine is opposite over hypotenus. Those aren't

106
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,850
the two we care about.

107
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,079
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenus, we don't know

108
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,200
what the hypotenus is and we don't

109
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,259
care about it just yet. But the

110
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,133
tangent is the opposide over the adjacent.

111
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,133
Opposite over the adjacent. So if we take the tangent of

112
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:51,132
the angle, if we take the tangent of 90 minus theta,

113
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:55,126
if we take the tangent of 90 minus theta, this

114
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:58,098
is going to be equal to the distance to the star.

115
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,133
This distance right over here.

116
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,764
The distance to the star, or the distance to the Sun to the star.

117
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:06,782
We can later figure out the distance from the Earth to the star,

118
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,104
it's not going to be too different, because the

119
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:11,000
star is so far away.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,145
But the distance from the sun to the star dividied by

121
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:16,395
the adjacent side, divided by 1 astronomical unit.

122
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:18,625
And I'm asumming everything is in astronomical units.

123
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,086
So you can multiply both sides by 1, and you'll get the

124
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,200
units in astronomical units. The distance is equal to

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,327
the tangent of 90 minus theta. Not too bad.

126
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,696
So let's figure out what a distance would be

127
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:36,467
based on some actual meaurments.

128
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:39,012
Let's say you were to measure some star

129
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,427
measure this change in angle right here.

130
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:43,795
And let's say you got the total change in angle

131
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:45,867
right over here, from 6 months apart the

132
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:48,067
biggest spread, and you're making sure you're

133
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,297
looking at a point in the universe relative to straight up.

134
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,433
You can do it other ways, but this is just simplifing

135
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,600
our visualization and simplifies our math.

136
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,077
And you get to be 1.5374 arcseconds.

137
00:06:57,077 --> 00:07:03,200
And I want to be very clear,

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,340
this is a very very very very small angle.

139
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,800
Just to visualize it, or another way to think about it is

140
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,609
there are 60 arcseconds per arcminute,

141
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,767
and there are 60 arcminutes per degree.

142
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,996
Another way to think about it is a degree is like

143
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:21,133
an arc hour. So if you want to

144
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:27,727
convert this to degrees you have 1.5374 arcseconds

145
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:35,715
times 1 degree divided by 3600 arcseconds.

146
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:38,037
The dimentions cancle out. And you get this

147
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,823
equal to, let's get the calculator out, this is being

148
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:53,533
equal to, 1.5374/3600, so it's 4.206, I'll round, because we

149
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,867
only want 5 significant digits.

150
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,145
This is an infinite precision right here, because

151
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,374
that's an absolute quantity, it's a definition.

152
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:02,650
So let me write this down.

153
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:12,133
So this is going to be 4.2707 x 10^-4 degrees,

154
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,600
you can write it just like that.

155
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,022
Now, let me be clear, this is the total, this is the

156
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,133
total angle, this angle that we care about is going

157
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,737
to be half of this, so

158
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,533
we could divide this by 2,

159
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,467
let's just do just our significant digits,

160
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:38,200
4.2706 x10^-4 divided by 2, is going to be

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,307
2.1353 x10^-4. So that's this angle right over here.

162
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:48,133
This angle, or this shift from center we could vizualize it

163
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:55,127
is going to be 2.135 x 10^-4 degrees.

164
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,681
So now that we know that, we already figured out

165
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,467
how to find the distance, we could just

166
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:01,396
apply this right over here.

167
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:03,115
So let's just take, let's just take the tangent

168
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:06,200
which make sure your calculator is in 'degree' mode,

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,362
I made sure about that before I started this video,

170
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,638
tangent of 90 minus this angle right here (2.1359x10^-4)

171
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:15,793
so instead of retyping it, I'll just type the last answer

172
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:19,601
So 90 minus this angle, and we get this large

173
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:24,616
number, 268326. Now remember, what were our units?

174
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:28,133
This distance right here, this distance right here

175
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:34,973
is 268326, I should just round because I only have

176
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:38,363
5 significant digits here.

177
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:43,378
Although with the trig, trig number of significant digits

178
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:45,800
get a little bit shaddier. But I'll just write

179
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:55,867
the whole number here, 268326 astronomic units.

180
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:59,200
So it's this many, it's this many distances between

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,350
the Sun and the Earth.

182
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,000
Now, if w wanted to calculate that into lightyears,

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,691
we just have to know, and you can calculate this

184
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,800
multiple ways, you could just figure out how far

185
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,428
an AU is versus a lightyear. But, there are

186
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:24,385
so this is AUs, 1 lightyear is equivalent to 63,115AU,

187
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,614
give or take a little bit.

188
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,796
So this is going to be equal to, AU's cancle out,

189
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,954
this quantity divided by that quantitiy is lightyears.

190
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:35,623
Let's do that, so let's take this number that we just

191
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:43,518
got divided by 63,115 and we have it in lightyears.

192
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,769
So it's about 4.25 lightyears.

193
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:48,766
I'm messing with the significant digits here, but

194
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:59,447
just a round about answer, 4.25 lightyears.

195
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:00,867
Now remember, that's about how far the

196
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,800
closest star to the Earth is. And so the closest

197
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,806
star to the Earth has this very very very apparent

198
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:11,382
a very small change in angle. You can imagine

199
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,100
as you go farther and farther stars from this,

200
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,283
that angle, this angle right here is going to

201
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,744
get even smaller and smaller and all the way

202
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,787
until you get really far stars and it would be even with

203
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:22,434
our best instruments you wouldn't be able to measure that.

204
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,639
angle. Anyway, hopefully you found that cool

205
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,171
because you just figured out a way to

206
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,168
use trigonometry in a really good way to measure angles

207
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:34,137
in the night sky, with the night sky, to actually figure out

208
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:37,200
how far we are from the nearest stars.

209
00:11:37,200 --> 99:59:59,999
I think that's pretty neat.
