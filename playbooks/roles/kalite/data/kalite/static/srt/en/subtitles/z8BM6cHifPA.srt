1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,390
In the last a video we figured
out the volume between this

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,570
surface, which was xy squared
and the xy-plane when x went

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,540
from 0 to 2 and y
went from 0 to 1.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,390
And the way we did it
is we integrated with

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,890
respect to x first.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,680
We said, pick a y, and
let's just figure out the

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,860
area under the curve.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,640
And so we integrated with
respect to x first, and then we

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,850
integrated with respect to y.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,390
But we could have done it
the other way around.

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,080
So let's do that and just make
sure we got the right answer.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,716
So let me erase a lot of this.

14
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:37,636
So remember, our answer was 2/3
when we integrated with respect

15
00:00:37,636 --> 00:00:40,440
to x first, and then
with respect to y.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,560
But I will show you that we can
integrate the other way around.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,610
That's good when you can
get the same answer in

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,160
two different ways.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,400
So let me redraw that graph
because I want to give

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,570
you the intuition again.

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:03,626
So that's my x-axis,
y-axis, z-axis.

22
00:01:03,626 --> 00:01:10,850
x, y, z.

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,540
Then this is my xy-plane.

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,180
down here.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,990
   

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:25,370
y goes from 0 to 1; x goes from
0 to 2, This is x equals 1,

27
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,650
this is equals 2, this is y
equals 1, and then the graph--

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,290
I will do my best to draw it.

29
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,060
Looks something-- let me get
some contrast going here.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,310
So the graph looks
something like this.

31
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,380
Let me see if I can draw it.

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,260
On this side it looks something
like that and then it comes

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,070
down like that, straight.

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,910
And then, the volume
we care about.

35
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,925
It's actually this volume
underneath the graph.

36
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:01,680
   

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,690
This is the top of the
surface on that side.

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,150
We care about this volume
underneath the surface.

39
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,730
And then when we draw the
bottom of the surface-- let

40
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,050
me do it in a darker color--
looks something like this.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,060
This is the bottom
underneath the surface.

42
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
I can even shade it a little
bit just to show you that

43
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,750
it's the underneath.

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,010
   

45
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,970
Hopefully that's a
decent rendering of it.

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,670
Let's look back at
what we had before.

47
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,840
It's like a page that I just
flipped up at this point, and

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,560
we care about this volume,
kind of the colored

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
area under there.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,250
So let's figure
out how to do it.

51
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,900
Last time we integrated
with respect to x first.

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,330
Let's integrate with
respect to y first.

53
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,520
So let's hold x constant.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,600
So if we hold x constant what
we could do is for a given

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,560
x-- let's pick an x.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,820
   

57
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,170
So if we pick a given x,
let's pick the x here.

58
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,880
   

59
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,900
Then what we can do, for a
given x, you can view that

60
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,310
function of x and y.

61
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,070
If x is a constant, let's say
if x is 1 then z is just

62
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,490
equal to y squared.

63
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,710
That's easy to figure out the
area under because we can see

64
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,650
that x isn't the constant, but
we can treat it as a constant.

65
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,640
So for example, for any
given x, we would have

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,730
a curve like this.

67
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,560
   

68
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
What we could do is we could
try to figure out the

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,610
area of this curve first.

70
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,300
So how do we do that?

71
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,650
Well, we just said, we could
kind of view this function up

72
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,860
here as z is equal to xy
squared because that's

73
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,830
exactly what it is.

74
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,610
But we're holding x constant.

75
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,010
We're treating it
like a constant.

76
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,360
To figure out that area we
could take a dy, a change

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,665
in y, multiply it by the
height, which is xy squared.

78
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:54,130
   

79
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:02,830
So we take xy squared, multiply
it by dy, and then if we want

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,020
this entire area we integrate
it from y is equal to

81
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,910
0 to y is equal to 1.

82
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,080
   

83
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,600
Fair enough.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,570
Now once we have that area, if
you want the volume underneath

85
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,210
this entire surface what we
could do is we can multiply

86
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,450
this area times dx and
get some depth going.

87
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,780
Let me pick a nice
color, that's green.

88
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,120
So that's our dx.

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,640
So if we multiply that times
dx we would get some depth.

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,950
Let me do a darker color,
get some contrast.

91
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,080
Sometimes I feel like that
guy who paints on PBS.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,820
So now we have the volume of
this, you kind of view it-- the

93
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,950
area under the curve times a
dx, so we have some depth here.

94
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,750
So it's time dx.

95
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,540
And if we want to figure out
the entire volume under this

96
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,030
surface-- between the surface
and the xy-plane given this

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,370
constraint to our domain-- we
just integrate from x

98
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,930
is equal to 0 to 2.

99
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,120
   

100
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,050
All right, so let's
think about it.

101
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,870
This area in green here
that we started with, that

102
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,100
should be a function of x.

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,600
We held x constant, but
depending on which x you pick

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,780
this area is going to change.

105
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,820
So when we evaluate this
magenta inner integral with

106
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,330
respect to y we should
get a function of x.

107
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,470
And then when you evaluate
the whole thing we'll

108
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,220
get our volumes.

109
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,320
So let's do it.

110
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,700
Let's evaluate this
inner integral.

111
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,420
Hold x constant.

112
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,090
What's the antiderivative
of y squared?

113
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,020
It's y of the third over 3.

114
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,530
   

115
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,586
The x is a constant, right?

116
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:42,290
We're going to evaluate
that at 1 and at 0.

117
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,670
The outer integral is still
with respect to x dx.

118
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,730
This is equal to-- let's see.

119
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,860
When you evaluate y is equal
to 1 you get 1 to the third.

120
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,370
That's 1.

121
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,050
So it's x/3 minus when
y is 0 then that whole

122
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,560
thing just becomes 0.

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,870
This purple expression
is just x/3.

124
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,350
   

125
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,120
And then we still have
the outside integral

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,560
from 0 to 2 dx.

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,290
So given what x we have, the
area of this green surface--

128
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,410
that was where we started.

129
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,430
Given any given x, that
area-- I wanted something

130
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,700
with some contrast.

131
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,550
This area is x/3 depending
on which x you pick.

132
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,830
If x is 1, this area
right here is 1/3.

133
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,580
But now we're going to
integrate underneath the entire

134
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,550
surface and get our volume.

135
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,160
And like I said, when
you integrate it,

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,870
it's a function of x.

137
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,220
So let's do that.

138
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,440
And this is just plain old
vanilla, standard integral.

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,930
So what's the
antiderivative of x?

140
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,930
It's x squared over 2.

141
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,890
We have a 1/3 there so
it equals x squared

142
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,180
over 2 times 3.

143
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,410
So x squared over 6.

144
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,410
And we're going to evaluate
it at 2 and at 0.

145
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,030
2 squared over 6 is 4/6.

146
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,110
Minus 0/6, which is equal to 0.

147
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,640
Equals 4/6.

148
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
What is 4/6?

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,850
Well, that's just the
same thing as 2/3.

150
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,360
So the volume under the surface
is 2/3, and if you watched

151
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,150
the previous video you will
appreciate the fact that when

152
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,590
we integrated the other way
around, when we did it with

153
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,540
respect to x first and then y,
we got the exact same answer.

154
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,950
So the universe is in
proper working order.

155
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,580
And I've surprisingly,
actually finished this

156
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,090
video with extra time.

157
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,400
So for fun, we can just spin
this graph and just appreciate

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,290
the fact that we have figured
out the volume between this

159
