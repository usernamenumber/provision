1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:08,636
It's estimated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has 100 to 400 billion stars,

2
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:12,029
and when you hear a number like that the obvious question is:

3
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:15,944
Are there civilizations on planets that are orbiting any of these stars

4
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:20,241
and maybe even more interesting question is can we detect any of those civilizations?

5
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:24,379
Have they gotten to the level of technological progress like us,

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,662
that they are emitting electromagnetic waves into space

7
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:30,287
and other civilization like ours can detect and say,

8
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:36,954
"Hey, there is someone else out there watching television or using radio or whatever else they might be doing."

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,933
So, what I want to do with this video is not answer that question.

10
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,938
That's a big open question, we don't know the answer.

11
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:45,508
We don't have anywhere near enough information to definitively answer that question,

12
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:49,502
but I want to do is come up with a framework for at least thinking about that question,

13
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,236
a way of actually estimating

14
00:00:51,236 --> 00:00:56,929
how many detectable civilizations there are in just our galaxy,

15
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,918
and there is a formula, that you may or may not have heard of,

16
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:02,959
called the Drake Equation.

17
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,379
and what we are going to do is independently

18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,000
derive our own version of the Drake Equation.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,831
It's going to be slightly different,

20
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:11,554
but it is the same thought process

21
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,425
and in the future video, I'm going to maybe reconcile

22
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:17,425
what we come up with, with the Drake Equation,

23
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,338
and just so you know Drake equation is named for Frank Drake,

24
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:23,810
who is a Professor at University of California Santa Cruz.

25
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,021
He first, kind of put some structure around this problem,

26
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,790
that's why the formula or the equation has his name,

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,364
but the equation is not an equation you can apply

28
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:35,523
on a daily basis and get results that you can use to build things,

29
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:40,871
but what it's, it's the structures of our thinking around this question of

30
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:46,041
How many detectable civilizations are there in our galaxy?

31
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:50,067
And to answer this question, I am going to start little bit differently than Frank Drake did

32
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,498
He starts with the number of new stars that're born each year,

33
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:56,282
we will see that our definitions are actually pretty close to each other

34
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,856
what I want to do, is start with the total number of stars,

35
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:03,902
So, we are trying to come up with is,

36
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:07,825
I will call it 'N' and this is number of detectable civilizations,

37
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:20,256
number of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way, in our galaxy.

38
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:25,867
and once again, there could be civilizations, looking back in the star field right over here

39
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:30,179
this star right over here, maybe it has a planet that is in the right place

40
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:33,579
that has liquid water and maybe there is intelligent life on that planet,

41
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:37,000
but they might not be detectable,

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,375
because, they aren't technologically advanced enough that they are using electromagnetic radiation

43
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,215
or maybe they just figured out some other way to communicate

44
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:49,768
or maybe they are beyond using electromagnetic radiation, you know, radio waves and all the rest to communicate

45
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:53,415
so we will never be able to detect them.

46
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:57,215
We are talking about civilizations like ours that are, to some degree,

47
00:02:57,215 --> 00:03:00,605
using technology not too different than our own.

48
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,698
That's what we mean by 'detectable',

49
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:06,021
so let's think about that little bit.

50
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:11,200
I like to start with just the total number of stars in our solar system.

51
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,667
So let's just start with, I will call it, N*,

52
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:33,000
so this is the number of stars in our galaxy, and our best guess, I said is this's going to be 100-400 billion stars.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,815
We don't even know how many there are, some of them are undetectable,

54
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,271
and the center of our galaxy is just a big blur to us

55
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:40,646
we don't even know what's on the other side of that,

56
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:44,267
e can't even see all the stars that are packed into the center,

57
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:49,200
so this is our best guess, 100-400 billion stars.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,113
Now obviously, there is going to be subset of those stars that even have planets.

59
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:56,954
So, let's multiply the times that subset; so lets multiply

60
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:59,615
times the frequency of having a planet.

61
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:04,067
If you are a star, this is the percent chance or the frequency or

62
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:08,010
of the fraction of these stars that have planets (f sub p)

63
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:17,485
so, I'll write this way "fractions that have planets",

64
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:21,575
So, if this is a hundred billion, let's say I am making a guess here

65
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,138
and we are learning more about this everyday,

66
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:27,387
there are all these discoveries of 'exoplanets'- planets outside our solar systems,

67
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:29,098
maybe this is one fourth.

68
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:33,102
Then you could say, well that means there are 100 billion times one fourth,

69
00:04:33,102 --> 00:04:37,148
that means there are 25 billion stars that have planets around them.

70
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:40,036
But that's still not enough to go to civilizations.

71
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:43,646
We also need to think about planets, there could be a planet like Jupiter,

72
00:04:43,646 --> 00:04:49,205
and we don't know how life as we know it can survive on a planet like Jupiter or Neptune or Mercury.

73
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,267
It has to have planets that are good for sustaining life.

74
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:55,938
Preferably have a rocky core, liquid water on the outside,

75
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,538
that's what we think are the ingredients we need for life,

76
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,021
maybe we are just not being creative enough, that's what we know as life is being.

77
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:12,744
So, let's multiply this times the average number of life sustaining or planets that could sustain life on them.

78
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:15,129
So we don't necessarily know that they are going to have life,

79
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,344
but they seem like they are just the right distance from the star,

80
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:23,708
not too hot, not too cold. They have the right amount of gravity, water, all the other stuff,

81
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,762
and we still don't know what this means,

82
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:44,662
but this means average number, so given a number of solar systems with planets, what's the average number of planets capable of sustaining life,

83
00:05:44,662 --> 00:05:46,225
and once again, you don't know this answer.

84
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:53,308
maybe it is 0.1, it's probably less than 1.

85
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:56,025
Therefore any given solar system that has planets,

86
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:59,621
the average number capable of sustaining life maybe its 0.1 maybe it's more than 1, I don't know.

87
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:02,667
We don't know the exact answer here, but I will throw an answer in,

88
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,846
I 'll throw out a guess, maybe it is 0.1.

89
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:10,902
And here the fraction that has planets (f sub p), i don't know, i will throw that out as,

90
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:15,277
and once again I am making up these numbers, we really don't know the right answers, this is one-fourth.

91
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:18,185
But if we were to multiply this out we would have

92
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:25,185
the average number of planets in our solar system that are capable of sustaining life

93
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:30,067
that are around stars that have planets and these planets are capable of sustaining life.

94
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:43,533
Now, n sub p will give us the total number of planets in our galaxy capable of sustaining life.

95
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:48,533
Now, just because you have liquid water and right temperature and all the other rest of the ingredients

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,333
doesn't mean that you will actually have life happening on your planet.

97
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:58,733
So let's multiply that times the fraction that actually generate life (f sub l)

98
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:03,267
So f sub p is the fraction that actually have life

99
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:04,600
and this is actually a very , we dont know this answer, so this is the fraction

100
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,867
that have life on them

101
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:13,800
And this is a really big open question

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,067
maybe if you have the ingredients, maybe every planet has life

103
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:21,000
maybe it is a frequent thing that's happening in our galaxy and frankly our universe

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,267
or maybe it's a very infrequent thing

105
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:26,467
maybe it's just the right kind of freak set of circumstances that just have to happen

106
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:30,267
i will throw out a number, just for the sake of having a number

107
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,933
maybe it is one out of every ten planets

108
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:36,600
that have all the right ingredients for life actually do generate life.

109
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,867
My personal guess is probably higher than that given that

110
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:44,400
life seems life seems such a robust and flexible thing we have seen in all sort of weird circumstances.

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,333
Actually let me make it higher number than that so let me make it one half (0.5)

112
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:52,800
assuming that we have all of the ingredients.

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
So this should tell us essentially

114
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,384
how many planets in our galaxy have had life on them at some point

115
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:04,600
in those planets' lives.

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,200
The life might have come and gone

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
maybe destroyed itself through nuclear war.

118
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,800
But this would tell us the number of planets in our galaxy

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,933
that had life at at least one point in their history.

120
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,133
Now we care about civilizations, about intelligent life..

121
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:33,667
So maybe if the asteroid never hit earth...

122
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:38,000
the dinosaurs would have never evolved to the point of generating

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,867
radios and tvs and telephones and all the rest..

124
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,067
and so it is kind of a freak circumstance

125
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,800
that because they were destroyed these gaps in the ecosystem developed

126
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,792
so we could emerge and and be intelligent and

127
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,018
do all these crazy things

128
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,410
like make YouTube videos and all the rest.

129
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,623
So, let's multiply this times the fraction

130
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:56,792
if you get all of this, the fraction

131
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,908
that actually end up having intelligent life

132
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:05,942
and maybe this fraction is,

133
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:15,338
to a number of 1/10, then probably

134
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:17,008
in the next video I'll calculate it all.

135
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:19,227
Now this is very important to realise

136
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:22,374
because once again, you could have life

137
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:25,637
these are all examples of life right over here

138
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,797
This is actually life on Earth, on our planet

139
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,377
even though this looks quite alien

140
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:32,236
this is a weeble, kind of looked at from very close-up,

141
00:09:32,236 --> 00:09:35,226
but there is all sorts of forms of life

142
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,963
many of which we probably can't even begin to imagine

143
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:41,975
but what we care is that if intelligent life

144
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,158
starts to emerge on the planet

145
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:46,526
because only intelligent life has a chance,

146
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,943
we believe of being able to eventually communicate in ways

147
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:53,342
that are detectable by us.

148
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,152
Now I said intelligent life, but

149
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,577
maybe not all intelligent life will eventually

150
00:09:57,577 --> 00:10:00,704
get to the technological sophistication, where

151
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:05,719
they will be using radio waves, electro-magnetic radiation to communicate with each other

152
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,542
maybe we might have stagnated at this stage

153
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,253
if nothing of the right things didn't happen..

154
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:15,385
So what we need to do now, is multiply this

155
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:19,600
so right here, we would have the number of planets

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,376
in our galaxy that have had intelligent life on them at some point in their history

157
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,943
maybe not at a time that coincides with ours,

158
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:34,235
but what we wanna do is bring it down even more to the percentage that get to the point

159
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:38,527
that they can develop technology that allows us to detect them.

160
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:47,044
So, let me multiply times the fraction that are, I'll put a 'C' here,

161
00:10:47,044 --> 00:10:49,976
'C' for, maybe they're using communication; 'C' for communications

162
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:53,627
that allow us to detect them.

163
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:56,703
So this is detectable, the fraction that are detectable.

164
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:02,840
Now you might think that we're done, this will give you the Total Number of Civilizations, or life-forms

165
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:11,125
in our Galaxies or the planets that have life forms that developed detectable technologies at some point

166
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:19,206
in their history.. Now it would be nice if civilizations be not born and die

167
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:22,895
but the reality is, they do die. They might destroy themselves or whatever,

168
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:26,960
and they might exist for only a small period of time for the history of that planet

169
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,891
or the history of that Solar System.

170
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:35,659
So in order to make it the number of civilizations that are in existance now

171
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:39,902
and I'll clarify what "now" means in the next video because really if we are

172
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:43,192
detecting something from a star that's 10,000 lightyears away

173
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,892
our "now" means we are just receiving their signals

174
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:50,527
so, they released the signals 10,000 years ago.

175
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:54,453
But what I want to do is get to know what is the fraction of these whose signals

176
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:57,658
are reaching us right now.

177
00:11:57,658 --> 00:12:02,688
and here, I'll say what's the average lifespan of a civilization

178
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:06,342
I'll put that "L", who knows what is, maybe 10,000 years

179
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:15,022
so civilization lifespan as going to be that over the life of the star

180
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:22,145
So, I'll put a 'T' here, for the average lifespan for the star,

181
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:24,410
and I could say the average lifespan for the planet,

182
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,703
or whatever, but we're assuming once our star

183
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,888
supernovas, you're not going to have a chance for

184
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:33,258
life on Earth to develop anymore.

185
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,542
So, maybe this thing appears ten thousand years

186
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:39,219
and this down here is maybe 10 billion years.

187
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:42,043
and if you were to multilply this out, you should get

188
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:46,676
the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy right now.

189
00:12:46,676 --> 00:12:49,109
I'll leave you there, and next we'll discuss it a little bit

190
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:54,911
more, and reconcile it with the more famous version of Drake's equation,

191
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,145
and I'll also try and talk about this little piece of bit,

192
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,222
because I think it might be a little confusing, and

193
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll try to diagram that out a little bit more..
