1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:09,005
Let's say the 2011 nominal GDP is: 15,294.3 billion dollars.

2
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:11,088
And I didn't just make this number up.

3
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:16,202
This is actually the advanced estimate of what 2011 GDP was in the fourth quarter.

4
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:18,342
This is just a fourth quarter number.

5
00:00:18,342 --> 00:00:29,424
They took the fourth quarter number and they that analysed this to get to this 15 000 billion, which is esentially 15,294.3 trillion dollars of GDP.

6
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:36,168
Let's say the GDP deflator, relative to 2010, you always have to know what you're taking your deflator relative to,

7
00:00:36,168 --> 00:00:43,603
is a 102.5 and this is, once again, the 2011 GDP deflator.

8
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:53,028
And one way to interprate this is if the base year is 2010, that means that prices in 2010 could be viewed as being at 100

9
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:57,937
and that now, we're in 2011, we're in 102.5.

10
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:04,200
Another way to think about is that generall level of prices, that we have talked about it, this is not an easy thing to measure

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:12,604
But if attempted to that the generall level of prices has gone up by 2.5 %, when form 100 to 102.5.

12
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:19,800
Now that is the way that we know the nominal GDP is, the GDP measured in 2011 dollars,ofen called the current dollar GDP.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,669
We know the deflator is, can we figure out the real GDP in 2011

14
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:31,936
and that will be the real GDP in 2010 dollars, when we have the deflator relative to 2010.

15
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:43,468
So to do that we just have to remember that the ratio between our nominal GDP and our real GDP is going to be the ratio,

16
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:49,604
you can viewed as current dollar vs. 2010 dollars.

17
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:58,509
Or another way of viewing it, is the ratio between our deflator, which is 102.5

18
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:04,409
and 100, which is esentially you could use it as kind of deflator in 2010

19
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,173
or just setting that level of prices to be 100, a prices now are 102.5 .

20
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:20,503
So taking it in that way, our nominal current dollar GDP is 15 294.3 billion dollars

21
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:24,420
we can viewed that it's 15.2943 trillion, eiter way.

22
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,647
Our real GDP is what we want to figure out.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,467
We do not know what it is.

24
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:32,741
But we know the deflator, we know that things are gotten 102.5 more expensive

25
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:38,603
or that deflator is a 102.5.

26
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:43,543
And then we can just solve for the real GDP.

27
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,133
And the 102.5 over 100, you might be able do this in your head,

28
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:52,672
this whole expression right over here just becomes 1.025.

29
00:02:52,672 --> 00:03:04,335
And so you have this 15 trillions divided by 1.025 or you can divide both sides by 1.025

30
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:07,542
and multiply both sides by the real GDP.

31
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:25,277
So let's do that. Multiply both sides by the real GDP, divide both sides by 1.025.

32
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:30,532
Now, of course, this cancels with that, that why we have multiplay both sides by the real,

33
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:35,937
And then this cancels with that and we get our real GDP.

34
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:46,866
Our real GDP is equal to our current dollar GDP.

35
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:58,587
15 294.3 billion dollars divided by essentially the ratio between our deflator and the 100, divided by 1.025.

36
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:04,916
If I were in charge of naming macroeconomic concepts I would actually made this the deflator

37
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:12,200
I would set this at 1 and I would call this 1.205, because then you wouldn't had all this sillines multiplaing and dividing by 100.

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,916
You just say: Hey, let's take our current dollar GDP, divide it by the deflator, I guess you could say world - deflated, to get the real GDP.

39
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,669
That's just make a lot of sense to me.

40
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,604
But either way, that's essencially what simplify too, this is our current dollar GDP, our nominal GDP

41
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:32,800
dividing it by, what I would prefer to call the deflator, but you could use it as the deflator divided by 100

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,810
and that gave us a real GDP.

43
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,084
We just deflating the current dollar one, and how many the calculate to figure this one out.

44
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:58,604
So let's get the calculator out, so 15 294.3, this is in billions, divided by 1.025, gives us 14 921.3

45
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:04,469
So let me take this to the screen that I can remember that says. I have a bad memory.

46
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:27,855
This is our real GDP, our real GDP is equal to 14 921.3 billion dollars.

47
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:41,500
You can also write 14.9213 trillion dollars.
