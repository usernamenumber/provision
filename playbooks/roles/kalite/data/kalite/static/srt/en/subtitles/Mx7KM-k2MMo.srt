1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,930
What I want to do in this video
is differentiate between

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:13,520
the ideas of nucleophilicity or
how strong of a nucleophile

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,100
something is, and basicity.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,170
   

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,720
The difference is at one level
subtle, but it's actually a

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,800
very big difference.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,770
And I'll show you why it's kind
of confusing the first

9
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,780
time you learn it.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,860
When we studied Sn2 reactions,
you have a nucleophile that

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,030
has an extra electron
right here.

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,200
It has a negative charge.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,510
And maybe you have
a methyl carbon.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,600
   

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
Let me draw it.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,430
Maybe you have a hydrogen
coming out.

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,740
You have a hydrogen behind it.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,980
You have a hydrogen up top.

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,850
Then you have a leaving group
right over there.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,570
In an Sn2 reaction, the
nucleophile will give this

21
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,300
electron to the carbon.

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,090
The carbon has a partial
positive charge.

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,460
Let me draw that.

24
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,260
The leaving group has a partial
negative charge

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,630
because it tends to be or will
be more electronegative.

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,370
So this electron is given to
this carbon right when the

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,960
carbon gets that, or
simultaneously with it, this

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,090
electronegative leaving group
is able to completely take

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,830
this electron away
from the carbon.

30
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,370
Then after you are done,
it looks like this.

31
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,910
We have our methyl carbon so the
hydrogen is in the back,

32
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,330
hydrogen in the front,
hydrogen on top.

33
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,150
The leaving group has left.

34
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,150
It had this electron right
there, but now it also took

35
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,910
that magenta electron so it now
has a negative charge and

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:02:00,650
the nucleophile has given this
electron right over here and

37
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,060
so now it is bonded
to the carbon.

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,450
The whole reason I did this is
because this is acting as a

39
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,100
nucleophile.

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,139
It loves nucleuses.

41
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,420
It's giving away its extra
electron, but it is also

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,695
acting as a Lewis base.

43
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:17,450
   

44
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,620
This is a bit of a refresher.

45
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,830
A Lewis base, which is really
the most general, or I guess

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,630
it covers the most examples of
what it means to be a base.

47
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,410
a Lewis base means you are
an electron donor.

48
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,370
   

49
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,700
That's exactly what's
happening here.

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,170
This nucleophile is donating
an electron to the carbon.

51
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,760
So, it's acting like
a Lewis base.

52
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,460
So for the first time you see
that, you're like, well, why

53
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,310
did chemists even go through the
pain of defining something

54
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,220
like a nucleophile?

55
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,840
Why don't they just
call it a base?

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Why are there two different
concepts of nucleophilicity

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,100
and basicity?

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,000
The difference is that
nucleophilicity is a kinetic

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,470
concept, which means how
good is it at reacting?

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,900
How fast is it at reacting?

61
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,870
How little extra energy
does it need to react?

62
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,890
When something has good
nucleophilicity,

63
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,140
it is good it reacting.

64
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,520
   

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,830
It doesn't tell you anything
about how stable or unstable

66
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,680
the reactants before and after
are, It just tells you they're

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,880
good at reacting with
each other.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,435
Basicity is a thermodynamic
concept.

69
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:30,320
   

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,910
It's telling you how stable
the reactants or

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,880
the products are.

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:44,876
It tells you how badly something
would like to react.

73
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:52,520
   

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,800
For example, we saw the
situation of fluorine.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,580
Let's think about this.

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,760
We saw the situation-- actually,
I should say

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,170
fluoride, so fluoride
looks like this.

78
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,380
Seven valence electrons for
fluorine and then it swiped

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,650
one extra electron away.

80
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,710
You get fluoride.

81
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,470
So fluoride is reasonably
basic.

82
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,649
It is more basic than iodide.

83
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:28,550
   

84
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,490
But in a protic solution--
let me write it here.

85
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:46,080
But less nucleophilic
in protic solution.

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,960
And a protic solution,
once again, has

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,290
hydrogen protons around.

88
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,840
And the reason why this is, is
fluoride, it wants to bond

89
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,910
with a carbon or something else
more badly, or maybe even

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,910
a hydrogen proton.

91
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,370
It wants to bond with it more
badly than an iodide anion.

92
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,050
If it did, it actually will be
a stronger bond than the

93
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,250
iodide anion will form, that the
fluoride anion is actually

94
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,270
less stable in this form
than the iodide is.

95
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,970
If it were to be able to get a
proton or give its electron

96
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,440
away, it will be happier, but
it's less nucleophilic.

97
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,820
It's less good at reacting
in a protic solution.

98
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,060
The whole reason it's less
nucleophilic is because there

99
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,330
are other things that are
keeping it from reacting.

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,145
We saw in the video on what
makes a good nucleophile, and

101
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:36,280
in the case of fluoride,
it's because it's

102
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,015
a very small atom.

103
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:43,140
It's actually a very small ion
so it's very closely held.

104
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,250
The electron cloud is very
tight, and so what it allows

105
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,570
is the hydrogens from the water
to form a very tight

106
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,300
shell around.

107
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,860
These all have partial positive
charges so they're

108
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,790
attracted to the
negative anion.

109
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,420
They form a very tight shell
protecting the fluoride anion,

110
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,100
which makes it harder for it to
react in a protic solution,

111
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,020
so it doesn't react as well.

112
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,680
   

113
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,180
If it was able to react, it
actually will form a stronger

114
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,570
bond than the iodide anion.

115
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,760
So that's the big difference,
just so we see the

116
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,020
difference in trends.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,310
So basicity, it does not
matter what your actual

118
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,040
solvent is.

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,390
It is a thermodynamic property
of the molecule or

120
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,250
the atom of the anion.

121
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:44,050
So if you looked at pure
basicity, the strongest base

122
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,070
you see-- and I'll just
write hydroxide here.

123
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,720
It's normally something like
sodium hydroxide or potassium

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,150
hydroxide, but when you dissolve
it in something like

125
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,130
water the sodium and the
hydroxide separates, and it's

126
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,700
really the hydroxide that acting
as a base, something

127
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,540
that wants to donate
electrons.

128
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:06,150
So hydroxide is a much stronger
base than fluoride,

129
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,350
which is a stronger base than
chloride, which is a stronger

130
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,850
base than bromide, which is a
stronger base than iodide.

131
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,880
Now, if you were to look at
nucleophilicity just to see

132
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,220
the difference, we saw that what
the solvent is actually

133
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,600
matters because the solvent will
affect how good something

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,616
is at reacting.

135
00:07:31,616 --> 00:07:35,390
So in nucleophilicity, there's
a difference between a protic

136
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,960
solvent and an aprotic
solvent.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,990
In a protic solvent, the
thing that has the best

138
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,490
nucleophilicity is actually
iodide because it's not

139
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,010
hindered by these hydrogen
bonds as much.

140
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,950
It doesn't have a tight shell.

141
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,590
It has this big molecular cloud,
and some people think

142
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,090
it also has kind
of a softness.

143
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,370
It has this polarized ability
where that cloud can be pulled

144
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,420
towards the carbon and do
what it needs to do.

145
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,900
So in this case, iodide is a
better nucleophile, let me

146
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,950
just say, than hydroxide, which
is a better nucleophile

147
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,320
than fluorine.

148
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,090
Now, in an aprotic solution,
where all of a sudden the

149
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,270
interactions with the solvent
are not going to be as

150
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,710
significant, then
things change.

151
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,960
In this situation,
basicity matters.

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,600
So in an aprotic solution,
basicity and

153
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,039
nucleophilicity correlate.

154
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:48,710
I'll put an asterisk here
because there's also one other

155
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,050
aspect of nucleophilicty that
I haven't talked about yet,

156
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,790
but I'll talk about
it in a second.

157
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,640
In this type of a situation,
hydroxide will be better at

158
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,310
reacting than fluoride, which
would be better at reacting

159
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,160
than iodide.

160
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,080
And the whole reason why in both
situations hydroxide is--

161
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,730
I mean, even when it can
interact with the solvent,

162
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,470
it's still a pretty good
nucleophile, because if you

163
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,700
think about hydroxide, and I
have to think about this a

164
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,530
lot, it has an extra electron.

165
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,960
If you think about it, you could
imagine it's water that

166
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,650
took away-- let me
draw it this way.

167
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,660
You can imagine it's water where
a proton left or where

168
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,750
an electron was taken from a
proton, so normally, you'd

169
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,860
have two pairs and now you have
a third pair right here.

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,080
This oxygen has one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

171
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,970
valence electrons, one more than
neutral oxygen, so it has

172
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,310
a negative charge.

173
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,220
It already has an extra electron
that gives this

174
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,580
negative charge, but oxygen is
also more electronegative than

175
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,130
hydrogen, so it's also able to
get this guy involved a little

176
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,370
bit anyway.

177
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,010
It's a very basic molecule.

178
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,520
So even when it might be
interfered a little bit by a

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,670
protic environment like water,
it's still a better

180
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,050
nucleophile than something
like fluoride.

181
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,680
If you take the solvent out of
the picture, it's a super

182
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,310
strong base.

183
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,060
It's also going to be a very,
very good nucleophile.

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,250
Now, the last aspect of
nucleophilicity, remember,

185
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,930
nucleophilicity is how good
something reacts.

186
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,250
Now, let's imagine we
have something here.

187
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,390
We have two hydroxide
molecules, right?

188
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,010
   

189
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,680
Let's say that this one is just
a straight-up hydroxide.

190
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,590
And let's say this one over
here has all sorts of

191
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,950
things off of it.

192
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,760
Let's say it has this
big chain of stuff.

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,110
I don't know which one.

194
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,190
Now if you were to look at these
two molecules, if you

195
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,210
were to try to guess which one
is going to be a better

196
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,820
nucleophile, you should just
remember: nucleophilicity is

197
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,290
how good something reacts, how
good is it getting in there

198
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,160
and making a reaction happen.

199
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,910
This thing has this big molecule
all around it.

200
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,000
It might actually make it very
hard, if you go back to this

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
circumstance up here, it might
make it very hard for it to

202
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,770
get in there.

203
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,090
We've talked about steric
hindrance from the point of

204
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,040
view of the carbon, but we
haven't really talked about it

205
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,820
from the point of view
the nucleophile.

206
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,270
In this nucleophile right here,
it might be hard for

207
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:39,050
this extra electron right
here to actually get

208
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,290
to the target nucleus.

209
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,310
It will be hindered.

210
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,870
While in this situation, it
will be much easier, even

211
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,220
though the group that's
reacting, this oxygen that has

212
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,540
a negative charge, this extra
electron, is on some level

213
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,600
fairly, fairly equivalent.

214
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,120
But this one right here is
a much smaller molecule.

215
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,930
It'll be less hindered,
easier to get in.

216
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,320
So this'll be a better
nucleophile.

217
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,150
   

218
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,960
And that's why I didn't want to
make the strong statement

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,880
that in an aprotic solution,
basicity and nucleophilicity

220
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,530
are completely correlated,
because nucleophilicity still

221
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,050
has that other element of
how hindered is it.

222
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,720
Is it in an environment or is
it part of a molecule that

223
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
will keep it from reacting even
though it might be a very

224
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,420
strong base?

225
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,470
If it actually forms a bond,
it'll be very strong.

226
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,830
The big thing to remember
is that they're just two

227
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,810
fundamentally different concepts
and that's why there

228
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,750
are two different
terms for them.

229
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,850
Nucleophilicity, how good is it
at reacting, saying nothing

230
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,110
about how good the resulting
bond is.

231
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,860
Basicity is how good
is the bond?

232
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,570
How badly does it want to react,
but it doesn't say how

233
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,540
good is it at reacting itself.

234
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:46,999
