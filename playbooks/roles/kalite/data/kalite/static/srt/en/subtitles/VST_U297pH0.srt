1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,330
We have company ABCD trading at $50 a share

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,220
Let's draw a payoff diagram for a put option

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,780
with a $50 strike price trading at $10

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,170
So once again we get to draw two types of payoff diagrams

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,650
One type that only cares about the value of

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,630
the option at expiration.

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,780
This is what you tend to see in academic settings

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,270
like business schools or textbooks.

9
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,480
And the other one will actually draw a profit

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,390
and loss based-on that option position,

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,840
so incorporate the price you actually paid for the option.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,990
You tend to see this more in practice.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,500
So you have a put option.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,990
Remember, this is the right to sell the stock at $50.

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,280
So the stock let's say at expiration.

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,900
All of these are at expiration.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,140
At expiration the stock is trading at $0,

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,040
the company went bankrupt.

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,850
Now it's worthless. What is the put option worth?

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,010
You would now go on the market, buy it for almost $0 ,

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,510
and then you would exercise your put option

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,140
and then you would sell it for $50.

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,810
So you would definitely excerise it,

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,640
and you'd make a lot of money the underlying stock

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,620
can be bought for $0,

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,470
the put option is now worth $50,

27
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,430
because you can buy it for 0 and sell it for 50 dollars.

28
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,760
if you have the put option.

29
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,520
If the underlying stock price is $10,

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,630
then you could still go to buy the stock for $10.

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,060
If you had the option,

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,390
you would excercise the option to sell it for $50,

33
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,760
so you would make $40.

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,070
So, the option would be worth $40.

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,540
And anyone who's holding the option would make instant $40.

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,630
So, the value of the option becomes less and less,

37
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,340
as the value of the stock becomes more and more,

38
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,720
up until you you get to $50.

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,020
At $50 you wouldn't really care

40
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,220
you have the right to sell something at $50,

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,120
which you could buy for $50.

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,100
So, it's kinda worth nothing.

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,110
The value of the put option could start at $50,

44
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,300
because you have the right to

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,600
sell something worthless at $50,

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,860
if the stock's going bankrupt

47
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,990
After $50, it becomes the option.

48
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,570
You don't really doesn't have any value anymore.

49
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,240
And if the stock goes anything above %50,

50
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,510
it's still worthless.

51
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,450
If the stock is $100 or something like that,

52
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,170
there's no way you could exercise the option.

53
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,050
because why would you excercise the right to

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,180
sell something at $50,

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,480
while in the open market you can sell it at $100.

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,520
Let's do the same thing for the profit/loss version.

57
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,220
So, the stock is worth nothing,

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,900
you can buy it for nothing,

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,260
and then if you have the option, sell it for $50.

60
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,440
But, we have to incorporate the fact that

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,470
you paid 10 dollars for the option.

62
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,170
So, instead of the option is worth $50,

63
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,620
we would say it's worth 50 minus this

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,780
So, it'd be worth $40.

65
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,190
And this is all the way you would exercise the option

66
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,980
all the way until the option is worth $50

67
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,790
But at $50, instead of saying it's worthless,

68
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,390
you have to remember, if the stock is 50$,

69
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,910
you wouldn't exercise the option.

70
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,170
But you did pay $10 for it.

71
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,680
So, you wouldn't exercise something that you paid $10 for

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,010
so you would have to take a $10 loss.

73
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,310
so the option started at 50,

74
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,720
and it'd become less and less,

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,630
all the way to the point that if you don't exercise it,

76
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,000
you would took the loss of paying for the option.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,730
not exercising it.

78
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,150
And any stock price above that,

79
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,760
you just took a $10 loss.
