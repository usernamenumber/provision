1
00:00:00,628 --> 00:00:04,306
Mary wants the fraction of pink blocks in Model B

2
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:07,604
to be equivalent to the fraction of pink blocks in Model A.

3
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:10,068
How many blocks in Model B need to be pink

4
00:00:10,068 --> 00:00:11,359
in order to make that happen?

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,004
So let's look at Model A.

6
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:14,463
So how many equal sections are there?

7
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:18,477
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 equal sections.

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,536
There are 5 equal sections.

9
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:22,765
And what fraction of them are pink?

10
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:25,013
Well, you have one of them, is pink.

11
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:28,136
One of the blocks is pink.

12
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:34,845
So one-fifth of the blocks over here in Model A is pink.

13
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:38,489
Now we have to think about how to make one-fifth pink right over here.

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:39,500
So let's think about it.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,605
So how many, first of all, total blocks are there?

16
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:45,097
There's 1, 2, 3...actually I'll use another color.

17
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:48,874
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

18
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:54,412
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

19
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:59,207
There are 20 total blocks here.

20
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:01,096
And you see this is the exact same length.

21
00:01:01,096 --> 00:01:04,677
Model B is the exact same length as Model A.

22
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,844
And so for every block that you have in Model A,

23
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:11,872
for every block here, you must have four in Model B.

24
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:13,769
Because we went from five sections

25
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,433
to twenty.

26
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,917
So we're essentially multiplying by 4.

27
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,209
And you even see it here.

28
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,514
If we were to just draw a line right down here

29
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,807
you'd see that for every block in Model A

30
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:29,018
you have 1, 2, 3, 4 blocks in Model B.

31
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:32,140
So one block in Model A that is with pink

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,581
would be the same thing as four blocks in Model B.

33
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,720
We would literally just multiply this times 4.

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,736
So four of the twenty will need to be made pink.

35
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:47,734
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

36
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:50,344
And you see that it exactly matches up.

37
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:55,143
This is the exact same fraction of the entire model over here.

38
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:56,198
So when they say how many blocks in

39
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:58,870
Model B need to be pink to make that happen?

40
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,000
It would be four.
