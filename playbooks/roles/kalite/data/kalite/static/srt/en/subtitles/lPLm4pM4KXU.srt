1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220
   

2
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:00,960
Welcome back.

3
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,540
We're on problem number 12.

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,400
If k is a positive integer, what
is the least value of k

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,330
for which the square root
of 5k/3 is an integer?

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,250
So this whole thing has
to be an integer.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,230
If the whole thing is going to
be an integer, the thing

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,680
inside of the square root has
to be an integer as well.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,270
The square root of a
fraction is never

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,620
going to be an integer.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,400
So 5k/3 is going to
be an integer.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,290
And we could also immediately
say that k has to be a

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:30,960
multiple of 3.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,479
That's the only way this is
going to be an integer.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,410
But let's think about what
type of a perfect

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,030
square this has to be.

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,650
This perfect square, it has
to be divisible by 5.

18
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,720
How do I know that?

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,360
Well, let's just rewrite
it as 5 times k/3.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,900
   

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,220
It has to be a multiple of 5,
and this has to be an integer,

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,470
which we just said. k has
to be divisible by 3.

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,820
The only way that this whole
thing is going to be an

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,540
integer is if k/3
is an integer.

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,670
So what is the smallest
perfect square that is

26
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,920
divisible by 5?

27
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,260
   

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,650
Because we want k to be the
smallest possible number.

29
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,700
The smallest possible integer.

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,820
So the smallest perfect square
that is a multiple of 5 is, of

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,060
course, 5 squared,
which is 25.

32
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,750
So let's set this equal to 25.

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:25,150
So 5k/3 is going to
be equal to 25.

34
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,680
Let's see, we can multiply
both sides by 3.

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,590
You get 5k is equal to 75.

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,090
Divide both sides by 5.

37
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,550
You get k is equal to 15.

38
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,600
And you can try it out.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,110
Put 15 in here, this whole
thing becomes 25.

40
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,780
And then the square
root becomes 5.

41
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,980
And they're all integers.

42
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,230
Next problem.

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,050
   

44
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,100
OK, they drew some boxes
or some shapes.

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,550
This one's 1.

46
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,170
And this one looks something
like this.

47
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,264
   

48
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,410
That's 1, 1.

49
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,020
And then this one looks
something like this.

50
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,490
   

51
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,340
This is 2, 1.

52
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,190
The figures above represent
three pieces of cardboard.

53
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,820
All angles of the cardboard
pieces are right angles.

54
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,070
Fair enough.

55
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,910
All short sides have length
1, and all long

56
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,090
sides have length 2.

57
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,900
Which of the following figures
could have been made from only

58
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,920
the three pieces of cardboard
without overlapping them.

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,200
So let's draw these choices.

60
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,150
So choice one looks like this.

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,990
It comes down like this.

62
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,950
This is 2.

63
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,610
This comes down like this.

64
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,750
This goes like this.

65
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,360
And this length is 3.

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,020
So maybe I'll try to fit the
biggest piece in and see what

67
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,860
I have left over.

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,240
So the only place where
that big piece can

69
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,490
fit in is right here.

70
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,330
   

71
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,420
That's the only place the
big piece can fit in.

72
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,050
And then I could fit
in the small piece.

73
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,710
I could put it here.

74
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,020
But then have no space.

75
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,430
That or that is not enough
space for this piece.

76
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,800
So one does not work.

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,050
Choice two.

78
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,170
   

79
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:18,142
So it has length 4 and it
goes 2, 1, like that.

80
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:21,520
And then it goes 2, then
it comes back.

81
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,730
So this is 2, 2, this is 1.

82
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,960
So where can I fit
the big piece?

83
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,585
Let's try that first. Well, the
really only place where it

84
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,450
will fit, because it's 3
wide, is right here.

85
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,520
This is the only place where
the big piece will fit.

86
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,200
   

87
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,970
And then where can I fit
the small piece?

88
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,410
Well, this looks like a pretty
obvious place for the small

89
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,416
piece, because, obviously, the
medium piece isn't going to be

90
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,250
fit right there.

91
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,550
And can I fit the
medium piece?

92
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,770
Can this piece fit here?

93
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,640
Well, sure, I just have
to rotate it.

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,460
And how do I know that?

95
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,970
Well, let me show, if
I can visualize it.

96
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,010
If I rotate it so that this side
becomes this side, and

97
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,530
that this side, right here,
becomes this side.

98
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,910
And then I could keep going.

99
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,830
I could say this side
is this side.

100
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,660
This is actually
strangely fun.

101
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,102
This side is this side.

102
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:18,269
And I think you get
the picture.

103
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,769
This side is this side.

104
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,380
So I think you get the idea.

105
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,050
I just rotated it.

106
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,290
So this one works.

107
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,780
Choice two works.

108
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,810
Let's look at choice three.

109
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,740
Choice three looks like this.

110
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,080
It's also 4 high, go out 1, down
step-- this looks like a

111
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,940
step-- goes down 2.

112
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,925
Then it comes out like that.

113
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:40,670
It comes like that.

114
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,580
And this is 4, 1, 1, 2, 1.

115
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,885
So where can we fit
the big piece?

116
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,730
The big piece is 3 wide.

117
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,970
So this is the only part that's
3 wide, but there's no

118
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,790
place to stick the bottom
part of the big piece.

119
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,670
The big piece could fit like
this, but there's no place to

120
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,610
put this part.

121
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,410
So the big piece, I can't figure
out a way to make the

122
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:58,930
big piece fit.

123
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,650
And I don't think it can,
because this is the only part

124
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,260
that's 3 wide, because
it has to be 3 wide.

125
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,600
So choice three is also
not the answer.

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,970
So the answer is two only,
and that's choice C.

127
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,220
Next problem.

128
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,850
   

129
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,230
Problem 14.

130
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,770
How many integers greater than
20 and less than 30 are each

131
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,860
the product of exactly two
different numbers, both of

132
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,200
which are prime?

133
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,020
Exactly two different numbers,
both of which are-- so let's

134
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,380
just list out all the numbers.

135
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,500
Between 20 and 30, not including
those two, because

136
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,810
greater than 20, less than 30.

137
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:48,110
So 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29.

138
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,770
So should we count 1 and
the number as factors?

139
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,830
Well, no, because 1 is
not a prime number.

140
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,710
Prime numbers are all the
numbers greater than or equal

141
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,330
to 2 that have 1 and itself
as the only factors.

142
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,510
So let's see how many factors
other than 1 and itself are

143
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,510
both different and both prime.

144
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,970
So this has 3 and 7,
and that's all I

145
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,610
can get out of it.

146
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,300
And these are both prime,
so this works.

147
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,330
This has 2 times 11.

148
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,280
These are both prime.

149
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,810
I can't think of any other two
numbers that divide into 22.

150
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,880
So that one works.

151
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,660
23 only has 1 times 23.

152
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,930
1 isn't prime.

153
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,140
I mean, all of these also have
the kind of identity factors,

154
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,550
so it's not 23.

155
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,110
24 has 2 times 12, and
6 times 4, and none

156
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,920
of those are prime.

157
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,690
So 24 doesn't work.

158
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,920
25 has 5 times 5.

159
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,500
Both are prime, but they're not
different numbers, so that

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,840
doesn't work.

161
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
2 times 13 goes to 26 and that's
the only factor, so

162
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,420
that works.

163
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,970
27 has 3 times 9, but 9 isn't
prime, it's a composite

164
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,520
number, divisible by 3,
so that doesn't work.

165
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,440
28 has 2 times 14, and 7 times
2 and-- so it has multiple

166
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,940
factors and 14 isn't prime,
so it doesn't work.

167
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,990
29 is prime, so it doesn't
have any other different

168
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,265
numbers, two different
numbers that divide

169
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:06,850
into it that are prime.

170
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,730
It only has 1 times 29.

171
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,760
It doesn't have anything else,
and 1 isn't prime.

172
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,290
So there's 1, 2, 3 choices.

173
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,330
So that's D.

174
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,360
I actually think this was a
little badly worded because, I

175
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:25,360
don't know, you could argue that
the number itself is a

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,890
factor-- or I guess the product
of exactly two numbers

177
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,810
and 1 can't count.

178
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,220
It has to be the product of two
numbers, and so you can't

179
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,740
count 1 and itself because
1 is not a prime number.

180
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,510
Both of the numbers
that make up the

181
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,620
product have to be prime.

182
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,940
Problem number 15.

183
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,190
So they drew this triangle.

184
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,960
   

185
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,580
They tell us that this
is 7 minus x.

186
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,580
This is 7 plus x.

187
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,480
This is 10.

188
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,840
This is 90 degrees.

189
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,750
And they say, in the figure
above is a right triangle.

190
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,490
What is the value of
49 plus x squared?

191
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,680
So let's do the Pythagorean
theoreum.

192
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,610
This squared plus this squared
has to equal that squared.

193
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,120
So 7 minus x, squared plus
7 plus x, squared is

194
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,870
going to equal 100.

195
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,170
This equals 49 minus
2x, plus x squared.

196
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,950
This is equal to plus 49 plus
2x, plus x squared, and that

197
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,300
equals 100.

198
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,260
This minus 2x and this plus 2x
are going to cancel out.

199
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,330
And now this is what?

200
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,750
49 plus 49, that's the same
thing as 2 times 49.

201
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,970
And then you have
x squared plus x

202
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,260
squared, plus 2x squared.

203
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,950
I could have multiplied this
out, but you'll see why I

204
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,550
didn't, because I want to
preserve that 49 in there.

205
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,780
And that equals, so this is
100, this equals 100.

206
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,950
Factor out the 2.

207
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,430
You get 2 times 49, plus x
squared is equal to 100.

208
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,050
Preserve the 49.

209
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,450
And then divide both
sides by 2.

210
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,790
You get 49 plus x squared
is equal to 50.

211
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,780
And we are done.

212
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,630
That's the answer.

213
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,350
That's choice A.

214
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,150
