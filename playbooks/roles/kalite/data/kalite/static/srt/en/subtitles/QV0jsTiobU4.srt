1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,670
I have this 4 by 4
matrix, A, here.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,120
And let's see if we can figure
out its determinant, the

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,530
determinant of A.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,370
And before just doing it the way
we've done it in the past,

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,530
where you go down one of the
rows or one of the columns--

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,890
and you notice, there's no 0's
here, so there's no easy row

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,250
or easy column to take
the determinant by.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,430
We could have gone down this
row and do all the

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,510
submatrices, but this becomes
pretty involved.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,740
You end up doing four 3 by 3
determinants, and then each of

12
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,880
those are composed of three
2 by 2 determinants.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,030
It becomes a pretty
hairy process.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,230
Let's see if we can use some
of the realizations we've

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,720
discovered in the last
two videos to

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,250
simplify this process.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,270
Well, one of the realizations is
that row operations, or if

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:50,470
you subtract-- let me write it
this way-- if you replace row

19
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:58,590
j with, let's say, row j minus
some scale or multiple, times

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:07,200
row i, it does not change
the determinant of A.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,300
We saw that, I think it
was two videos ago.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,880
So this is a pretty
big realization.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,810
We can do these type of row
operations and it won't change

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,700
the determinant.

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,730
The other realization we had
was that these upper

26
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,220
triangular matrices, you can
figure out their determinant.

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,940
So what does upper triangular
look like?

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,900
Let me just review it.

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,370
The upper triangular--
everything below the diagonal.

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,850
So let's say the diagonal has--
let me just draw its

31
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,710
terms like that.

32
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,380
These are some non-zero terms.
Oh, they don't have to be.

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,920
Then upper triangular,
everything below the diagonal

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,630
is a 0, and everything above the
diagonal probably isn't a

35
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,740
0, but you never know.

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,400
But they're non-zero terms, so
all the red stuff here is

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,940
non-zero, all this stuff
in green is 0.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,270
And I didn't touch on it in that
video, but there is also

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,630
such a thing as a lower
triangular, that you might

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,800
have guessed how it looks.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,370
Everything above the main
diagonal is 0, so this is the

42
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,810
main diagonal right here, all
the way down like that.

43
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,060
All of these guys are going
to be non-zero.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,730
All of that's going to be
non-zero, and then the 0's are

45
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,630
going to be above the
diagonal, like that.

46
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,660
We saw in the last video that
the determinant of this guy is

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,130
just equal to the product of the
diagonal entries, which is

48
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,050
a very simple way of finding
a determinant.

49
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,160
And you could use the same
argument we made in the last

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,540
video to say that the same is
true of the lower triangular

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,640
matrix, that its determinant
is also just the product of

52
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,170
those entries.

53
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,030
I won't prove it here, but you
can use the exact same

54
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,980
argument you used in the video
that I just did on the upper

55
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,300
triangular.

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,880
So given this, that the
determinant of this is just

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,780
the product of those guys, and
that I can perform row

58
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,250
operations on this guy and not
change the determinant, maybe

59
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,070
a simpler way to calculate this
determinant is to get

60
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,860
this guy into an upper
triangular form, and then just

61
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,360
multiply the entries
down the diagonal.

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,060
So let's do that.

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,085
So we want to find the
determinant of A.

64
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:15,210
   

65
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:15,870
Let me rewrite A right here.

66
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:30,740
It's 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4,
2, 2, 7, 5, 2, minus 1, 4,

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,650
minus 6, 3.

68
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,950
Now let's try to get this into
upper triangular form.

69
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,570
So let's replace the second
row with the-- so I'm just

70
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,630
going to keep the first
row the same.

71
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,790
1, 2, 2, 1.

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,900
And let's replace the second row
with the second row minus

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,230
the first row.

74
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,100
The second row minus the first
row is going to be equal to 1

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,960
minus 1 is 0.

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,610
So in this case the constant
is just 1.

77
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,530
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

78
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,120
2 minus 2 is 0.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,430
4 minus 2 is 2.

80
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,620
2 minus 1 is 1.

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,040
Now let's replace the third row
with the third row minus 2

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,560
times the second row.

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,390
So 2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

84
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,100
7 minus 2 times 2 is 3.

85
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,590
5 minus 2 times 2 is 1.

86
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,160
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,845
Let me get a good color here.

88
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,540
I'll do pink.

89
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,630
Let's replace the last row
with the last row,

90
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,870
essentially, plus
the first row.

91
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,410
You could say minus minus 1
times the first row is the

92
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,000
same thing as the last row
plus the first row.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,700
4 plus 2 is 6.

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,960
Minus 6 plus 2 is minus 4.

96
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,490
And then 3 plus 1 is 4.

97
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,220
So there we have it like that.

98
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,810
And this guy has two 0's
here, so maybe I want

99
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,530
to swap some rows.

100
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,920
So let me swap some rows.

101
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,200
So if we swap rows,
what happens?

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm going to swap the middle
two rows just for fun.

103
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,090
Well, not just for fun.

104
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,560
Because I want a pivot
entry right here.

105
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
I shouldn't say a pivot entry.

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,105
I want to do it in upper
triangular form.

107
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,965
So I want a non-zero
entry here.

108
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,370
This is a 0, so I'm going
to move this guy down.

109
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,770
So I'm going to keep the
top row the same.

110
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,680
1, 2, 2, 1.

111
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,190
I'm going to keep the
bottom row the same.

112
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,205
0, 0, 6, minus 4, 4.

113
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:46,630
And I'm going to swap these
guys right here.

114
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,150
So this is going to
be 0, 3, 1, 0.

115
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,630
And then 0, 0, 2, 1.

116
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,130
Now, can I just swap
entries like that?

117
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,520
Well, I can, but you have to
remember that when you swap

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,130
entries, your resulting
determinant is going to be the

119
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,810
negative of your original
determinant.

120
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,990
So if we swap these two guys,
the determinant of this is

121
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,200
going to be the negative
of this determinant.

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,110
When you swap two rows, you
just flip the sign of the

123
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,100
determinant.

124
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,660
We saw that.

125
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,370
That was one of the first videos
we did on these, kind

126
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,410
of messing with the
determinants.

127
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,200
Now, what do we want
to do here?

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,530
To get this guy into upper
triangular form, it'd be nice

129
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,820
to get this to be a 0.

130
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,520
So to get that to be
a 0, let me keep

131
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
everything else the same.

132
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
So I have a 1, 2, 2, 1.

133
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,240
I have a 0, 3, 1, 0.

134
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
The third row is 0, 0, 2, 1.

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,470
And now this last row, let me
replace it with the last row

136
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,270
minus 3 times this row.

137
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,150
So let me write it like this.

138
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,300
I have to carry that negative
sign as well.

139
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,700
So I'm going to replace this
last row with the last row

140
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,750
minus 2 times the second row.

141
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,610
want to zero it out.

142
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,830
So 0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

143
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,680
6 minus 2 times 3 is 0.

144
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Minus 4 minus 2 times
1 is minus 6.

145
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,590
And then 4 minus 2 times
0 is just 4.

146
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,460
We're almost there.

147
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,040
Now we want to zero this
guy out, so let's

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,140
replace this one.

149
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,560
So I'm going to keep my top
three rows the same again.

150
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,150
And let me see if I can write
it a little bit neater.

151
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,800
So my first row is 1, 2, 2, 1.

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,010
My second row is 0, 3, 1, 0.

153
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,930
Fourth row is 0, 0, 2, 1.

154
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,540
And I'm going to take
the matrix.

155
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,960
I haven't written the
fourth row yet.

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,250
And, of course, the negative
of this is going to be

157
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,540
determinant of our original
matrix, because we had swapped

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,650
those rows.

159
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:00,790
But let's replace this last row
with the last row, plus 3

160
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,650
times the third row.

161
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,240
So we get 0 plus
3 times 0 is 0.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,710
0 plus 3 times 0 is 0.

163
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,220
Minus 6 plus 3 times 2 is 0.

164
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,740
4 plus 3 times 1 is 7.

165
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,620
And just like that, we have a
determinant of a matrix in

166
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,600
upper triangular form.

167
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,080
So this is going to be equal to
the product of these guys.

168
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,945
We can't forget our
negative sign.

169
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,950
Let's throw our negative sign
out there and put a

170
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,500
parentheses just like that.

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,039
This is going to be
the product of

172
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,030
that diagonal entry.

173
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,760
1 times 3, times 3, times 2,
times 7, which is 6 times 7,

174
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,130
which is 42.

175
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,710
So the determinant of this
matrix is minus 42, which was

176
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,100
pretty fast. This was a
pretty fast shortcut.

177
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,080
And it actually turns out it
tends to be computationally

178
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,580
more efficient to use these
takeaways to put things into

179
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,740
upper triangular form first. And
then, you know, if you do

180
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,300
swaps, you have to remember to
make the determinant negative.

181
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,910
And then just multiply
down the diagonal.

182
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,650
And we did that there, and
we got the determinant

183
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,250
as being minus 42.

184
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:12,275
