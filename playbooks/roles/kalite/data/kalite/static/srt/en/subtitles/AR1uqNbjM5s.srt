1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,480
Let's do some exponent examples

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,420
that involve division.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,340
Let's say I were to ask you
what 5 to the sixth power

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,370
divided by 5 to the
second power is?

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,700
Well, we can just go to the
basic definition of what an

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,420
exponent represents and say 5
to the sixth power, that's

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,470
going to be 5 times 5 times
5 times 5 times 5-- one

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,730
more 5-- times 5.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,030
5 times itself six times.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,720
And 5 squared, that's just 5
times itself two times, so

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,770
it's just going to
be 5 times 5.

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,380
Well, we know how to simplify
a fraction or a rational

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,620
expression like this.

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,470
We can divide the numerator and
the denominator by one 5,

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,900
and then these will cancel out,
and then we can do it by

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,110
another 5, or this 5 and
this 5 will cancel out.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,960
And what are we going
to be left with?

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,220
5 times 5 times 5 times 5 over
1, or you could say that this

20
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,540
is just 5 to the fourth power.

21
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,320
Now, notice what happens.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,060
Essentially we started with six
in the numerator, six 5's

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,580
multiplied by themselves in
the numerator, and then we

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,720
subtracted out.

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,520
We were able to cancel out
the 2 in the denominator.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,450
So this really was equal to 5
to the sixth power minus 2.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,020
So we were able to subtract
the exponent in the

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,620
denominator from the exponent
in the numerator.

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,610
Let's remember how this relates
to multiplication.

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,790
If I had 5 to the-- let me do
this in a different color.

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:41,570
5 to the sixth times 5 to the
second power, we saw in the

32
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:48,330
last video that this is equal
to 5 to the 6 plus-- I'm

33
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,970
trying to make it color coded
for you-- 6 plus 2 power.

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,670
Now, we see a new property.

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,370
And in the next video, we're
going see that these aren't

36
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,940
really different properties.

37
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,210
They're really kind of same
sides of the same coin when we

38
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,520
learn about negative
exponents.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,250
But now in this video, we just
saw that 5 to the sixth power

40
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:17,040
divided by 5 to the second
power-- let me do it in a

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:26,610
different color-- is going to
be equal to 5 to the-- it's

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,830
time consuming to make it color
coded for you-- 6 minus

43
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,580
2 power or 5 to the
fourth power.

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,420
Here it's going to be
5 to the eighth.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,095
So when you multiply exponents
with the same base, you add

46
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:40,830
the exponents.

47
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,270
When you divide with the same
base, you subtract the

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,870
denominator exponent from
the numerator exponent.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,250
Let's do a bunch more of these
examples right here.

50
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,470
What is 6 to the seventh
power divided by 6

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,710
to the third power?

52
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,060
Well, once again, we can
just use this property.

53
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,190
This going to be 6 to the 7
minus 3 power, which is equal

54
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,430
to 6 to the fourth power.

55
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,540
And you can multiply it out this
way like we did in the

56
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,680
first problem and verify that
it indeed will be 6 to the

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
fourth power.

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,460
Now let's try something
interesting.

59
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,350
This will be a good segue
into the next video.

60
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,140
Let's say we have 3 to the
fourth power divided by 3 to

61
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,960
the tenth power.

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,240
Well, if we just go from basic
principles, this would be 3

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,100
times 3 times 3 times 3, all of
that over 3 times 3-- we're

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,040
going to have ten of these--
3 times 3 times 3 times 3

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,920
times 3 times 3.

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,310
How many is that?

67
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,960
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,160
Well, if we do what we did in
the last video, this 3 cancels

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,910
with that 3.

70
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,790
Those 3's cancel.

71
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,570
Those 3's cancel.

72
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,740
Those 3's cancel.

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,590
And we're left with 1 over--
one, two, three,

74
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,730
four, five, six 3's.

75
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,090
So 1 over 3 to the sixth
power, right?

76
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,970
We have 1 over all of
these 3's down here.

77
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,029
But that property that I just
told you, would have told you

78
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:24,820
that this should also be equal
to 3 to the 4 minus 10 power.

79
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,010
Well.

80
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,590
What's 4 minus 10?

81
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,630
Well, you're going to get
a negative number.

82
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
This is 3 to the negative
sixth power.

83
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,350
So using the property we just
saw, you'd get 3 to the

84
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,670
negative sixth power.

85
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,400
Just multiplying them out,
you get 1 over 3

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
to the sixth power.

87
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,690
And the fun part about
all of this is these

88
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,100
are the same quantity.

89
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,930
So now you're learning a little
bit about what it means

90
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,520
to take a negative exponent.

91
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,040
3 to the negative sixth power
is equal to 1 over 3 to the

92
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,630
sixth power.

93
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,990
And I'm going do many, many more
examples of this in the

94
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,790
next video.

95
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,520
But if you take anything to the
negative power, so a to

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,110
the negative b power is equal
to 1 over a to the b.

97
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,230
That's one thing that we just
established just now.

98
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,770
And earlier in this video, we
saw that if I have a to the b

99
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:17,670
over a to the c, that this is
equal to a to the b minus c.

100
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,010
That's the other property
we've been using.

101
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,510
Now, using what we've just
learned and what we learned in

102
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:32,160
the last video, let's do some
more complicated problems.

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,630
Let's say I have a to the third,
b to the fourth power

104
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,180
over a squared b, and all of
that to the third power.

105
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,290
Well, we can use the property
we just learned to simplify

106
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,010
the inside.

107
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,800
This is going to be equal
to-- a to the third

108
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,650
divided by a squared.

109
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,110
That's a to the 3 minus
2 power, right?

110
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,190
So this would simplify
to just an a.

111
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,150
And you could imagine, this
is a times a times a

112
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,690
divided by a times a.

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,260
You'll just have an a on top.

114
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,080
And then the b, b to the fourth
divided by b, well,

115
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,630
that's just going to be
b to the third, right?

116
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,990
This is b to the first power.

117
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,810
4 minus 1 is 3, and then all of
that in parentheses to the

118
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,140
third power.

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,060
We don't want to forget about
this third power out here.

120
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,220
This third power is this one.

121
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,110
Let me color code it.

122
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,485
That third power is that one
right there, and then this a

123
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:30,990
in orange is that
a right there.

124
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,280
I think we understand
what maps to what.

125
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,850
And now we can use the property
that when we multiply

126
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:41,730
something and take it to the
third power, this is equal to

127
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:48,820
a to the third power times
b to the third

128
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,140
to the third power.

129
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:57,700
And then this is going to be
equal to a to the third power.

130
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,770
   

131
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,880
times b to the 3 times 3 power,
times b to the ninth.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,830
And we would have simplified
this about as

133
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,680
far as you can go.

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Let's do one more of these.

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,980
I think they're good practice
and super-valuable

136
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,150
experience later on.

137
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:33,220
Let's say I have 25xy to
the sixth over 20y

138
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:40,190
to the fifth x squared.

139
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,315
So once again, we can rearrange
the numerators and

140
00:07:42,315 --> 00:07:43,400
the denominators.

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,890
So this you could rewrite as
25 over 20 times x over x

142
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,940
squared, right?

143
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,170
We could have made this bottom
20x squared y to the fifth--

144
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,850
it doesn't matter the order we
do it in-- times y to the

145
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,140
sixth over y to the fifth.

146
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,470
And let's use our newly learned
exponent properties in

147
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,150
actually just simplify
fractions.

148
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,220
25 over 20, if you divide
them both by 5, this is

149
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,240
equal to 5 over 4.

150
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,990
x divided by x squared-- well,
there's two ways you could

151
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,880
think about it.

152
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,890
That you could view as
x to the negative 1.

153
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,080
You have a first power here.

154
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,169
So this right here is equal to
x to the negative 1 power.

156
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,169
Or it could also be
equal to 1 over x.

157
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,620
These are equivalent.

158
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,690
So let's say that this
is equal into 1 over

159
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,510
x, just like that.

160
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,900
And it would be. x
over x times x.

161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,050
One of those sets of x's would
cancel out and you're just

162
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,560
left with 1 over x.

163
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,160
And then finally, y to the sixth
over y to the fifth,

164
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,540
that's y to the 6 minus 5 power,
which is just y to the

165
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,230
first power, or just
y, so times y.

166
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,730
So if you want to write it all
out as just one combined

167
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,410
rational expression, you have 5
times 1 times y, which would

168
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,690
be 5y, all of that over
4 times x, right?

169
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,930
This is y over 1, so 4 times x
times 1, all of that over 4x,

170
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,240
and we have successfully
simplified it.
