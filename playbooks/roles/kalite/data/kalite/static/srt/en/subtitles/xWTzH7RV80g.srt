00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
[background music] We're in the Museum of Modern Art

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:06,536
and we're looking at Constantin Brancusi's "Bird in Space" from 1928.

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:08,618
Brancusi was a Romanian who worked

4
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:12,026
for almost his entire career in Paris.

5
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:14,951
He worked in lots of media and often pushed

6
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:19,455
the materials to really new expressions.

7
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:20,803
This is bronze.

8
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:23,791
It's bronze. It's been highly polished.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,786
So it looks like gold...

10
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:28,260
But it's not just bronze, because for Brancusi

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,746
the pedestal was part of the sculpture.

12
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:31,744
And it's got a stone pedestal.

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,611
It's got limestone below that and very often you'd see

14
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,212
a wooden pedestal even below that creating a hierarchy

15
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:42,175
of materials what he considered the most primitive to the most industrial.

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,101
It's kind of a Neoplatonic idea of ascending

17
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:47,866
from the material up to the immaterial.

18
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,676
I think that's exactly right.

19
00:00:49,676 --> 00:00:53,483
The reflectivity of the bronze drives that point home.

20
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:58,015
It is really about light and movement, right?

21
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:01,136
This is not a sculpture that is in any way

22
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,679
a literal depiction of a bird,

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,663
it's a depiction of this gentle organic arching

24
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:07,944
of this soaring figure.

25
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:10,254
It's not a bird in so much as a representation

26
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:12,560
of the thing that birds to that we love.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,814
As one moves around it and looks at it,

28
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:19,900
the light that reflects on it shifts and changes and flickers,

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,480
so it does have a sense of something almost kinetic.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,192
As if it were moving and soaring,

31
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,701
but it's not a propulsion that seems mechanical,

32
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:32,900
even though it's metal and we see it as an industrial material.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,183
There's a great story about this sculpture.

34
00:01:35,183 --> 00:01:40,451
This was included in a famous 1936 exhibition at MoMA

35
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,887
called "Cubism and Abstract Art"

36
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:43,813
and when this came over from France,

37
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:47,317
the customs agents kept it and wouldn't let it out.

38
00:01:47,317 --> 00:01:47,901
Why?

39
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,221
Because MoMA was claiming it is a work of art

40
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,662
and they didn't believe it.

41
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:54,971
This is 1936 and they thought it had some industrial use

42
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,251
and therefore could be taxed

43
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,883
and MoMA said "No, it's a work of art,

44
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,531
it should not be taxed"

45
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:00,999
and it was actually held in.

46
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,261
There was a court case about it.

47
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:04,909
But what purpose could this possibly serve?

48
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,614
If I remember correctly the papers suggested

49
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:11,500
it may be a propeller or a piece of a propeller.

50
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,105
It does really speak to the radicality

51
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:18,333
- which I think we forget - of just how abstract this is.

52
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,985
It doesn't really in some ways look so abstract.

53
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:25,077
It does suggest flight and upward movement

54
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:29,880
and we're used to things suggesting things like that.

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,554
