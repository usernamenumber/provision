00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,733
Read the problem.

2
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:33,533
So just to visualize this a little bit.

3
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,067
Let me draw a triangle here, just so we know what b and h are.

4
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:45,067
This distance right over here is b, and this distance is height.

5
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:48,733
Now they want us to solve this for the height.

6
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:54,533
So the formula is A = 1/2bh. We want to solve for h.

7
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,867
We essentially want to isolate the h on one side.

8
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:04,000
It's already on the right, so let's get rid of everything else on the right. I'll do it one step at

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,400
a time.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,867
You could kind of skip steps if you wanted to. The best way to get rid of 1/2 that's beging multiplied

11
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:20,667
by h is to multiply both sides by the reciprocal. Let's do that.

12
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:29,400
Let's multiply. Remember, anything you do to one side, you have to do to the other side.

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,133
The whole point of multiplying by 2 is 2 times 1/2 is one.

14
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:43,000
If we multiply on this side, we'll have bh. On the other side, we'll have 2A. We're almost there.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,600
If we just want to isolate the h, we can divide both sides of the equation by b.

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:01,400
You are just dividing both sides by b. And then what do we get? Well, the right hand side, the b's

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,333
cancel out, so we get h is equal to

18
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:17,533
2A over b, and we're done. We have solved this

19
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,667
formula for the height. I guess this could be

20
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:24,333
useful if someone just gave you a bunch

21
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,800
of bases and areas and said just keep

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,667
giving me the height for those triangles.
