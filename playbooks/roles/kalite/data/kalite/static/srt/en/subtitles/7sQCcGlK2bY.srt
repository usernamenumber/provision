1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,380
We saw several videos ago that
we can parameterize a torus or

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:12,670
a doughnut shape as a position
vector-valued function

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,980
of two parameters.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,820
And this is the
outcome that we had.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,000
I think I did it over
several videos because

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,050
it was a bit hairy.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,500
And I'll write our position
vector-valued function first.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,220
So we have r as a function of
our two parameters s and t.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,080
And then I'll review a little
bit of what all the terms--

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,430
what the s, the t, and the
a's and the b's represent.

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:37,550
But it's equal to b
plus a cosine of s.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,980
And once again, we saw
this several videos ago.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,420
So you might want to watch the
videos on parameterizing

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,950
surfaces with two parameters to
figure out how we got here.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,660
Times the sine of t.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,070
I'm going to put the s
terms and the t terms

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,440
in different colors.

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,860
Times our i unit vector.

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,960
I'll put the vectors,
or the unit vectors

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,640
in this orange color.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,470
Plus-- I'll do it in
the same yellow.

23
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:16,490
Plus b plus a cosine of s times
cosine of t times the j unit

24
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,270
vector-- the unit factor
in the y direction.

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:29,970
Plus a sine of s times the
k unit vector or the unit

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,940
vector in the z direction.

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,570
And in order to generate the
torus or the doughnut shape,

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,320
this is true for our
parameters-- so we don't wrap

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,820
multiple times around the
torus-- for s being between 0

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,940
and 2 pi and for t being
between 0 and 2 pi.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,680
And just as a bit of review,
we're all of this came from--

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,030
and I'm going to have to do
what my plan is for this

33
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,280
video over several videos.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,510
But let's review where
all of this came from.

35
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,640
Let me draw a doughnut.

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,360
My best effort at a
doughnut right here.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,850
That looks like a
doughnut or a torus.

38
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,720
And you can imagine a torus, or
this doughnut shape is kind of

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,130
the product of two circles.

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,790
You have the circle that's
kind of the cross section of

41
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,900
the doughnut at any point.

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,040
You could take it there.

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,370
You could take it over there.

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,320
And then you have the circle
that kind of wraps around all

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,930
of these other circles or these
other circles wrap around it.

46
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,030
And so, when we derived this
formula up here or this

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,790
parameterization, a was the
radius of these cross

48
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,230
sectional circles.

49
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,510
That's a.

50
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,890
That's what these a terms were.

51
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:55,340
And b was the distance from the
center of our torus out to the

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,520
center of these cross sections.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,080
So this was b.

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,530
So you can imagine that b is
kind of the radius of the big

55
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,170
circle up to the midpoint of
the, I guess, cross section.

56
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,760
And a is the radius of the
cross sectional circles.

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,410
And when we parameterized it,
the parameter s was essentially

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,810
telling us how far-- s was
telling us how far or where are

59
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,570
we wrapping around this circle.

60
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,450
So it's an angle from 0
to 2 pi to say where

61
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,620
we are on that circle.

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,680
And t tells us how much
we've rotated around

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,475
the larger circle.

64
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,720
   

65
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,650
So if you think about it, you
can specify any point on this

66
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,210
doughnut or on this surface or
on this torus by telling

67
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,390
you an s or a t.

68
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,870
And so that's why we picked
that as the parameterization.

69
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,470
Now, the whole reason why I'm
even revisiting this stuff that

70
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,500
we saw several videos ago is
we're going to actually use it

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,900
to compute an actual
surface integral.

72
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,480
And the surface integral we're
going to compute will tell us

73
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,140
the surface area of this torus.

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,340
So this surface right here is
sigma, like that and it's being

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,435
represented by this position
vector-valued function.

76
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:14,400
   

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,200
That is parameterized by these
two parameters right there.

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,540
And if we wanted to figure out
the surface area, if we just

79
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,270
kind of set it as the surface
integral we saw in, I think,

80
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,670
the last video at least the
last vector calculus video I

81
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,380
did that this is a surface
integral over the surface.

82
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,460
Here this capital Sigma does
not represent a sum, it

83
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,270
represents a surface of a bunch
of the little d sigmas--

84
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,270
a bunch of the little
chunks of the surface.

85
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,240
And just as a review, you
can imagine each d sigma

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,880
is a little patch of the
surface right there.

87
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,290
That is a d sigma.

88
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,400
It's a double integral here
because we want to add up

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,830
all of the d sigmas
in 2 directions.

90
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,000
You can imagine one kind of
rotating this way around the

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,190
torus and then the other
direction is going in the other

92
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,440
direction around the torus.

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,050
So that's why it's
a double integral.

94
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,230
And this is just going to give
you the surface area, which is

95
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,310
the whole point of this video
and probably the next

96
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,580
one or two videos.

97
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,150
But if you wanted to also
multiply these sigmas times

98
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,550
some other value-- there's some
scalar field that this is in

99
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,500
that you cared about-- you
could put that other

100
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,560
value right there.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,330
But here we're just
multiplying it by 1.

102
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,060
And we saw in the last video
that it's a way of expressing

103
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,100
an idea, but you really can't
do much computation with this.

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,750
But a way that you can express
this so that you can actually

105
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,290
take the integral, you say this
is the same thing-- and we saw

106
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,510
this in the last
several videos.

107
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,080
This is the same thing as the
double integral over the

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,610
region over which our
parameters are defined.

109
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,690
So it's this region over here
where s and t go from 0 to 2 pi

110
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,790
of whatever function this is.

111
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,760
We just have a 1 here, so we
could just write a 1 if we

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,530
like; it doesn't change much.

113
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,490
Times-- and this is
what we learned.

114
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,150
Times the magnitude of the
partial derivative of

115
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,310
r with respect to s.

116
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,010
The magnitude of that crossed
with the partial derivative

117
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,370
of r with respect to t ds.

118
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,250
You could take it in
either order, but ds dt.

119
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,460
So we saw this in
the last video.

120
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,570
What we're going to do now
is actually compute this.

121
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,060
That's the whole
point of this video.

122
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,340
We're going to take the cross
product of these two vectors.

123
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,580
So let's figure out
these vectors.

124
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,020
Then in the next video
we're going to take

125
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,780
the cross product.

126
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,520
And then the video after that
we'll actually evaluate

127
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,570
this double integral.

128
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,900
And you're going to see it's a
pretty hairy problem and this

129
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,745
is probably the reason that
very few people ever see an

130
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:42,330
actual surface integral
get computed.

131
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,470
But let's do it anyway.

132
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,940
So the partial derivative of
r with respect to s-- so

133
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,040
this term right here.

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,180
We'll do the cross product
in the next video.

135
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,030
This term is what?

136
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,240
We just want to hold t
constant and took the partial

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
with respect to just s.

138
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,060
So this up here, if you
distributed the sine of t times

139
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,940
b-- that's just going to be a
constant in terms of s,

140
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,160
so we can ignore that.

141
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,350
Then you have sine of t
times this over here.

142
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,570
So sine of t and
a is a constant.

143
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,680
And you take the derivative
of cosine of s.

144
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,330
That's negative sine of s.

145
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,210
So the derivative of this with
respect to s or the partial

146
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,580
with respect to s is going to
be minus a-- I'll write in

147
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,526
green the sine of t, so you
know that's where it came from.

148
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:32,870
Sine of t and then sine of s.

149
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,800
The derivative of this
is negative sine of s.

150
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,070
That's where that
negative came from.

151
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,790
And then I'll write the
sine of s right there.

152
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,090
   

153
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,180
Times the unit vector i.

154
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,310
That's the partial of just this
x term with respect to s.

155
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,050
And then we'll do the
same thing with the y

156
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,270
term or the j term.

157
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,230
So plus-- same logic-- b times
cosine of t with respect to s.

158
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,240
When you take the
partial [INAUDIBLE]

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,750
becomes 0 so you're left with
a-- well, it's going to be a

160
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,460
minus a again because when you
take the derivative of the

161
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,110
cosine of s it's going to
be negative sine of s.

162
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,890
Let me do it.

163
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,660
You're going to have a minus a.

164
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,810
This cosine of t.

165
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,960
Minus a cosine of t.

166
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,490
That's the constant terms.

167
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,260
Sine of s.

168
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,470
Just taking partial
derivatives.

169
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,945
Sine of s j.

170
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:28,730
   

171
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,790
And then finally, we take
the derivative of this

172
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,810
with respect to s.

173
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,980
And that's pretty
straightforward.

174
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just going to
be a cosine of s.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,362
So plus a cosine of s k.

176
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,490
Now hopefully you didn't
find this confusing.

177
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,810
The negative sines because
the derivative of cosines

178
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,090
are negative sines.

179
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,690
So negative sine of s.

180
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,290
That's why it's negative sine
of s times the constant.

181
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,290
Negative sine of s times the
constant-- the constant

182
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,163
cosine of t sine of t.

183
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:03,140
So hopefully this makes some
sense just as a review of

184
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,710
taking a partial derivative.

185
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,795
Now let's do the same
thing with respect to t.

186
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:10,990
   

187
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,240
And I'll do that in
a different color.

188
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,750
So we're now going to take the
partial of r with respect to t.

189
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,530
So the partial of r with
respect to t is equal to-- so

190
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,690
now this whole term over here
is a constant, and so it's

191
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,630
going to be that whole term
times the derivative of this

192
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,120
with respect to t, which
is just cosine of t.

193
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,910
So it's going to be b
plus a cosine of s

194
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:43,130
times cosine of t i.

195
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,980
And then, plus-- and it's
actually going to be a minus

196
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,400
because when you take the
derivative of this with

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,670
respect to t it's going
to be minus sine of t.

198
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:54,590
So it's going to be negative
and then let me leave some

199
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,810
space for this term right here.

200
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,150
Negative sine of t.

201
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,340
And you're going to have
this constant out there.

202
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,790
That's a constant in t.

203
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,230
b plus a cosine of s.

204
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,730
That's just that
term right there.

205
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:15,780
Derivative of cosine t is
negative sine of t times j.

206
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,150
And then the partial of this
with respect to t-- this

207
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,340
is just a constant in t.

208
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,910
So the partial's going to be 0.

209
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,195
So I'll write plus 0k.

210
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:25,970
   

211
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,130
Let me do all my vectors
in that same color.

212
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,290
Plus 0 times the unit vector k.

213
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,240
So that gives us our
partial derivatives.

214
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,770
Now we have to take their cross
product, then find the

215
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,930
magnitude of the cross product,
and then evaluate this

216
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,930
double integral.

217
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,460
And I'll do that in the
next couple of videos.

218
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,533
