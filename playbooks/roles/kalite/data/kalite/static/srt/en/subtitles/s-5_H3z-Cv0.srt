1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:07,428
Lets say i run some type of sheep farm or some type of wool producing business and in year one

2
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:13,728
i go out there and buy a bunch of sheep and i put them on some land and i go and buy the sheep for one million

3
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:19,511
dollars and i buy the land for 1.2 million dollars so we have 2.2 million dollars in assets.

4
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:27,095
Nothing confusing there .Now lets go to year two and think about how we want to account for the sheep

5
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,228
and the land

6
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,595
so one way we could say this the sheep are still there the land is still there

7
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:37,328
i paid a million dollars for the sheep and they are all still there so ill put on my books that the

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:43,012
sheep are still one million dollars and i paid 1.2 million dollars for the land

9
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:47,627
so ill put on my books that the landis one .two million dollars

10
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:55,444
so in this situation i have accounted for the sheep and the land based on their historical cost, so let

11
00:00:55,444 --> 00:01:06,060
me write this down this is based on historical cost .Now another and this is a legitimate way to account

12
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,878
for things especially if theres no other way to really think about

13
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:14,443
what my sheep or my land are worth .Look this is what i paid for them now lets say there is an active

14
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:20,474
market in sheep and you can get a sheep apraiser to come over to your farm to come and tell you how

15
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:25,126
much you sheep are worth andyour sheep appriaser comes and says wow your sheep are looking good but

16
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:30,492
theresbeen a big, id dont know,sheep epidemic in another part of the country so there's a sheep shortage

17
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:35,277
so your sheep are actually worth a lot more that they were last year and they say i think you sheep

18
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:41,692
are now worth 2 million dollars .so you say Hey wow! the market value of my sheep is two million

19
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:47,710
so you could say instead of putting one million there let me put two million dollars for my sheep and

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:53,708
lets say the land is also appreciated the highways gone by and someone wants to build a development

21
00:01:53,708 --> 00:02:00,142
nearby so theres the fair value of you land is also going up maybe its also two million dollars.

22
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:05,757
so both of theses so this is two million and this is two milllion so this right over here you could

23
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:16,075
view the market value or the fair value of your sheep. Now either one of these is legititmate ways of

24
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:18,091
accounting but its good to know the difference

25
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:24,192
This is historical cost accounting ,this is fair value accounting in general most accounting standard

26
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:31,557
board want people to report the fair value to market value as frequently as possible so its very easy to do if there

27
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:38,323
is kind of a market in that or you cannot get a apppraiser that can give you a pretty good estimate of what

28
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:42,757
these things are worth if that isnt around or if its just inefficient to do it then you probably want

29
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:48,140
to do the historical cost method so thats all the difference .Historial cost- how much yu paid for it

30
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,641
Fair value-whats the current market value today so it sound like very fancy words but its a pretty simple

31
00:02:54,641 --> 99:59:59,999
idea
