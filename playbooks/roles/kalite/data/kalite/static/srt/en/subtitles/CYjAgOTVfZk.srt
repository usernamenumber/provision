1
00:00:00,145 --> 00:00:09,345
Let's see if we can evaluate the indefinite integral 1/(9+ x^2) dx.

2
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:18,144
And we know that if you pattern a^2 - x^2, it could be a good idea to make the substitution x = a sin θ,

3
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,222
but we don't see that pattern over here.

4
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:23,868
What we instead see is a^2 + x^2.

5
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:28,857
And in this context, it tends to be a good idea -- it's not always going to work, but it never hurts to try out,

6
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:34,266
it's a little bit of an art here, to try out x = a tan θ.

7
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,313
But you might say, "Sal, why is that?"

8
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:39,865
Well, to make that substitution and see how this thing would simplify.

9
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:54,263
This thing would become a^2 + a^2 tan^2 θ, which is a^2(1 + tan^2 θ), and this right over here --

10
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,457
we could reprove it -- actually, let me just reprove it for you.

11
00:00:56,457 --> 00:01:04,542
This is going to become a^2 times this is 1 can be written as cos^2 θ/cos^2 θ,

12
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:14,980
tan^2 θ is sin^2 θ/cos^2 θ. And this is why I picked cos^2 θ as the denominator so that I can add the two,

13
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:24,936
and this is going to become a^2 * (cos^2 θ + sin^2 θ/cos^2 θ.

14
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:29,267
This numerator from the unit circle definition of trig functions becomes 1,

15
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:38,501
so this is 1/cos^2 θ, and everything simplifies to a^2 sec^2 θ, which might simplify things.

16
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,594
So let's see if we have what's going on over here; we could rewrite this,

17
00:01:42,594 --> 00:02:01,742
so 9 + x^2, you could rewrite as 3^2 + x^2. In this case, a = 3, so we want to make the substitution x = 3 tan θ.

18
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:05,857
And if we wanted to solve for x, you could divide both sides by 3,

19
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:18,580
because we later going to undo the substitution x/3 = tan θ, or θ = arctan, or inverse tangent, x/3.

20
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,565
Now we'll also going to have to figure out what dx is, we'll also going to have to figure out what that is,

21
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:28,949
so let's take the derivative, or we'll write it in differential form, dx is equal to 3 --

22
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:35,199
derivative of tan θ with respect to θ is sec^2 θ dθ.

23
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,799
So now it looks like we're armed with all of the things necessary to rewrite this entire integral.

24
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:51,358
It's going to be equal to the indefinite integral -- we'll going to have dx here, which is equal to 3 sec^2 θ dθ,

25
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:59,717
that's the dx. And all of that is going to be over this business right over here.

26
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:04,979
Our a^2 plus our x^2. Now, we already know what that's going to simplify to.

27
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:12,003
Our a^2 plus our x^2 is going -- since we made this substitution x = 3 tan θ,

28
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:24,216
it's going to simplify to a^2 sec^2 θ. So this is going to simplify to 9 sec^2 θ.

29
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:30,801
And you can essentially read -- go through this logic, you going to get 9 + 9 tan^2 θ,

30
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:35,540
factor out a 9, and you'll going to get 9(1 + tan^2 θ),

31
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,544
and so that's going to be 9 sec^2 θ. Exactly what we have here.

32
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:47,346
Lucky for us, we have the sec^2 cancelling out, you get 3/9 --

33
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:55,745
this whole thing can be rewritten as 1/3 (that's just 3/9) times the indefinite integral of just dθ,

34
00:03:55,745 --> 00:04:04,218
which is equal to 1/3 θ + C, and now we just have to put things in terms of x.

35
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:19,597
And we see, θ = arctan x/3. So this is going to be equal to 1/3 arctan x/3 + C. And we are done.

36
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:27,252
So now we know how to deal with cases where we might see something like a^2 - x^2 and a^2 + x^2.

37
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:31,534
It won't always work, but it might be useful -- it will definitely able to do this thing,

38
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:37,910
it might not always make the integral solvable, but it's not a bad thing to try.

39
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,910
When it looks like u-substitution isn't working, then you can look for these patterns and try some trig-substitution.
