1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's say I have some type of a block here

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
This block has a mass of 'm'

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,067
So the mass of this block is equal to 'm'

4
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:14,067
And it's sitting on this (you can view this as) an incline plane

5
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,333
or a ramp or some type of wedge

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,867
And we want to think about what might happen to this block

7
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:23,133
We'll start thinking about the different forces that might keep it in place

8
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:25,194
or not keep it in place

9
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,191
and all of the rest

10
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:28,867
So the one thing we do know is

11
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,267
if this whole setup is near the surface of the Earth

12
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:35,267
We'll assume that it is for the sake of this video

13
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:38,067
There will be the force of gravity

14
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,933
trying to bring or attract this mass

15
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,200
towards the center of the Earth

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,467
and vice versa the center of the Earth

17
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,400
towards this mass

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,933
So we're going to have some force gravity

19
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,267
Let me start at the center of this mass right over here

20
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:57,267
You're going to have the force of gravity

21
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:00,267
The force due to gravity is going to be equal to

22
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:04,333
the gravitational field near the surface of the Earth

23
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,000
we'll call that 'g'

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,067
'g' times the mass

25
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:15,200
Let me just write it as the mass times the gravitational field

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,533
near the surface of the Earth

27
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:19,533
and it's going to be downwards

28
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,333
we know that, or at least

29
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,533
towards the center of the Earth

30
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,667
Now what else is going to be happening here?

31
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,330
Well, it's a little bit confusing because

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,267
you can't say the normal force is acting directly against

33
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,867
this force over here

34
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:35,533
Because remember the normal force acts

35
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:37,733
perpendicular to a surface

36
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,333
So over here the surface is not perpendicular

37
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,000
to the force of gravity

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,002
So we have to think about it a little bit differently

39
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:47,000
than we would if this were sitting on level ground

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
The one thing that we can do

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,333
and frankly that we should do

42
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,600
is maybe we can break up this force

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
the force due to gravity

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,267
We can break it up into components

45
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:59,333
that are either perpendicular to the surface

46
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:02,200
or that are parallel to the surface

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,867
and then, we can use those to figure out

48
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,267
what's likely to happen

49
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,733
what are the potentially netting forces

50
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,733
or balancing forces over here

51
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,702
Let's see if we can do that

52
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:15,133
Let's see if we can break this force vector

53
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:16,333
the force due to gravity

54
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:21,933
into a component that is perpendicular to the surface

55
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,848
of this ramp

56
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,000
And also, another component that is parallel

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,538
to the surface of this ramp

58
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,733
I'll do that in a different color

59
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,667
That is parallel to the surface of this ramp

60
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,467
This is a little bit of unconventional notation

61
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,800
but we'll call this one over here

62
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,133
the force due to gravity that is

63
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,733
perpendicular to the ramp

64
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,133
with that little upside T

65
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,333
I'm saying it's perpendicular

66
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:49,733
Because it shows a line that is perpendicular

67
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:52,267
to this bottom line (this horizontal line)

68
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,400
And this blue thing over here

69
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,533
I'm going to call this the force

70
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:58,492
or the part of force

71
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,867
due to gravity

72
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,800
that is parallel

73
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm just doing those two upward vertical bars

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,867
to show something that is parallel

75
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,467
to the surface

76
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,800
So this is the component of force that is

77
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,667
perpendicular

78
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,867
component of force that is parallel

79
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,667
So let's see if we can use a little bit of

80
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,467
geometry and trigonometry

81
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:19,400
given that this wedge is at a

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,000
theta degree incline relative to the horizontal

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,067
If you were to measure this angle right over here

84
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,600
you would get theta

85
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,667
So, in future videos we'll make it more concrete

86
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,133
like 30 degrees or 45 degrees or whatever

87
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,733
But let's just keep it general

88
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,000
if this is theta

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
let's figure out what these components of the

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,067
gravitational force are going to be

91
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,400
Well we can break out geometry over here

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,933
This, I'm assuming is a right angle

93
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,467
and so, if this is a right angle

94
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:53,133
we know that the sums of the angles in a triangle

95
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,533
will add up to 180

96
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,600
so, if this angle, this angle, and this 90 degrees

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,733
(Right angles are 90 degrees)

98
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,786
add up to 180

99
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,365
that means that this one and this one

100
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,467
need to add up to 90 degrees

101
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,533
or this is theta

102
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:14,467
this angle right over here is going to be

103
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,207
90 minus theta

104
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,333
Now, the other thing that you may or may not remember

105
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,733
from geometry class is

106
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,333
if I have two parallel lines here

107
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:31,133
I'm going to assume this line is parallel to this line

108
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,133
and then I have a transversal

109
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,333
So a let's say I have a line

110
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,267
that goes like this

111
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,056
We know from basic geometry that

112
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,867
this angle is going to be equal to this angle

113
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,468
It's comes from alternate interior angles

114
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,254
And, we prove it in the geometry module

115
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,333
or in the geometry videos

116
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,412
Hopefully, this makes a little bit of

117
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,533
intuitive sense

118
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,533
and we could even think about

119
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:53,667
how these angles would change as

120
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,333
the transversal changes and all of the rest

121
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,733
But, the parallel lines makes

122
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:57,800
this angle similar to that angle

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,333
or actually, makes it identical

124
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,333
it's congruent

125
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,600
this angle is going to be the same measure

126
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
as that angle

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,641
So can we apply that anywhere over here?

128
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,333
Well we have (and it's not obvious)

129
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,610
This line is perpendicular to the surface

130
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,133
of the Earth

131
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,067
right over here that I'm knid of shading in blue

132
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,867
and so is this force vector

133
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,467
it is also perpendicular to the surface of the Earth

134
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,127
So this line over here

135
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,267
and this line over here in magenta

136
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:29,267
are going to be parallel

137
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,333
(I can even draw that)

138
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,267
That line and that line are both parallel

139
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,366
When you look at it that way

140
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,600
you'll see that this big line over here

141
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,570
can be viewed as a transversal

142
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,000
Or you can have this angle and this angle

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,933
are going to be congruent

144
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,533
They're going to be alternate interior angles

145
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:48,467
So this angle and this angle

146
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:50,133
by the exact same idea here

147
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,000
it just looks a little more confusing here

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,267
because I have all sorts of things

149
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,067
But this line and this line are parallel

150
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:58,267
You can view this right over here as a

151
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,467
transversal

152
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,667
So this and this are congruent angles

153
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,800
So this is 90 minus theta degress

154
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,067
This too will be 90 minus theta degress

155
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:11,267
90 minus theta degrees

156
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,933
Now, given that can we figure out this angle

157
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:16,867
Well one thing, we're assuming that this

158
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,800
yellow force vector right here

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,200
We're assuming that it is perpendicular to the surface

160
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
of this plane

161
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,667
or perpendicular to the surface of this ramp

162
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,533
So that's perpendicular

163
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,667
This right here is 90 minus theta

164
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,133
So what is this angle right here

165
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,800
going to be equal to?

166
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,733
This angle (let me do it in green)

167
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,533
What is this angle up here going to be equal to?

168
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,733
So this angle plus 90 minus theta plus 90

169
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:44,000
must be equal to 180

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,667
or this angle plus 90 minus theta

171
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,133
(Let me write this down I don't

172
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,267
want to do too much by head)

173
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,267
So let's just call it x

174
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,733
So x plus 90 minus theta

175
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:58,600
plus this 90 degrees right over here

176
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,200
needs to be equal to 180 degrees

177
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,667
We can, let's see

178
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,467
We can subtract 180 degrees

179
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,800
from both sides

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
So if you subtract 90 twice

181
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,733
you're subtracting 180 degrees

182
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,600
you get x minus theta is equal to 0

183
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,100
or x is equal to theta

184
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,133
so whatever the inclination of the plane is

185
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,400
or of this ramp

186
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,933
that is also going to be this angle right over here

187
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,600
and the value to that is that

188
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,333
now we can use our basic trigonometry to

189
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,200
figure out this component and this component

190
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,333
of the force of gravity

191
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,867
and to see that a little bit clearer

192
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:36,533
let me shift this force vector down over here

193
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,267
the parallel component

194
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,933
let me shift it over here

195
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,800
and you can see the perpendicular component

196
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
plus the parallel component

197
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,533
is equal to the total force due to gravity

198
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,933
and you should also see that this is a right triangle

199
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:51,067
that I have set up over here

200
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,933
this is parallel to the plane

201
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,000
this is perpendicular to the plane

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,067
and so we can use basic trigonometry

203
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,400
to figure out the magnitudes

204
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,333
of the perpendicular force due to gravity and

205
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,867
the parallel force due to gravity

206
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:04,000
So the magnitude

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,667
(let's think about it a little bit)

208
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:08,733
the magnitude of the perpendicular force

209
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,867
due to gravity

210
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,933
I should say

211
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,333
the component of gravity that is

212
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,800
perpendicular to the ramp

213
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
the magnitude of that vector

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,271
A lot of fancy notation

215
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,467
but it's really just the length of

216
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,057
this vector right over here

217
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:27,067
so the magnitude of this

218
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,133
over the hypotenuse

219
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,200
of this right triangle

220
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Well what is the hypotenuse of this right triangle

221
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,533
Well it's going to be the magnitude of the total

222
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:39,933
gravitational force

223
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,067
(I guess you can that)

224
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,600
So you can say that is 'mg'

225
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,467
We could write it like this

226
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,067
but that is really the

227
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,933
(Well I can write it like that)

228
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,333
And so this is going to be equal to what?

229
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:54,833
We have the

230
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:59,733
(if we're looking at this angle right here)

231
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,933
we have the adjacent over the hypotenuse

232
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,800
Remember

233
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,867
(Let's do this in a new color)

234
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,333
Soh Cah Toa

235
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,067
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse

236
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,400
So this is equal to cosine of the angle

237
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
so cosine of theta is equal to

238
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,867
the adjacent over the hypotenuse

239
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:22,000
so if you multiply both side by the magnitude

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,267
of the hypotenuse

241
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,000
you get the component of our vector

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,733
that is perpendicular to the surface

243
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,000
of the plane

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,533
is equal to the magnitude of the force due to gravity

245
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,133
the magnitude of the force due to gravity

246
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,667
times the cosine of theta

247
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,733
We'll apply this in the next video

248
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:46,267
just so you can make the numbers a little more concrete

249
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,467
sometimes just the notation makes it confusing

250
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,533
you'll see it's actually pretty straight forward

251
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:53,133
and then this second thing

252
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:54,467
we could use the same logic

253
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,667
we have, if we think about the parallel vector

254
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,733
right over here

255
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,000
the magniude of the force of the component

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,333
of the force due to gravity that is parallel to the plane

257
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,867
over the magnitude of the force due to gravity

258
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:11,267
which is the magnitude of 'mg'

259
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:15,200
that is going to be equal to what?

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,733
Well we have, this is the opposite side of the angle

261
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:22,267
and then, so then the blue is the opposite side

262
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,533
or at least its length

263
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,200
is the opposite side of the angle

264
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
and then right over here

265
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,733
this magnitude of 'mg'

266
00:10:29,733 --> 99:59:59,999
that is the hypotenuse

267
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so you have the opposite over the hypotenuse

268
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Opposite over hypotenuse

269
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse

270
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is going to be equal to the sine of theta

271
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is equal to the sine of theta

272
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or you multiply both sides times

273
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the magnitude of the force due to gravity

274
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you get the component of the force

275
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
due to gravity that is parallel

276
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is parallel to the ramp

277
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be the force due to gravity total

278
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times sine of theta

279
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(times sine of theta)

280
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and hopefully you should see where this

281
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
came from

282
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because if you ever have to derive this again

283
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when you're 30 years after you took

284
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a calculus or physics class

285
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you should be able to do it

286
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you know this right here

287
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you know this right here

288
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this right here

289
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can all of a sudden

290
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
start breaking down the forces

291
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
into things that are useful to us

292
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we could say

293
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hey look this isn't moving down into this plane

294
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so maybe there's some normal force

295
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's completely netting it out

296
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in this example

297
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and maybe if there's nothing to keep it up

298
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if there's no friction

299
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe this thing will start accelerating due to the

300
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
parallel force

301
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll a lot more about that

302
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you ever forget these

303
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
think about them intuitively

304
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you don't even need to go throught

305
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this whole parallel line and transversal

306
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and all that

307
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if this angle went down to zero

308
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then we'll be talking about

309
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
essentially a flat surface

310
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there is no inclination there

311
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if this angle goes down to zero

312
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then all of the force should be

313
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
acting perpendicular

314
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the surface of the plane

315
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if this went to zerop

316
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the perpendicular force should be the same

317
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as the total gravitational force

318
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's why it's cosine of theta

319
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because cosine of zero right now

320
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is 1

321
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so these would equal each other

322
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if this equalled zero then

323
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the parallel component of gravity should go to zero

324
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because gravity will only be acting downward

325
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and once again

326
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if sine of theta is zero

327
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the force of gravity that's parallel

328
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will go to zero

329
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you ever forget

330
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just do that little intuitive thought process

331
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you'll remember which one is sine

332
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and which one is cosine
