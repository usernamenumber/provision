00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,020
Problem 43.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,210
Mia found the area of this shape

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,010
by dividing it into rectangles as shown.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,190
Mia could use the same method to find the area

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,020
for which of these shapes?

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,990
What technique can we use to figure out the area

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,160
by dividing it into rectangles?

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,400
So let's see. What do we have here?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,330
Can we divide this into rectangles?

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,110
We can divide into a bunch of triangles,

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,030
but we can't divide this into a bunch of rectangles.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,790
Or we could have done it this way as well.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,690
There's multiple ways to think about it.

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,810
You could have it like this,

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,080
and you can draw a bunch of triangles like that.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,040
But you can't divide this into rectangles.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,020
This one here, you can't divide it into rectangles.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,900
You could divide it into triangles and rectangles,

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,010
but not necessarily just rectangles.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,040
And this here, I really don't know.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,610
It looks like there's some type of typo in my test.

22
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,910
Because obviously I could divide both of

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,080
these things right here.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,020
The way I'm looking at it, I see squares here.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,030
So obviously I could divide that into rectangles.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,560
But my guess is, if I had to guess,

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,010
is that this was a triangle, maybe, before.

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,230
If it was a triangle,

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,360
then I couldn't divide this into rectangles.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,540
But maybe this was something like this.

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,030
I don't know. I'm only guessing.

32
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,370
If it did look like this, then we could divide it into

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,290
rectangles the same way that she did up here,

34
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,970
and figure out its area.

35
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,480
So assuming that there was some type of typo in this problem

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm going to go with choice D.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,010
If choice D was supposed to look like a figure like that,

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,050
then you could actually divide it into a bunch of rectangles

39
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,000
Problem 44.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,080
Oh, I see. You know what these probably were?

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,970
These were probably to show us that

42
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,010
these are right angles right there.

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,070
So that that's a right angle, that's a right angle.

44
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,170
And maybe-- well, I don't know

45
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,050
what else they're trying to show us.

46
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,040
Who knows?

47
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,060
You see what I'm going at.

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,040
There's clearly some type of typo on that problem.

49
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
44.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,050
Simplify.

51
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,500
x squared minus 3x plus 1,

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,080
minus x squared plus 2x plus 7.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,060
So let's just write it out.

54
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,060
We have x squared minus 3x plus 1.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,740
Then we have to distribute this minus sign.

56
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,120
So minus x squared minus 2x, right?

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,570
Minus times plus.

58
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,610
Minus 2x.

59
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,510
Minus times plus 7 is minus 7.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,070
So you have an x squared minus an x squared.

61
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,020
They cancel out.

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,050
Right? x squared minus x squared is 0.

63
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,900
Then you have minus 3x minus 2x.

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,490
Is minus 5x.

65
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,090
And then you have 1 minus 7, which is minus 6.

66
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:05,030
So you're left with minus 5x minus 6, which is choice C.

67
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,000
Problem 45.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,890
What are the coordinates of the x-intercept of the line

69
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,650
3x plus 4y is equal to 12?

70
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,000
They want to know the x-intercept.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,010
Remember, the x-intercept, if this is a line--

72
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,050
and this is a line.

73
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,080
Let me draw the axes.

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,710
Say the line looks-- I don't know what it looks like.

75
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,380
Say the line looks something like this.

76
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:33,080
The x-intercept is the value when y is equal to 0.

77
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,000
The x-intercept is going to be some value x and 0.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's figure out what this x-intercept is.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,030
So we can even look here.

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,000
This is definitely not an x-intercept.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,050
This is a y-intercept.

82
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,640
This is a y-intercept.

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,660
In order to be an x-intercept, in order to be on the x-axis,

84
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,530
your y value has to be 0.

85
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,520
So the choices are either B or D.

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,050
And so if y is 0, let's just solve the equation.

87
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,730
So 3x plus 4 times 0 is equal to 12.

88
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,000
Or we get 3x is equal to 12.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's just 0 right there.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
So x is equal to 4.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,120
So the x-intercept is 4 comma 0.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,180
x is 4, y is 0.

93
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,040
So this is our choice right there.

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,060
46.

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,580
Which of the following statements describes parallel lines?

96
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,840
And parallel lines are just two lines that never intersect,

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,350
that have the same slope an

98
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,750
they don't sit on top of each other.

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,040
So those would be two parallel lines right there.

100
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,720
Same y-intercepts but different slopes.

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
No, I just said, they have to have the same slope

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,270
and they never intersect.

103
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,980
So they can't have the same y-intercepts.

104
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,030
So it's not that one.

105
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,350
Same slope but different y-intercepts.

106
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,440
That looks right.

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,000
They're parallel, but they're not on top of each other.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
Or they have the same slope.

109
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,200
Opposite slopes.

110
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,080
If they had opposite slopes, they would intersect.

111
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,610
Can't be that.

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,010
Opposite x-intercepts but same y-intercepts.

113
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,010
No, that's not necessarily the case.

114
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,020
So our answer is B.
