00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,467
“We now know a little bit about inflation, deflation.

2
00:00:03,467 --> 00:00:11,238
Now I want to introduce you to hyper, hyperinflation, and as the word implies, it’s inflation gone wild.

3
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:16,800
And the general idea how hyperinflation, or at least the cases that we’ve seen in modern times,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,009
how they’ve happened, is you have some type of a government just going wild with the printing press, they’re just printing a ton of money.

5
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:32,400
So the general cycle is they print money. Let me draw it this way, so they print, they print like mad,

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,467
they print like mad usually, because they don’t have any other way of getting revenue,

7
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:44,000
they print like mad that leads to prices going up, prices going up,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,667
and then because prices goes up, they have to print more in order to for them to

9
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:54,067
able to get the same goods and services or pay the government workers what they wanted to pay the government workers,

10
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,467
or pay the soldiers, what they wanted to pay the soldiers.

11
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:01,467
And on top of this, this is by self would probably drive the hyperinflation in and of itself.

12
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:08,220
But on the top of this, you can imagine, we’re used to thinking high inflation is five or ten percent,

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,333
but you can imagine what happens when inflation is five or ten per hour.

14
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:16,487
Because then, there’s no incentive to be actually holding currency.

15
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:21,067
Every second that you hold currency it becomes worth less and less and less.

16
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:25,200
And so what happens in the scenario like this is people want to hoard hard assets.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,667
So if the price of bread is going up by the minute, or by the hour, or the price of shoes are going up by the minute or by the hour.

18
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:41,133
The increase in prices is going to make people hoard things, I spelled “hording” wrong, hoarding.

19
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:45,767
Hoarding goes through the roof, and you can imagine if hoarding goes through the roof,

20
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:50,690
if the shoe seller doesn't want to sell his shoes any more because –or he wants to hold them a little bit longer,

21
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,667
then the supply of shoes are gunna (going to) down, and the prices are gunna go up even higher,

22
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,773
so hoarding leads even to higher prices.

23
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:01,267
If when people go to the bread market and there's five loaves of bread,

24
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,533
they buy all of them and then the next person can't buy any,

25
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,533
because they know the price of bread is going through the roof.

26
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:10,937
It just keeps getting worse and worse and it's all started by the

27
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:13,933
government kind of just going nuts with the printing press.

28
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,275
The three most famous examples of this happening,

29
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:22,600
probably the most famous one is what happened in Weimar, Germany,

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,733
after World War I, they had huge reparations to pay,

31
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,605
that’s what the Weimar Government would have argued was their main cause.

32
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:32,933
But they just printed money like crazy.

33
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:36,133
Some people said that they were almost trying to destroy the economy

34
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:40,533
so that they wouldn't have to pay reparations for what they did in World War I.

35
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:45,733
But this just gives you a sense of how crazy it was, here’s the end of World War I,

36
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:52,200
and they just printed money like mad and the inflation, it was pretty –it was- this isn’t the rate of inflation,

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,143
this is how much was it relative to a gold mark, so this is one gold mark, over here.

38
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:02,667
So by, only after about two and a half years it was over ten fold.

39
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:06,800
And this is a logarithmic scale. Each slash-year, this a factor of ten.

40
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,267
So by the end of 1923, you’re looking at this is what: not one hundred thousand,

41
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:16,400
not or not a million, not a billion, this is a trillion.

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,757
It had gone up a trillion fold in the span of one, two, three, four, five, or was that six years.

43
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:29,333
The other famous examples of this is Zimbabwe, from 1980 until 2009,

44
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,867
once again printing money like mad, and there’s some of their productive capacity went away.

45
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:39,400
This right here is a one hundred trillion Zimbabwe dollar,

46
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,333
and this shows you the Zimbabwe dollar relative to the US dollar.

47
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,933
And once again this a logarithmic scale, this is ten to the 30th power.

48
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:55,009
And then the largest or the most extreme hyperinflation ever was Hungary after World War II,

49
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,533
and this right here is a ten million pin go note,

50
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:01,600
just to give you an idea of what people were carrying around their pockets.”
