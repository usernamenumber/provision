1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,246
let's imagine we have a huge cloud of hydrogen atoms floating in space.

2
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:10,240
when I say huge clouds-huge both in distance and in mass

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,252
when we combine those hydrogen atoms it will just be this really really massive thing

4
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:22,918
well we know that gravity will make the hydrogen atoms attracted to each other

5
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:28,259
and you normally don't think about the gravity of atoms, but it will slowly affect these atoms

6
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:32,578
as they slowing draw close to each other-as they slowly condense

7
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:38,243
they slowly move towards the centre of mass of all of the atoms

8
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:42,841
they slowly move in, and so if we fast forward,

9
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:47,366
these clouds will get denser and denser and the hydrogen

10
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:53,847
atoms are going to start to bump into each other, rubbing up with each other and interact with each other

11
00:00:53,847 --> 00:00:56,819
denser and denser and denser

12
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:01,138
there is a huge mass of hydrogen atoms, so its temperature is going up

13
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:10,891
and they will keep condensing, and condensing, until something really interesting happens

14
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:16,928
let's imagine that they got really dense in the centre

15
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:21,247
and there is a bunch of hydrogen atoms all over, really dense

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,265
i can never really draw the actual amount of atoms here, just give you and idea

17
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:29,095
-there is a huge amount of inward pressure from gravity

18
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:32,810
everything wants to get to the centre of the mass of our entire cloud.

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,267
the temperature here is approaching 10 million Kelvin

20
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:44,234
and at that point something neat happen

21
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:48,553
let's remember what a hydrogen atom look like

22
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:51,758
i'm just gonna to focus on the hydrogen nucleus, which is a proton

23
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,736
if you want to think about a hydrogen,

24
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:57,888
it also have a electron orbiting around it

25
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:00,906
and let's draw another hydrogen atom over here

26
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:05,537
and this distance isn't to scale, and that isn't to scale either

27
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:10,844
the nucleus is acutally much much smaller than the actual radius of the atom

28
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:16,835
so we know from the columb forces, these electromagnetic forces

29
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:22,826
these 2 positively charged nucleus would not want to get near each other

30
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:30,489
but we do know that if they did get close to each other

31
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,507
under huge temperature and huge pressure,

32
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:36,897
and you were able to get the 2 close to each other

33
00:02:36,897 --> 00:02:42,238
then all of sudden the strong force will overtake, it is much stronger than the columb forces

34
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:52,176
and these 2 hydrogens- their nucleus, will actually fuse together

35
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:59,096
that is what actually happens, once this gets hot and dense enough

36
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,486
and now we have enough temperature and enough pressure to overcome the columb forces

37
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:05,086
and bring the 2 protons close to each other

38
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,903
for fusion to occur- ignition

39
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:14,599
the reason why fusion-i want to be very clear here

40
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:19,012
the reason why it is not ignition and the reason why it is not combustion

41
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:23,894
- not like your normal burning carbon with oxygen together.

42
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:26,588
the reason why it is not combustion, and it is ignition

43
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:30,489
and the reason why it is called ignition, is that when 2 of the protons fuse

44
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,922
the resulting nucleus has a slightly smaller mass

45
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:41,600
and so the first stage of this, you actually have 2 protons

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,514
under enough pressure- obviously it will not happen

47
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:51,898
there is enough pressure and then the strong interaction actually keeps them together

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:57,286
one of these guys degrades into a neutron

49
00:03:57,286 --> 00:04:00,676
and the resulting mass of the combined proton

50
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:03,400
is lower than the mass of each of the orginal proton

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,594
by a little bit-and this little bit results in a lot of energy

52
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,913
plus energy-and this energy

53
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:14,933
is why we call it ignition

54
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:21,898
and this energy provide with a bit of ourward pressure so that this thing dont keep collapsing

55
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:25,845
so once we get pressure enough, fusion occurs, and this energy provides

56
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:31,882
outward pressure to balance what is now a star

57
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:36,480
so now we actually have ignition at the centre

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,567
we have all the other molecules trying to get in

59
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,421
providing the pressure for this fusion-ignition

60
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,161
now, what is the hydrogen being fused into?

61
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,923
well the first step of the reaction

62
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:57,239
well I'm just doing the most basic kind of fusion that happens to stars

63
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:02,254
the hydrogen gets fused into deuterium

64
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:04,344
what is called heavy hydrogen

65
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:05,949
this is still hydrogen.

66
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:13,031
it has 1 neutron and 1 proton and is not a helium yet- it does not have 2 protons

67
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:19,158
and the deuterium keeps fusing and we eventually end up with helium

68
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,590
and you can see that on the periodic table

69
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,156
okay i have lost my periodic table i will show you in the next video

70
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:32,572
but we know that hydrogen in its atomic state has a atomic number of 1

71
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,809
and it also has a mass of 1

72
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:37,933
it has only 1 neucleon in its nucleus

73
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:42,239
but it is being fused, it goes into hydrogen 2, which is deuterium

74
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:46,558
which is 1 neutron 1 proton, which is 2 neucleons,

75
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:48,515
and that eventually

76
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:52,143
gets fused into helium - and im not going to go into that reaction

77
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:57,566
and by definition, helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons

78
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:04,099
ok we are talking about helium 4 in particular- that isotope of helium- it has a atomic mass of 4

79
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:07,039
and this process will release a ton of energy

80
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,589
because the atomic mass of helium is slightly lower than

81
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:17,765
4 times the mass of each of the constitunent hydrogen

82
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:25,242
so all of its energy from the fusion under super high pressure and super high temperature to happen

83
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:28,911
keeps the star from collapsing

84
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:32,133
and once the star is in this stage,

85
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:37,920
once it is fusing hydrogen in its core into helium,

86
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:42,239
it is now in its main sequence

87
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,401
main sequence star

88
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,454
and that is actually where the sun is right now

89
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:53,338
and now there is question -

90
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,914
oh what if there just wasnt enough mass to get to this level

91
00:06:56,914 --> 00:07:02,255
and there are actually things that cant quite reach the treshold to that level

92
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:08,186
there are are few things that dont quite fuse to this level so they dont quite generate the heat

93
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:12,890
or even smaller objects that just get to the point that there is just this huge temperature and pressure

94
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,094
but fusion is not actually occuring inside of the core

95
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:18,230
something like jupiter for example,

96
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,224
several mass of the gases

97
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,592
you will need to reach certain treshold of the mass

98
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,933
with the pressure and temperature so large

99
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,562
that you start with fusion

100
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:33,927
but the smaller you are above the treshold, the slower fusion will occur

101
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:37,921
but you are super massive, fusion will occur really really fast

102
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:43,911
so that is just a general idea of how stars form and why they generally dont collapse on themselves

103
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:49,577
and why they are this kind of balls of fusion reactions happening in the universe

104
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,918
and in the next few videos we will talk more about what happens

105
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,852
when the hydrogen fuel in the core starts to run out
