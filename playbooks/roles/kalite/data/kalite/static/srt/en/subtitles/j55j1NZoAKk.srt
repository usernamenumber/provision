1
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,688
One of the most interesting women

2
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,345
in all of Egyptian history.

3
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:11,082
Began her life as the daughter of a bureaucrat,

4
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:13,139
but would marry the pharaoh of Egypt.

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,904
She would then be demoted upon his death

6
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:17,706
and would simply be the Queen Mother.

7
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:20,879
But her son would then elevate her status,

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,272
substantially, making her divine, making her a goddes.

9
00:00:25,272 --> 00:00:28,037
So much of that history can bee seen

10
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:31,171
in this teeny sculpture of Queen Tiye.

11
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:32,836
There's a clear sense of her nobility,

12
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:36,344
even though she bagan in a relatively modest way

13
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,276
as a commoner, although of fairly high status.

14
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,709
She looks out and past us here,

15
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,419
and there's no doubt she's a queen.

16
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,079
She is completely unapproachable.

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,285
And we may also be getting a sense here

18
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:49,142
of what she looked like.

19
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:51,921
There seem to be some individual characteristics.

20
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,973
She seems to be a little bit older.

21
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:57,444
We can see lines extending below her nose

22
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:59,013
on either side of her cheek,

23
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:01,950
and there're some distinctive facial characteristics.

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,247
So perhaps we have a little bit of a window into

25
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,609
what she really looked like.

26
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:08,575
The face and neck are made out of yew wood, this beautiful dark wood.

27
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,811
The eyes are made out of ebony and alabaster

28
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,838
and then there are some other materials as well.

29
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,431
Gold and some of the semi-precious stone,

30
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:17,679
lapis lazure is visible just under the headdress

31
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,157
that seems to have been chipped away.

32
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:21,957
That's right, what we're seeing are in fact evidence

33
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,707
of these changes in Tiye's life.

34
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:27,419
Underneath the headdress, that we see her in now,

35
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:32,377
would have been a gold headdress that signified her status

36
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:34,702
as the queen, as the wife of the pharaoh.

37
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:37,644
And we can also see that in the two gold clips

38
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:39,075
that we see on her forehead

39
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:41,838
that are evidence of where that crown would have been worn.

40
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,016
There would have been a cobra placed there,

41
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,559
the insignia of royalty.

42
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,406
That was presumably removed when her husband died,

43
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:51,425
and she actually fell in status to that of Queen Mother.

44
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,951
But she was so important and so smart,

45
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,552
and her son depended on her so much

46
00:01:56,552 --> 00:02:01,811
that in order to have her be able to actively participate in politics

47
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,997
and the affairs of the Royal Court,

48
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:07,941
he elevated her status to one of a goddess.

49
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,226
And that's when this headdress would've been added.

50
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:12,608
This would have been spectacular when it was first made.

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,426
Now, it simply looks a little bulbous,

52
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:17,216
but if you look a little bit to the back right of the skull

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,449
you can just make out some brilliant blue faience beads

54
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,616
that catch the light and really shimmer.

55
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,669
That would've covered the entire headdress

56
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:27,835
and so she would have looked regal and almost celestial,

57
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,600
appropriate to a goddess.

58
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,325
Her headdress extends upward

59
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:35,279
where we see horns, a solar disc and chief feathers.

60
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:38,473
Now, that solar disc may refer to the religion

61
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:41,017
founded by her son Akhenaten.

62
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:45,446
Akhenaten got rid of Egypt's traditional polytheistic religion

63
00:02:45,446 --> 00:02:47,944
and established a monotheistic religion

64
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:51,914
centered around Aten who was symbolised by the sun.

65
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:55,438
The sculpture really does give us a sense of her importance,

66
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:58,346
her power, her son's respect for her,

67
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:02,047
and gives us just a little glimpse into the complexity

68
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,786
of Egyptian life at this high station.
