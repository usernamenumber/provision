1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,880
Let's do some equations that deal with absolute values.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,119
And just as a bit of a review,

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:07,650
when you take the absolute value of a number.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,680
Let's say I take the absolute value of -1.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,263
What you're really doing is

6
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:16,090
you're saying, how far is that number from 0?

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,620
And in the case of -1, if we draw a number line right there

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,310
-- that's a very badly
drawn number line.

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,230
If we draw a number line right there, that's 0.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,470
You have a -1 right there.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,230
Well, it's 1 away from 0.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,250
So the absolute value of -1 is 1.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,850
And the absolute value of 1 is also 1 away from 0.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,610
It's also equal to 1.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,500
So on some level, absolute value is the distance from 0.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,587
But another, I guess simpler way to think of it,

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,600
it always results in the positive version of the number.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:59,360
The absolute value of -7,346 is equal to 7,346.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,779
So with that in mind, let's try to

20
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:05,050
solve some equations with absolute values in them.

21
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,675
So let's say I have the equation

22
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:14,500
the absolute value of x -5 is equal to 10.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,895
And one way you can interpret this,

24
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,161
and I want you to think about this, this is actually saying

25
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:23,120
that the distance between x and 5 is equal to 10.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,750
So how many numbers that are exactly 10 away from 5?

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,430
And you can already think of the solution to this equation,

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,960
but I'll show you how to solve it systematically.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,510
Now this is going to be true in two situations.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,800
Either x -5 is equal to +10.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,630
If this evaluates out to +10,

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,610
then when you take the absolute value of it,

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,380
you're going to get +10.

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,130
Or x - 5 might evaluate to -10.

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,700
If x - 5 evaluated to -10, when you take the absolute value of it,

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,950
you would get 10 again.

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,280
So x - 5 could also be equal to -10.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,730
Both of these would satisfy this equation.

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,958
Now, to solve this one,

40
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,500
add 5 to both sides of this equation.

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,160
You get x is equal to 15.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,830
To solve this one, add 5 to both sides of this equation.

43
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,900
x is equal to -5.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,963
So our solution,

45
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:24,910
there's two x's that satisfy this equation.

46
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,890
x could be 15.

47
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,502
15 - 5 is 10, take the absolute value,

48
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,690
you're going to get 10, or x could be -5.

49
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,060
- 5 minus 5 is -10.

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,020
Take the absolute value, you get 10.

51
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,632
And notice, both of these numbers

52
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:45,750
are exactly 10 away from the number 5.

53
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,050
Let's do another one of these.

54
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,130
Let's do another one.

55
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,182
Let's say we have

56
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:58,580
the absolute value of x + 2 is equal to 6.

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,610
So what does that tell us?

58
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,132
That tells us that either x + 2,

59
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:07,030
that the thing inside the absolute value sign, is equal to 6.

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,380
Or the thing inside of the absolute value sign,

61
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,050
the x + 2, could also be -6.

62
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,910
If this whole thing evaluated to -6,

63
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,210
you take the absolute value, you'd get 6.

64
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,340
So, or x + 2 could equal -6.

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,880
And then if you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation,

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,850
you get x could be equal to 4.

67
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,780
If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation,

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,690
you get x could be equal to -8.

69
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,240
So these are the two solutions to the equation.

70
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,740
And just to kind of have it gel in your mind,

71
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,500
that absolute value, you can kind of view it as a distance,

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,940
you could rewrite this problem

73
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:50,410
as the absolute value of x minus -2 is equal to 6.

74
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,759
And so this is asking me,

75
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:57,590
what are the x's that are exactly 6 away from -2?

76
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,168
Remember, up here we said,

77
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:03,560
what are the x's that are exactly 10 away from +5?

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,990
Whatever number you're subtracting from +5,

79
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,560
these are both 10 away from +5.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,515
This is asking,

81
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,080
what is exactly 6 away from -2?

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,510
And it's going to be 4, or -8.

83
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,959
You could try those numbers out for yourself.

84
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,459
Let's do another one of these.

85
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,330
Let's do another one, and we'll do it in purple.

86
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:30,190
Let's say we have the absolute value of 4x.

87
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,430
I'm going to change this problem up a little bit.

88
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,390
4x -1.

89
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,583
The absolute value of 4x -1, is equal to--

90
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:40,200
actually, I'll just keep it-- is equal to 19.

91
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,769
So, just like the last few problems,

92
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:47,640
4x -1 could be equal to 19.

93
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,670
Or 4x -1 might evaluate to -19.

94
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,130
Because then when you take the absolute value,

95
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,800
you're going to get 19 again.

96
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,100
Or 4x -1 could be equal to -19.

97
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,970
Then you just solve these two equations.

98
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,945
Add 1 to both sides of this equation--

99
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:04,274
we could do them simultaneous, even.

100
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:08,510
Add 1 to both sides of this, you get 4x is equal to 20.

101
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,005
Add 1 to both sides of this equation,

102
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:15,340
you get 4x is equal to -18.

103
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,210
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to 5.

104
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,920
Divide both sides of this by 4, you get x is equal to -18/4,

105
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,770
which is equal to -9/2.

106
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,730
So both of these x values satisfy the equation.

107
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,587
Try it out.

108
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,580
-9/2 x 4.

109
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,570
This will become a -18.

110
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,200
-18 minus 1 is -19.

111
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,740
Take the absolute value, you get 19.

112
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,920
You put a 5 here, 4 x 5 is 20.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,960
Minus 1 is +19.

114
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,260
So you take the absolute value.

115
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,920
Once again, you'll get a 19.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,580
Let's try to graph one of these, just for fun.

117
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,283
So let's say

118
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:04,990
I have y is equal to the absolute value of x +3.

119
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,840
So this is a function, or a graph,

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,410
with an absolute value in it.

121
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,820
So let's think about two scenarios.

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,136
There's one scenario

123
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:16,430
where the thing inside of the absolute value is positive.

124
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,873
So you have the scenario where x + 3

125
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:23,420
I'll write it over here: x + 3 is > 0.

126
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,370
And then you have the scenario where x +3 is < 0.

127
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,658
When x +3 is > 0,

128
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,490
this graph, or this line--or I guess we can't call it a line--

129
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,690
this function, is the same thing as y is equal to x +3.

130
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,370
If this thing over here is > 0,

131
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,750
then the absolute value sign is irrelevant.

132
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,780
So then this thing is the same thing

133
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,280
as y is equal to x +3.

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,590
But when is x +3 > 0?

135
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,366
Well, if you subtract 3 from both sides,

136
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,910
you get x is > -3.

137
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,249
So when x is > -3,

138
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:08,460
this graph is going to look just like y is equal to x +3.

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,500
Now, when x +3 is < 0.

140
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,328
When the situation where this--

141
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:16,509
the inside of our absolute value sign--is negative,

142
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,356
in that situation this equation is going to be

143
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:26,250
y is equal to the negative of x +3.

144
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,540
How can I say that?

145
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, look, if this is going to
be a negative number, if x

146
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,060
plus 3 is going to be a negative
number-- that's what

147
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,010
we're assuming here-- if it's
going to be a negative number,

148
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,090
then when you take the absolute
value of a negative

149
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,050
number, you're going to
make it positive.

150
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,280
That's just like multiplying
it by negative 1.

151
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,870
If you know you're taking the
absolute value of a negative

152
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,890
number, it's just like
multiplying it by negative 1,

153
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,010
because you're going to
make it positive.

154
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,870
And this is going to
be the situation.

155
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,840
x plus 3 is less than 0.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,850
If we subtract 3 from both
sides, when x is less than

157
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,280
negative 3.

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,920
So when x is less than negative
3, the graph will

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
look like this.

160
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,280
When x is greater than negative
3, the graph will

161
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,600
look like that.

162
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,300
So let's see what that
would make the

163
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,670
entire graph look like.

164
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:21,520
Let me draw my axes.

165
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,070
That's my x-axis, that's
my y-axis.

166
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,090
So just let me multiply this
out, just so we have it in mx

167
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,870
plus b form.

168
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,070
So this is equal to negative
x minus 3.

169
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,409
So let's just figure out
what this graph would

170
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,620
look like in general.

171
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,020
Negative x minus 3.

172
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,380
The y-intercept is negative
3, so 1, 2, 3.

173
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,060
And negative x means it
slopes downward, has a

174
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,290
downward slope of 1.

175
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,540
So it would look like this.

176
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,830
The x-intercept would be
at x is equal to--.

177
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,740
So if you say y is equal to 0,
that would happen when x is

178
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,575
equal to negative 3.

179
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,380
So it's going to go
through that line,

180
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,920
that point right there.

181
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,190
And the graph, if we didn't
have this constraint right

182
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,600
here, would look something
like this.

183
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,760
That's if we didn't constrain
it to a certain interval on

184
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
the x-axis.

185
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,080
Now this graph, what
does it look like?

186
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,480
Let's see.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,810
It has its y-intercept
at positive 3.

188
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,230
Just like that.

189
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,260
And where's its x-intecept?

190
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,970
When y is equal to 0,
x is negative 3.

191
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,760
So it also goes through that
point right there, and it has

192
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,620
a slope of 1.

193
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,710
So it would look something
like this.

194
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,330
That's what this graph
looks like.

195
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,100
Now, what we figured out is
that this absolute value

196
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,030
function, it looks like this
purple graph when x is less

197
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,830
than negative 3.

198
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,070
So when x is less than negative
3-- that's x is equal

199
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,593
to negative 3 right there-- when
x is less than negative

200
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:03,170
3, it looks like this
purple graph.

201
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,570
Right there.

202
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,390
So that's when x is less
than negative 3.

203
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,830
But when x is greater than
negative 3, it looks like the

204
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,160
green graph.

205
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
It looks like that.

206
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,480
So this graph looks like
this strange v.

207
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,430
When x is greater than negative
3, this is positive.

208
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,950
So we have the graph of-- we
have a positive slope.

209
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,270
But then when x is less than
negative 3, we're essentially

210
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,550
taking the negative of the
function, if you want to view

211
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,280
it that way, and so we have
this negative slope.

212
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,060
So you kind of have this
v-shaped function, this

213
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,250
v-shaped graph, which is
indicative of an absolute

214
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,950
value function.
