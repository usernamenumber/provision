1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,190
Write an inequality that fits
the graph shown below.

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,520
So here they've graphed a line
in red, and the inequality

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,280
includes this line because
it's in bold red.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,380
It's not a dashed line.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,720
It's going to be all of
the area above it.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,600
So it's all the area y is going
to be greater than or

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,530
equal to this line.

9
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,630
So first we just have
to figure out the

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,680
equation of this line.

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,360
We can figure out its
y-intercept just

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,470
by looking at it.

13
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,470
Its y-intercept is
right there.

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,480
Let me do that in
a darker color.

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,880
Its y-intercept is right there
at y is equal to negative 2.

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,530
That's the point
0, negative 2.

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,550
So if you think about this line,
if you think about its

18
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,440
equation as being of the form
y is equal to mx plus b in

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
slope-intercept form, we figured
out b is equal to

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,050
negative 2.

21
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,560
So that is negative
2 right there.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,430
And let's think about
its slope.

23
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:58,530
If we move 2 in the x-direction,
if delta x is

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,960
equal to 2, if our change in x
is positive 2, what is our

25
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,990
change in y?

26
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,850
Our change in y is equal
to negative 1.

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:16,560
Slope, or this m, is equal to
change in y over change in x,

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
which is equal to, in this case,
negative 1 over 2, or

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,670
negative 1/2.

30
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,360
And just to reinforce, you could
have done this anywhere.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,800
You could have said, hey, what
happens if I go back 4 in x?

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:34,450
So if I went back 4, if delta
x was negative 4, if delta x

33
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,330
is equal to negative
4, then delta y is

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,580
equal to positive 2.

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,300
   

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:49,020
And once again, delta y over
delta x would be positive 2

37
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,700
over negative 4, which
is also negative 1/2.

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,620
I just want to reinforce that
it's not dependent on how far

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,370
I move along in x or whether
I go forward or backward.

40
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,840
You're always going to get or
you should always get, the

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,660
same slope.

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,030
It's negative 1/2.

43
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,150
So the equation of that line
is y is equal to the slope,

44
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,050
negative 1/2x, plus the
y-intercept, minus 2.

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,530
That's the equation of this
line right there.

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,940
Now, this inequality includes
that line and everything above

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,490
it for any x value.

48
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,950
Let's say x is equal to 1.

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,750
This line will tell us-- well,
let's take this point so we

50
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,770
get to an integer.

51
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,360
Let's say that x
is equal to 2.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,590
Let me get rid of that 1.

53
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,190
When x is equal to 2, this
value is going to give us

54
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,535
negative 1/2 times 2, which is
negative 1, minus 2, is going

55
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:41,550
to give us negative 3.

56
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,620
But this inequality isn't just
y is equal to negative 3.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,290
y would be negative 3 or all
of the values greater than

58
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,900
negative 3.

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,500
I know that, because
they shaded in this

60
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,180
whole area up here.

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,920
So the equation, or, as I should
say, the inequality

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,370
that fits the graph here below
is-- and I'll do it in a bold

63
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,970
color-- is y is greater
than or equal to

64
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,680
negative 1/2x minus 2.

65
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,600
That is the inequality that is
depicted in this graph, where

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,180
this is just the line, but we
want all of the area above and

67
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,220
equal to the line.

68
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,600
So that's what we have
for the inequality.

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,733
