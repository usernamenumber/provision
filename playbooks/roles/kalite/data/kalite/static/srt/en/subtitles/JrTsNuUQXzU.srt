00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:09,390
We are in the Palazzo Barberini

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,762
looking at a painting by Caravaggio,

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:16,267
called Narcissus at the Source. This is the title.

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,334
And this is the story from Ovid of a boy

5
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:23,174
who falls in love with his own reflection in the water

6
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:26,703
so much that he falls in and drowns.

7
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:38,631
Of course there is a flower named after him as is the word Narcissism.

8
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:43,488
In a Christian context it is a morality tale, a caution, about

9
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:48,346
what is important and what is not important. But it is an extraordinarily interesting subject for a painter,

10
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:48,846
That's true, especially because you get the reality of the figure and the reflection. Of course paintings

11
00:00:48,846 --> 00:01:00,983
themselves are sort of mirrors or reflections . They certainly are and the idea of the artist's responsibility in terms of depiction,

12
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,101
in terms of creating a faithfulness

13
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:11,100
and the dangers that are inherent in that. It is interesting if you look at this painting, in the reflection, within the

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:19,449
painting,is a dimmer image, much dimmer,and it is really only the highlights that come forward. The painting

15
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:22,516
is also incredibly abstract. The surface of the water,

16
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:31,368
the edge of the water is almost dividing the canvas almost exactly in half, not quite, but close, creating this continuity between

17
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:39,376
the hands that are touching and the arms, and the circular form inscribed within the rectangle of the canvas.

18
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:48,461
It seems to me that it could be a kind of metaphor for a kind of meditation on painting and its goals and its dangers , as

19
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:57,832
the painter had to think about how he was painting the so-called reality, the real figure versus the reflection

20
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:05,680
of the real figure and painting itself is a reflection itself. The other thing is the foreshortening of the

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:16,979
figure itself leans out toward us with a kind of longing. All of those very Baroque elements of really moving into

22
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:25,283
the space of the viewer are here and that tenebrosso , the dark background really makes us focus on the figure that fills

23
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:33,950
the shape of the canvas. The thing that is really vivid is the knee and also the shirt sleeve. Often the thing that

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:51,264
draws our attention is not to the thing that you think in realism

25
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:51,764
Whereas in reality the thing that you might look at or have the thing that light falls on is not necessarily the most

26
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:54,851
important thing in the room. I want to look at his left hand on the right side of the canvas. Lets take

27
00:02:54,851 --> 00:03:00,007
a close look. What seems to be happening is his right hand on the left side seems to be firmly planted on

28
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:07,048
the ground. He seems to be so absentminded, so taken with his own image thet he seems that he's about to support himself

29
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:11,726
where he can't on the water's edge. He looks as if he is about to fall in, and this might be that moment.

30
00:03:12,930 --> 99:59:59,999
He is almost reaching in to embrace himself. He is falling in love with himself, literally. But he will embrace only his refelection, which is of course, intangible.
