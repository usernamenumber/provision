1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:02,763
Let’s verify that the margin mechanics

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:05,904
and the marking to market of the futures contract

3
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:08,772
actually gets both the seller and the buyer

4
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:10,242
what they originally wanted,

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,703
which is that they don't have to be susceptible

6
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:15,703
to the volatility in apple prices.

7
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:18,897
They both wanted to, effectively,

8
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,917
sell the apples for 20 cents a pound,

9
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,424
or buy the apples for 20 cents a pound.

10
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,385
And they didn't want to,

11
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,311
in the farmers case, go out of business

12
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,190
if they could only sell the apples for 10 cents a pound –

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,477
or in the pie company’s case, go out of business

14
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:33,800
if they have to buy the apples for 30 cents a pound.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,265
So let’s verify that this works out.

16
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,075
So they originally had a contract price

17
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:39,744
of $200 dollars for 1000 pounds.

18
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:42,297
So this is essentially 20 cents a pound.

19
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:43,643
20 cents a pound.

20
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,755
And as we said in the previous video,

21
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,333
as the futures contract delivery price,

22
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,602
changes day by day –

23
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:51,583
as we get closer and closer

24
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,864
to the actual delivery date,

25
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:55,984
what happens is that we transfer money

26
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:57,699
between the buyer’s margin account

27
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,260
and the seller’s margin account.

28
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,652
As the price of –

29
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:03,409
As the delivery price in the futures contract goes down,

30
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,708
in order to mark the delivery prices down –

31
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:07,638
so, in order to mark it down

32
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:11,211
from $200 to $190 dollars to $185 dollars –

33
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,741
This guy keeps getting a better deal

34
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,117
on the actual delivery price,

35
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:15,847
so to make things fair,

36
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:18,097
he has to transfer the same amount of money

37
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,609
to the margin account of the seller.

38
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,718
So let’s imagine two scenarios.

39
00:01:22,718 --> 00:01:24,218
Let's say that eventually –

40
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:26,284
as we approach November 15th –

41
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,137
(Remember this is the delivery date.)

42
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:30,608
– the future's contract delivery price

43
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,108
is going to approach the market price.

44
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:33,531
You can imagine, right when we're like

45
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,061
a second before the delivery date

46
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,888
the futures contract and the market price

47
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,218
aren’t going to be that different.

48
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:43,731
Let's say that this goes all the way down to $100 dollars.

49
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,307
So in that whole process, this futures contract

50
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,422
keeps getting marked down to $100 dollars.

51
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:51,502
So on that day, it is true

52
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:54,773
that the seller will sell $1000 pounds of apples

53
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,031
to the buyer for only $100.

54
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,113
You might say, “Hey wait. What'd the seller get out of this?

55
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:03,254
He’s only getting 10 cents per pound for his apples.

56
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:04,554
This was what he feared!

57
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:07,120
He is susceptible to the volatility of the market prices.”

58
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,375
But remember, because of this marking to market,

59
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,750
and because of the margin transfers here,

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,657
as this delivery price went down

61
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:16,846
from $200 dollars to $100 dollars,

62
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,061
there would have been a transfer –

63
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,038
from this guy's margin account

64
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:22,509
to this guy's margin account –

65
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,837
of 100 dollars.

66
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:27,550
So instead of just getting the $100 dollars

67
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,045
for that thousand pounds of apples,

68
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,966
because this seller had this futures contract,

69
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,374
he would have also gotten

70
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:36,172
another $100 transferred into his margin account.

71
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:41,301
So, the true economic value he gets is $200 dollars –

72
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,499
no matter what –

73
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:44,168
for his 1000 pounds of apples –

74
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,632
or 20 cents a pound.

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,456
You can imagine the other scenario.

76
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,026
What if the delivery price –

77
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:51,207
as we get closer and closer to delivery date –

78
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,499
goes up?

79
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,787
– if it goes to $300?

80
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:57,478
– $300 per 1000 pounds?

81
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,452
Well, you might say, “Hey!

82
00:02:58,452 --> 00:03:00,043
The seller’s going to get a bonanza.

83
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:01,026
And this guy's going to go out of business –

84
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,027
because he's going to be

85
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:04,828
essentially paying 30 cents a pound!”

86
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,089
But you’ve got to remember.

87
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:09,165
If the price goes up, and it becomes

88
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,465
more and more favorable to the seller –

89
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,098
because of the margin mechanics,

90
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:14,385
the seller would have to transfer $100

91
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:17,707
as the price moves up –

92
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:19,831
to the buyer –

93
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,021
to his margin account.

94
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:22,209
And so, even though this guy

95
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:24,467
has to pay $300 dollars per [1000 pounds] –

96
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:25,361
because that's where the market price

97
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,650
eventually ended up –

98
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,763
he would get $100 dollars from the seller.

99
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:33,028
So, effectively, he would still only have to pay $200 dollars.

100
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,247
And even though this guy’s selling it for $300,

101
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,497
he actually had to pay another $100 dollars.

102
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,995
So net, he's really only getting $200 for it.

103
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,076
So no matter how you look at it,

104
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:44,999
both parties are transacting at $200 dollars,

105
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,658
or 20 cents a pound.
