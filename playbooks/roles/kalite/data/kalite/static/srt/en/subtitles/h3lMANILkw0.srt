1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's go over that example, that I gave in the last video,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,170
where I'm in this village and I start a bank to match up

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,700
savers with investment opportunities.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,130
And I actually want to do it, one, to hit the point home

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,360
a little bit more about how a bank makes money.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,860
And I actually think this example is a very good instrument

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,040
to teach you about a new financial statement that

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,480
I don't think I've covered at all much.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,890
And that's the income statement.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,490
So far, you're familiar with the balance sheets, hopefully.

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,410
And now, we'll learn what an income statement is.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,680
So let's say that this is my balance sheet at the beginning

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,640
of my first year of operation, the beginning of year one.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,280
And let me see if I can recreate it.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,930
I think I had said that I had originally capitalized

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,520
this company with $1 million.

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,180
That was coming from my savings.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,520
Or maybe I went to 10 of my friends

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,300
and they gave me $100,000 each.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,480
But we don't care about how that equity was raised.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,230
All we know is that we had $1 million.

22
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,319
And then, I had bought a building that

23
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,510
I could put money in, that looks really safe.

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,830
And people would feel secure giving that money,

25
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,200
putting that money into that building.

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,037
So let's say I had $1 million of real estate.

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,977
And then, the rest of the village saw

28
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:13,070
this nice big fortress I had constructed.

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,790
And so they gave me at least part of

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,700
their savings as deposits.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,320
Saying that, wow, that's a safer place to put my money

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,270
than in my mattress or buried in my backyard.

33
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,528
And, this bank of Sal says that

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,062
he's going to give me some interest.

35
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:31,020
And he seems to be a fairly reputable fellow in our village.

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,920
So let's deposit some of our savings with him.

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,038
So I get $10 million of deposits.

38
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,530
And, of course, I told them, look, this isn't a loan.

39
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,810
Although, it kind of is.

40
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,470
I'm not borrowing this money from you.

41
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,960
You guys can use this money whenever you need it.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,650
And because of that, I need to set some of these deposits aside,

43
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,100
in case someone comes the next day and says,

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,455
I gave you that dollar yesterday.

45
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:57,518
I actually need that dollar now

46
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:01,060
to pay for my teeth cleaning or something.

47
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,360
So I need to set aside some of it.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,010
And I figure, well, if I set aside 10% of it,

49
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,970
that's the most that anyone would ever come in one day,

50
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,070
unless there's some type of strange run on the bank.

51
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,790
So I'm going to set aside 10% of it as reserves.

52
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,030
So it's cash reserves.

53
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:24,563
So let's say, $1 million of cash.

54
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,850
If I thought, for some reason, that there's a higher likelihood

55
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,360
of everyone coming at once for their money,

56
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,760
or a large percentage of the people coming at once,

57
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,660
I'd want larger reserves.

58
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,810
And then, finally, I'm left with $9 million.

59
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,310
They gave me 10, I had to put one aside.

60
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,490
I'm left with $9 million to loan out.

61
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,520
This is productive capital.

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,580
And when I say, capital, that's just a claim on someone's goods

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,810
and services that can be used to construct

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,950
or perform something that adds value,

65
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,290
that creates more value than was used.

66
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,130
So that's $9 million of loans.

67
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,700
And I know I always keep talking in those terms.

68
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,270
And I do that because I think, in our society today,

69
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,210
we get so fixated with the points, and that's money, or the dollar bills,

70
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,570
that we often forget what the points represent.

71
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,350
The points, or the money,

72
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,410
represents claims on goods and services.

73
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,670
I've actually met people who become obsessed with--

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,900
Well actually, like on Khan!

75
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,894
I get emails from people

76
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:27,710
who want to get extra points on their account.

77
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,510
And they're obsessed with it.

78
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,730
And it's just a number.

79
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,820
But what's important is,

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,890
what does a point system really do for you?

81
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,840
And in money, those points represent

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
future claims on goods and services.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,990
So this is how my balance sheet looked

84
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,390
at the beginning of year one.

85
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,980
And I said, well, I'm going to be

86
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,230
getting in 10% on these loans.

87
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,320
And let's say that I'm very good
and none of them default.

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,870
And I really do get my 10%.

89
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,140
And I said that I'm going to
pay these people out 5%.

90
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,230
So what happens over the
course of that year?

91
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,486
So how much interest income
am I going to get?

92
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,090
I'll call that interest, Int
Inc. So 9 million times 10%.

93
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,399
I'm going to get $900,000.

94
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,360
And then, what's my
interest expense?

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
I probably should have
done this in green.

96
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,950
Well, I have to pay out
5% on the $10 million.

97
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,690
So it's $500,000.

98
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll put it as a negative
number, just so you know it's

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,300
an expense.

100
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,048
Although, since I said it's an
expense, you might want to put

101
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:43,620
it as a positive number.

102
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,900
But that's just an accounting
convention.

103
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,540
But I think you get the idea.

104
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,770
Let me put it as
minus $500,000.

105
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,190
And then to operate this bank--
I had this building. it

106
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,610
had to be cleaned.

107
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,990
It has to be maintained.

108
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,720
I had to hire bank tellers
and security guards.

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,140
And I had to buy my security
guards machine guns.

110
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,890
I have expenses, above and
beyond just this little

111
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,100
interest transaction
that's going on.

112
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,590
So let's say that
I have salaries.

113
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,840
So I have some other expenses.

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,950
Let's say it's minus 50K
a year in salaries

115
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,100
that I have to pay.

116
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,750
And let's say, upkeep of the
building-- you have to paint

117
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,000
it every now and then.

118
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,280
Have to install new marble
tiles every now and then.

119
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,470
Because I have to project this
impression of the shining,

120
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,885
impenetrable fortress.

121
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:44,090
So upkeep is actually a
big expense for me.

122
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,350
So I spend 50K on upkeep.

123
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,540
And so, what am I left with?

124
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,220
Let's see, 900 minus 500 is
400, minus another 100.

125
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,760
So I'm left with 300,000.

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,120
But even though this is a
primitive village that I live

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,220
in, it's not so primitive that
it does not have taxes.

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,540
And so, this is my
pre-tax income.

129
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,340
[PHONE RINGS]

130
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,636
My cellphone is ringing,
but I'll ignore it.

131
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:13,460
Actually, it's very
hard to ignore.

132
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,460
But anyway, this is
my pre-tax income.

133
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,720
But my local village government
says, well, you

134
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,800
have to pay for the army and all
of the other services that

135
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,850
we provide.

136
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,100
So they take 30%.

137
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,350
So income taxes.

138
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,585
Let's say they take one third.

139
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:37,530
So they take 100K.

140
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,480
And so, what am I going
to be left with?

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,670
What is my net income?

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,910
300 minus 100, I'm
left with 200K.

143
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,190
Fair enough.

144
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,720
And, just so you know, this
is the income statement.

145
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,450
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about how all

146
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,380
of these match up.

147
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,940
So let me let me draw big,
nice box around it.

148
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,920
So it looks like a proper
statement of something.

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,620
So what is my balance sheet
going to look like at the end

150
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,720
of the year, given that this
is how much money I made?

151
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,040
Well, let's say those loans
haven't been paid off, just

152
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,760
people paid the 10%
interest on them.

153
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,230
So I still have those loans
on my balance sheet.

154
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,210
Let me draw the loans.

155
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,830
So I still have $9 million of
assets, which are those loans.

156
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,180
They haven't paid them off.

157
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,280
I still have the building.

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,220
And actually since I spent
50,000 on upkeep, all of the

159
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,450
wear and tear was made up
for, with my upkeep.

160
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,600
So it's still worth
a million dollars.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,650
So I still have a million dollar
building, 9 million of

162
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,980
loans outstanding.

163
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I had a million dollars
of cash.

164
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,410
And now, how much
cash do I have?

165
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,440
Well, I had that million
dollars before.

166
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,610
And I'm assuming that my overall
level of deposits do

167
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,870
not change over the course
of the year.

168
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,240
So I had a million dollars of
cash, and nothing dramatic

169
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,590
happens with the deposits.

170
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,180
Over the course of the
year, I show right

171
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,600
here, I made $200,000.

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,930
And this 200,000 is,
essentially,

173
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,340
going to be cash now.

174
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,495
So now, I have 1.2
million of cash.

175
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,860
My deposits haven't changed.

176
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,375
I still have 10 million
of deposits.

177
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,140
Those are liabilities, because
I owe them to the people

178
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,830
who've deposited their
money with me.

179
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,810
I owe them money.

180
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,890
And so what am I left with?

181
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,800
What is my equity?

182
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,030
My equity was 1 million.

183
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,549
What is my equity now?

184
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,870
Well, equity is just total
assets minus total liability.

185
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,200
So what are my total
assets now?

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,669
9 plus 1 is 10, plus 1.2.

187
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,830
I have 11.2 million
of total assets.

188
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,370
Minus my total liabilities,
minus 10.

189
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,880
So I have 1.2 million,
now, of equity.

190
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,220
Now, something interesting
has happened.

191
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,000
What has been my change
in equity?

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,900
I had $1 million of equity.

193
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,640
Now I have $1.2 million
of equity.

194
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,370
So my change in equity-- so $1
million to $1.2 million.

195
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,400
So we could call it, if you're
used to the math notation, you

196
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,820
could use that delta notation.

197
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,520
Triangle just means change.

198
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,390
My change in equity is
equal to $200,000.

199
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,630
And that is the same thing
as your net income.

200
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,610
So what is an income
statement?

201
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,510
Well, first of all, this
is an income statement.

202
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,740
But how does it connect with
the balance sheet?

203
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,940
And later, we'll talk about
the cash flow statement.

204
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,910
Well, a balance sheet is just
a snapshot of what you have

205
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,180
and what you owe at any
given point in time.

206
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,430
This is the balance sheet at
the beginning of the year.

207
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,870
This is the balance sheet
at the end of the year.

208
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,970
This is a snapshot of what
you have and what

209
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,250
you owe at the beginning.

210
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,470
This is a snapshot of what you
have and what you owe at the

211
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,470
end of the year.

212
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,560
The income statement tells you
what happened over the course

213
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,520
of this year.

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,590
So it essentially tells you
how did you get from this

215
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,970
balance sheet to this
balance sheet.

216
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,932
Another way to think about it,
the income statement, at the

217
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:14,160
end, it'll tell you all
of your inputs.

218
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,350
What money came in.

219
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,710
What money came out in
the form of expenses

220
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,040
and taxes, et cetera.

221
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,020
And then, you get a
net income number.

222
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,680
And that net income number is
actually the change in equity.

223
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,040
So if you have a positive net
income in a year, the balance

224
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,430
sheet's equity will increase
by that amount in a year.

225
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,850
And if you have a negative net
income, your balance sheet's

226
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,560
equity will decrease
in a year.

227
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
So you could actually call your
net income is the same

228
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,530
thing as your change
in equity.

229
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,410
And, another thing you want
to talk about, what's

230
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,260
your return on equity?

231
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,590
Well, your initial equity
was $1 million.

232
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,390
How much money did we make?

233
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,110
Well, it grew by $200,000.

234
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,500
So 200,000 over 1 million.

235
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,140
Well, we could call that
1,000 thousands.

236
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,950
That equals a 20%.

237
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,520
That was our return on equity.

238
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,310
We put in a million, and we
got 20% more than that.

239
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,420
That was our return on equity.

240
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,830
Equals ROE.

241
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:19,240
And notice, the return on equity
is really-- that's the

242
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
same thing.

243
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,620
That's change of equity divided
by starting equity,

244
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,945
which is the same thing as
net income in the period.

245
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,470
Well, I'm defining it
as starting equity.

246
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,510
Sometimes people talk
about it as average

247
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,360
equity, and all of that.

248
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,230
Anyway, I thought that this was
a good tool to at least

249
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,380
introduce you to the notion of
an income statement, and show

250
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,240
you how to all connects.

251
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,590
Because that's the beauty
of accounting.

252
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,280
It's that you have these
different financial statements

253
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,500
that are very intertwined
with each other.

254
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,880
You give me two balance
sheets.

255
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,150
And then, I can actually
construct the income statement

256
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,160
that must have happened
in between them.

257
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,480
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
