1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,330
   

2
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,890
In the last video, I spoke
somewhat theoretically about

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,690
what a null space is
and we showed that

4
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,700
it is a valid subspace.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,960
But in this video let's actually
calculate the null

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,380
space for a matrix.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,220
In this case, we'll calculate
the null space of matrix A.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,420
So null space is literally
just the set of all the

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,230
vectors that, when I multiply A
times any of those vectors,

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:29,560
so let me say that the vector
x1, x2, x3, x4 is a member of

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,850
our null space.

12
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,410
So when I multiply this matrix
times this vector I should get

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,920
the 0 vector.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,430
I should get the vector.

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,450
And just to make a few
points here, this

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,850
has exactly 4 columns.

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,120
This is a 3 by 4 matrix, so I've
only legitimately defined

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,310
multiplication of this times a
four-component vector or a

19
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,050
member of Rn.

20
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,970
Let me call this X.

21
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,440
And this is our vector X.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,700
This is a member of R4.

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,260
It has four components.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,040
And then when you multiply
these, we need

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
to produce a 0 vector.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,090
The null space is the set of
all the vectors, and when I

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,350
multiply it times A, I
produce the 0 vector.

28
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,060
And what am I going to get?

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,570
I'm going to have one row times
this and that's going to

30
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,830
be the first entry, then this
row times, that's the second

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,780
entry, and then the third row.

32
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,580
So I should have three 0's So my
0 vector is going to be the

33
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,070
0 vector in R3.

34
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,730
So how do we figure out the set
of all of these x's that

35
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,580
satisfy this?

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,370
Let me just write our
formal notation.

37
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:38,260
The null space of A is the set
of all vectors that are a

38
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,340
member of -- we generally say
Rn, but this is a 3 by 4

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,720
matrix, so these are all the
vectors that are going to be

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,730
members of R4, because I'm using
this particular A, such

41
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,910
that my matrix A times any
of these vectors is

42
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,530
equal to the 0 vector.

43
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,400
In this case it's going
to be 0 vector in R3.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,420
So how do we do this?

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,680
Well, this is just a straight
up linear equation.

46
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,100
We can write it that way.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,860
If we were to actually perform
the matrix multiplication, we

48
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,830
get 1 times x1.

49
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,010
Let me write it here.

50
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,800
Let me do it in a
different color.

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,920
1 times x1, plus 1 times x2,
plus 1 times x3, plus 1 times

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,460
x4 is equal to this 0 there.

53
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,580
So that times that is
equal to that 0.

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,500
And then this times this should
be equal to that 0.

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:41,430
So 1 times x1, so you get x1,
plus 2 times x2, plus 3 times

56
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,710
x3, plus 4 times x4 is going
to be equal to that 0.

57
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,510
And then finally we have that
times this vector should be

58
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,990
equal to that 0.

59
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:58,770
So the dot product of this row
vector with this column vector

60
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,220
should be equal to that 0.

61
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,690
So you get 4x1.

62
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:21,690
4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x1 plus 2x3
plus x4 is equal to 0.

63
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,570
4x1 plus 3x2 plus 2x3 plus
x4 is equal to 0.

64
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,230
You just have to find the
solution set to this and we'll

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,220
essentially have figured
out our null space.

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,920
Now, we've figured out the
solution set to systems of

67
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,770
equations like this.

68
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,090
We have three equations
with four unknowns.

69
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,650
We can do that.

70
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,610
We can represent this by an
augmented matrix and then put

71
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,370
that in reduced row
echelon form.

72
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,080
Let's do that.

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,865
I can represent this problem
as the augmented matrix.

74
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:54,750
   

75
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,260
1, 1, 4.

76
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,070
1, 2, 3.

77
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,550
1, 3, 2.

78
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,110
and then 1, 4, 1.

79
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,495
And then I augment that
with the 0 vector.

80
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,720
And the immediate thing you
should notice is we took the

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,610
pain of multiplying this times
this to equal that, and we

82
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,600
wrote this as a system of
equations, but now we want to

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,980
solve the system of equations,
we're going back to the

84
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,050
augmented matrix world.

85
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,290
What does this augmented
matrix look like?

86
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,010
Well, this is just our
matrix A right there.

87
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,570
That's just matrix A right
there, that's just the 0

88
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,880
vector right there.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,980
And to solve this, and we've
done this before, we're just

90
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,640
going to put this augmented
matrix into row echelon form.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,450
What you're going to find is
when you put it into row

92
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,230
echelon form, this right side's
not going to change at

93
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,680
all, because no matter what you
multiply or subtract by,

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,930
you're just doing it all times
0, so you just keep

95
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,870
ending up with 0.

96
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,880
So as we put this into reduced
row echelon form, were

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
actually just putting matrix A
into reduced echelon form.

98
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,110
So let me do that, instead
of just talking about it.

99
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,620
So let me start off by keeping
row 1 the same.

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,570
Row 1 is 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,630
And then I want to eliminate
this 1 right here, so let me

102
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,820
replace row 2 with row
2 minus row 1.

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,980
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

104
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,050
2 minus 1 is 1.

105
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,170
3 minus 1 is 2.

106
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,400
4 minus 1 is 3.

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,970
0 minus 0 is 0.

108
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,490
You can see the 0's aren't
going to change.

109
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,740
And then let me replace this
guy with 4 times this guy,

110
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,480
minus this guy.

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,940
So I can only get rid of this.

112
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,610
So 4 times 1 minus 4 is 0.

113
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,950
4 times 1 minus 3 is 1.

114
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,920
4 times 1 minus 2 is 2.

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,840
4 times 1 minus 1 is 3.

116
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,750
4 times 0 minus 0 is 0.

117
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,490
Now I want to get rid of, if I
want to put this in reduced

118
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,170
row echelon form, I want
to get rid of that

119
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,660
term and that term.

120
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,920
So let me keep my middle
row the same.

121
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,135
My middle row is 0, 1, 2, 3.

122
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:16,380
   

123
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,330
So that's 0 on the augmented
side of it, although these 0's

124
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,470
are never going to change, it's
really just a little bit

125
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,780
of an exercise just to
keep writing them.

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,140
And my first row, let me replace
it with the first row

127
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,360
minus the second row, so I
can get rid of this 1.

128
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,720
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

129
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,410
1 minus 1 is 0.

130
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,140
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

131
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,340
1 minus 3 is minus 2.

132
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,390
And 0 minus 0 is 0.

133
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,670
And let me replace this last
row with the last row minus

134
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,610
the middle row.

135
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,890
So 0 minus 0 is 0.

136
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,440
1 minus 1 is 0.

137
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,570
2 minus 2 is 0.

138
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,770
I think you see where
this is going.

139
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,510
3 minus 3 is 0.

140
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,790
And obviously 0 minus 0 is 0.

141
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,510
So this system of equations
has been reduced, just by

142
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,560
doing reduce row echelon
form, this problem.

143
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,030
If I just rewrite this right
here, this can be written as a

144
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:21,870
system equations of x1 minus
x3 minus x4, right?

145
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,110
The 0 x2's is equal to 0.

146
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,830
And then this second row right
here, there's no x1, you just

147
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:37,870
have an x2, plus 2x3, plus 3x2
is equal to 0, and this

148
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,420
obviously gives me no
information whatsoever.

149
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,510
And so I can solve this.

150
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,160
I can solve this for x1 and
x2, and what do I get?

151
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,960
I get x1 is equal
to x3 plus x4.

152
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,170
Actually, I made
a mistake here.

153
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:01,000
This is x1 minus x3 minus 2
times x4 is equal to 0.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So if I rewrite this, I get x1
is equal to x3 plus 2x4.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,720
   

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,290
And then I get x2.

157
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,280
Let me do that in green.

158
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:20,875
x2 is equal to minus
2 x3 minus 3x2.

159
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,090
   

160
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,270
So if I wanted to write the
solution set to this equation,

161
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,640
if I wanted to write it in terms
of this, I could write

162
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,260
x1, x2, x3, x4 is equal to
-- what's x1 equal to?

163
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:54,400
It's equal to x3 times
1 plus x4 times 2.

164
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,720
Right?

165
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,500
I just got this right here from
this equation right here.

166
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,600
x1 is equal to 1 times
x3, plus 2 times x4.

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,320
That's just that, right there.

168
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,145
Now, x2 is equal to x3
times minus 2, plus

169
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:13,330
x4 times minus 3.

170
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,410
What am I doing?

171
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,050
I'm losing track of things.

172
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:22,800
This x2 right here is x2 plus
2x3 plus 3x4 is equal to 0.

173
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,620
So x2 is equal to minus
2x3, minus 3x4.

174
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,060
Right.

175
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,280
Like that.

176
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,900
Sorry, my brain isn't completely
in the problem, I'm

177
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,730
making these silly mistakes.

178
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,270
But I think you understand
this now.

179
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,990
So then what is x3 equal to?

180
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,840
Well, it's just equal
to 1 times x3,

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,580
plus 0 times x4, right?

182
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,800
x3 is equal to x3.

183
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,770
And what's x4 equal to?

184
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,420
It's equal to 0 times
x3 plus 1 times x4.

185
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,220
So all of the vectors in R4,
these are a member R4, which

186
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,840
satisfy the equation, our
original equation, ax is equal

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,210
to 0, can be represented as a
linear combination of these

188
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,980
two vectors, of those
two vectors, right?

189
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,020
These are just random scalars
that are a member of-- We can

190
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,210
pick any real number for x3
and we could pick any real

191
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,810
number for x4.

192
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,140
So our solution set is just a
linear combination of those

193
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,200
two vectors.

194
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,060
What's another way of
saying a linear

195
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,130
combination of two vectors?

196
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,470
Let me write this.

197
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,530
The null space of A, which is
just a solution set of this

198
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,600
equation, it's just all the
x's that satisfy this

199
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,090
equation, it equals all of the
linear combinations of this

200
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,530
vector and that vector.

201
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,780
What do we call all the linear
combinations of two vectors?

202
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,330
It's the span of those
two vectors.

203
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,000
So it equals the span of that
vector and that vector.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,290
Of the vector 1, minus 2,
1, 0, and the vector

205
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,840
2, minus 3, 0, 1.

206
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,490
And this is our null space.

207
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,050
Before letting you go, let me
just point out one interesting

208
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,640
thing right here.

209
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,950
We represented our system of
equation like this and we put

210
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,130
it into reduced row echelon
form, so this is

211
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,700
A and this is 0.

212
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,840
This right here is, let me make
sure I have some space,

213
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,600
let me put it right here.

214
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,970
That right there is the reduced
row echelon form of A.

215
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,180
And so where essentially this
equation, this is a linear

216
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,170
equation that is trying
to solve this problem.

217
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,050
The reduced row echelon form
of A times our vector x is

218
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,530
equal to 0.

219
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,580
So, all the solutions to this
are also the solutions to our

220
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,290
original problem, to our
original ax is equal to 0.

221
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,530
So what's the solution
to this?

222
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,320
All the x's that satisfy this,
these are the null space of

223
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,470
the reduced row echelon
form of A.

224
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,110
Right?

225
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,570
So here are all of the x's, this
is the null space, this

226
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,180
problem, if we find all of the
x's here, this is the null

227
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,315
space of the reduced row echelon
form of our matrix A.

228
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:10,030
But we're saying that this
problem is the same problem as

229
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,790
this one, right?

230
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,800
So we can write that the null
space of A is equal to the

231
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,350
null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A.

232
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,000
And that might seem a little
bit confusing, hey, why are

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,430
you even writing this out, but
it's the actually very useful

234
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,860
when you're trying to calculate
null spaces.

235
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,240
So we didn't even have
to write a big

236
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,180
augmented matrix here.

237
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,750
We can say, take our matrix A,
put it in reduced row echelon

238
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,780
form and then figure out
it's null space.

239
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,060
We would have gone straight
to this point right here.

240
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,170
This is the reduced row echelon
form of A, and then I

241
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,950
could have immediately solved
these equations, right?

242
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,040
I would have just taken the dot
product of the reduced row

243
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,840
echelon form or, not the dot
product, the matrix vector

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,350
product of the reduced row
echelon form of A with this

245
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,800
vector, and I would've gotten
these equations, and then

246
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,150
these equations would
immediately, I can just

247
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,060
rewrite them in this
form, and I would

248
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,890
have gotten our result.

249
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,180
But anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably useful.
