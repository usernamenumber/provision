1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
   

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,970
In the second Geithner video,
I lay out a scenario where a

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,400
bank could-- let me draw
its balance sheet.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,840
Let's say-- oh, that's not
how I wanted to do it.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,170
Let's say this is a bank.

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,476
It's holding-- let me draw its
assets and liabilities.

7
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:23,790
So it's holding some toxic
asset A right here.

8
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,210
And that could be the bank's
equity, that's its

9
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,700
liabilities, And this is the
other assets for the bank.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,270
So it could hold some toxic
asset A, and we lay out a

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,640
scenario where, what the bank
could do, right now it has

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,380
100% exposure to A.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,310
What it could do is it could
take a little bit of cash,

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,530
lend it to another party.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,635
Let's say it could lend it to a
hedge fund, so this becomes

16
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,310
a loan to the hedge fund.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:54,190
So now the hedge fund owes this
money to our bank and it

18
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,430
now has the cash on
its balance sheet.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,620
So this would now, instead of
being cash, it'll be called

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,470
loan to hedge fund.

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,670
Now this is the hedge fund's
balance sheet.

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,380
Its liability is
loan from bank.

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,740
And now it has this cash, and
then it could use this cash to

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,540
invest in essentially the Legacy
Loans Program, the

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,560
public-private investor Legacy
Loans Program that Geithner

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,480
talks about.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,070
And if they did this, they could
take this-- let's say

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,900
this was $7.

29
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,400
They could take this $7,
contribute it to the equity in

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,420
the program.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,210
The Treasury would contribute
another $7.

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,205
The Fed would contribute $84,
and then they would have $100,

33
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,150
and I know this is kind of
messy, but they would have

34
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,600
$100 that they can then use
to go buy these assets.

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,810
And the net effect of this is
that this bank went from

36
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,570
having 100% exposure to this
toxic asset to having only $7

37
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,880
exposure through this loan to
this hedge fund, or this

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,770
special-purpose entity, or
whatever you want to call it.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,820
And I got a couple of emails,
even from some colleagues, to

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,340
say, well, can this
really be done?

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,420
And my kind of knee-jerk
reaction was, well, if this

42
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,930
can't be done, they'll figure
out a way to do it, because

43
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,500
there's billions of dollars
at stake, and really, the

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,320
incentive here is structured
to do it.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,860
And frankly, the Government
probably wants them to do it,

46
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,300
because on some level, even
though this would be a massive

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,280
transfer of exposure and wealth
from the taxpayers to

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,650
the banks, it would on some
level solve the problem.

49
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,630
And if people really aren't
aware of it, everyone will be

50
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,310
happy about it, because all of
these banks, Citibank and Bank

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,420
of America, will just survive,
and they can just kind of say

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,880
that all's well.

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,250
So what I wanted to do, just to
answer those questions, is

54
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,590
get a little bit particular
about the wording.

55
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,580
And I got an email.

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,990
Leigh Logan actually emailed
me, and she highlighted one

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,280
clause in the Legacy Loans
term sheet that seems to

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,500
address what I talk about in
that second video there.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,680
And this is from the Legacy
Loans terms sheet.

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,990
It says: "Private investors
may not participate in any

61
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,920
PPIF"-- so this is that
Private-Public Investment

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,200
Fund-- "that purchases assets
from sellers that are

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,420
affiliates of such investors or
that represent 10% or more

64
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,550
of the aggregate private
capital in the PPIF."

65
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,210
So the question is what's
an affiliate?

66
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,790
And I looked it up in the
Securities Exchange Act of

67
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,750
1934, and there are multiple
definitions.

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,050
But this is probably
the best one.

69
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,110
It says: "The term affiliate
means any company that

70
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,720
controls, is controlled by, or
is under common control with

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,930
another company." And that's an
area that I just outlined.

72
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,220
This bank really
doesn't control

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,650
this hedge fund, right?

74
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,540
They just essentially gave them
a loan with very little

75
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,220
stipulations on it, and then the
hedge fund can go do it.

76
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,590
But, you could say, oh, well,
you know, there's nothing that

77
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,150
this bank could do to force this
hedge fund to buy these

78
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,190
assets, so maybe this
plan won't work.

79
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,459
And another thing is what's
the definition

80
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,700
of the private capital?

81
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,040
You also can't represent
10% more of the

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,950
aggregate private capital.

83
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,990
Frankly, when I think of private
capital, I think more

84
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,440
in terms of equity investments,
but maybe the

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,670
definition of private capital
also includes debt

86
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,720
investments, although,
I doubt it.

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,500
So in this video I want to
lay out a scenario that,

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,830
essentially, it can do the same
thing economically, and

89
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,850
in fact, the exact behavior
that they want in other

90
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,760
parties without being in any
way an affiliate of the

91
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,670
counterparty and in
no way giving

92
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,820
capital directly to them.

93
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,470
So what Bank A could do
instead-- let me redraw it.

94
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,320
Actually, not Bank A.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,500
The bank that's holding
toxic asset A.

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,760
And this is what I thought of
after kind of thinking about

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,300
it for about five
or ten minutes.

98
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,780
You could imagine what the banks
will come up with when

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,130
they have billions of dollars
and careers on the line.

100
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,260
So if you have a scenario where
you have this toxic

101
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,510
asset A, and you economically
want to do what I describe,

102
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,870
but you don't want to be an
affiliate and you don't want

103
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,990
to give the appearance of
self-dealing, what you do is

104
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,960
you sell credit defaults on A
that become supercheap, so you

105
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,420
have essentially $7 exposure
of credit defaults.

106
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,160
Let me do it this way.

107
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,780
So what you do is you sell
credit default swaps.

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,190
So let's say you sell
$7 of exposure.

109
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:44,430
So your liability right here,
is a seven-dollar CDS

110
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,710
exposure, and I'll go over
the economics of how

111
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,170
this works in a second.

112
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,620
And you actually get some
of the income stream.

113
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,900
It wouldn't even be accounted
this way.

114
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,490
You normally just have to-- if
you're insuring $7 worth of

115
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,570
credit default swaps, your
liability isn't $7.

116
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,260
You do the probability of
default and all that, so your

117
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,830
liability will probably be-- I
don't know, $1.00, whatever it

118
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,290
is, and you get some income
stream for it.

119
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:14,530
But the general notion is that
you sell credit default swaps

120
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:20,710
on this toxic asset, on
A, for really cheap.

121
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,060
   

122
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,970
And just so you know what a
credit default swap is, I've

123
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,400
made a couple of videos on it,
it is essentially an insurance

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,690
policy on a loan or on a
company, and if that company

125
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,380
or this loan defaults, you say
that you are going to pay up

126
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,350
essentially the insurance
amount.

127
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,600
So what you do is you sell $7 of
credit defaults swaps on A.

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,710
And just so you know, most of
these toxic assets that these

129
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,450
banks hold, these are assets
that they were the originators

130
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,000
for, and so, they're
very particular to

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,550
the individual banks.

132
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,870
So a bank can definitely say I'm
selling a credit default

133
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,930
swap on A, and they know that,
in the end, when I kind of

134
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,910
outline this whole thing,
they'll be the main

135
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,670
beneficiary of it.

136
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,420
So if you sell $7 of credit
defaults swaps on A, what

137
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,250
would I do?

138
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,010
Well, I'm a hedge fund.

139
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,630
What I do is I buy those credit

140
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,240
defaults for really cheap.

141
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,090
And then I invest in
the TALF, right?

142
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,250
So let's say I'm a hedge fund,
and I have two things.

143
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:29,760
I have a $7 investment in the
TALF-- sorry, in this Geithner

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,800
Plan, and then I also have this
credit default swap, this

145
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,590
insurance contract.

146
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,050
And just so you know, depending
on the price, you

147
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,920
pay a certain amount
every year.

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,170
But the key here is that this
bank could sell it, if they

149
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,540
wanted to, for almost free.

150
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,420
They could essentially
give away these

151
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,530
credit default swaps.

152
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,820
So if that bank did it, then the
hedge fund's assets would

153
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,825
have the $7 investment in this
Geithner program, and then

154
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:04,150
it'll have $7 of credit default
swap protection.

155
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,340
   

156
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,350
Now what happens to
this hedge fund?

157
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,670
In the world where asset A is
worth a lot, they get all of

158
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,410
the upside through their
investment in

159
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,880
the Geithner Plan.

160
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,330
That $7 investment gets
levered to $100.

161
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,710
Let me actually draw
that again.

162
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,510
So that $7 investment
is here, $7

163
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,550
capital, $7 from the Treasury.

164
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,120
You have $86 from the Fed, and
they use this to give the cash

165
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,820
here, and then that goes
back here, and you're

166
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,970
holding toxic asset A.

167
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,380
Now if toxic asset A ends up
being worth a lot of money,

168
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,140
then this is worth a lot, and
this is worth nothing, And

169
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,240
that's OK, because the hedge
fund essentially paid nothing

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,110
for it or paid next to nothing
for it, in which case,

171
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,970
everyone kind of works out
well in that scenario.

172
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,260
On the other hand, let's say
that this thing is worth zero.

173
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,820
Let's say that this
thing defaults.

174
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,380
If that thing defaults, then
this investment is worth zero.

175
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,060
But guess what?

176
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,140
The hedge fund had an insurance
policy, where this

177
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,070
guy was a counterparty.

178
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,740
So he says, hey, this thing
here defaulted.

179
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,720
I'm going to claim my insurance
policy, so this

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,720
guy's going to have
to send him $7.

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,850
So it's economically the exact
same thing that I outlined in

182
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,600
the Geithner Two video, but in
this situation, these guys,

183
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,560
it's almost an arms-length
transaction.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,380
But this bank can make that
behavior happen by essentially

185
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,810
going into the market and
selling credit default swaps

186
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,020
for this exact asset for
really, really cheap.

187
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,540
And this is just the first
way I thought about it.

188
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,620
There's other ways
you could do it.

189
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,090
If you're just a separate hedge
fund and you own enough

190
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,000
of the shares in a bank, let's
say you owned all of the

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,580
shares of the bank or a good
percentage of the shares of

192
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,760
the bank, then you would also
have an incentive to go out

193
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,260
there and use the Geithner
Plan and lever up and buy

194
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,790
these assets.

195
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,760
Another thing is-- I don't want
to get too technical --if

196
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,450
you kind of hold one of the
fulcrum pieces of debt, the

197
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,310
pieces of debt that are trading
at a discount, because

198
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,740
you're afraid that this bank is
going to fail, if you hold

199
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,350
a bunch of those assets,
you still would want to

200
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,070
participate in the Geithner Plan
and funnel money and use

201
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,280
the Government money to
essentially buy this asset A.

202
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,630
I mean, the general theme here
is, if you have two people, if

203
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,500
this is the private world and
you have a scenario where

204
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:35,360
person A, if a transaction can
make $100 or he gets rid of

205
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,770
$100 exposure, and person B
essentially has a potential

206
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,640
loss of minus $7 of exposure,
there's a net transfer of

207
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
wealth here.

208
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,190
You went from $100 of exposure
to $7 exposure for this guy.

209
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,110
So someone is offloading the $93
of exposure to this stuff,

210
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,090
and that's the Government.

211
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,670
The Government's only taking
the down side.

212
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,100
So this is a huge subsidy of
exposure, and it depends what

213
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,860
these are really worth, if this
thing is really worth $30

214
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,680
and it's a $63 exposure, but
any time you have this, the

215
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,680
private sector is going to
figure out a way to make this

216
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,870
subsidy happen.

217
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,940
And everything I've outlined
so far is if A is the bank

218
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,450
that has 100% exposure, all they
have to do is, through

219
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,460
whatever back-door scheme or
financial product or insurance

220
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,790
or whatever they want to do, or
loans that have very little

221
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,050
stipulations on it, they just
have to give this guy

222
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,390
essentially $7 of compensation
somehow that gets around the

223
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,930
Government rules, and then this
transaction will occur.

224
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,740
And I hope it doesn't occur,
and it's very possible it

225
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,400
won't, because maybe I'm missing
something here, but

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm just saying that everything
I understand about

227
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,280
the Geithner Plan is that
there's a huge incentive for

228
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,090
this to occur, and this is
frankly the only reason why

229
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,240
the plan would work.

230
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,000
Because, as I outlined in the
other videos, for a private

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,020
investor who's not incentivized
in this way, the

232
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,380
put option that the Government
is giving them still is not

233
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,220
enough of a rationale to go from
paying $30 for an asset

234
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,510
to going to pay $60 an asset.

235
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,930
So it won't work if this
behavior doesn't occur.

236
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,900
The only way that the plan quote
unquote will work and

237
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,410
people will overpay for the
assets is if you have this

238
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,650
type of action going on.
