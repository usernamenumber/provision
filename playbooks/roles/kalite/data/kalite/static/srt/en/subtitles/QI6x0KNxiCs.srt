1
00:00:00,536 --> 00:00:09,113
We've got 24 triangle things here, what I want to do in this video is to divide it into different numbers of groups.

2
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:16,536
So the first thing I want to do is I want to divide this 24 triangle things, I want to divide it into 3 groups,

3
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:20,069
and think about how many do I end up with per group.

4
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:24,446
So let's try that out... So I'm going to divide into 3 equal groups.

5
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:36,278
So that is one equal group right over there... Then I have another equal group right over here... And then I have a third equal group right over here.

6
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:43,937
So if I divide 24 into 3 equal groups... 1, 2, 3... How many are going to be in each group?

7
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:52,402
Well we can count that! We have 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... in each group.

8
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:59,279
So we can say that 24 divided by 3 is equal to 8.

9
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:02,946
Now you might say, "Hey! This is very similar to what we saw in multiplication!"

10
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:10,612
In Multiplication, we said, "if we have 3 groups of 8 we can view that as 3 times 8 and get 24."

11
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,403
And you are exactly right!

12
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:32,003
We could also write that 3 times 8, so if we have 3 groups of 8, then that is going to be equal to 24.

13
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,946
So we started in this video, we had 24 things, we want to divide it into 3 equal groups, we got 8 in each group.

14
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:45,203
Or you can say 3 equal groups of 8 is equal to 24.

15
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:52,699
But there's even other ways of thinking about this. (So let me clear this up a little bit)...

16
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:05,612
So in the first example, I've divided 24 into 3 equal groups... but you can also view 24 divided by 3 as dividing 24 into groups of 3!

17
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:10,804
So let's think about what that looks like... so if we divide into groups of 3...

18
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:20,803
Then for example, this is a group of 3. That is a group of 3. This is a group of 3. You might see where this is going...

19
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:28,869
That's a group of 3... That is another group of 3... We're going to think about how many groups of 3 we're actually going to get...

20
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:35,696
So, this is another group of 3... and that's another group of 3.

21
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:44,862
So... how many groups of 3 did we get? Well let's see... we have 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8 groups of 3.

22
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:56,946
So another way of viewing 24 divided by 3 is divide 24 into groups of 3, and then you will have 8 groups of 3.

23
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:03,003
And one way of thinking about this... if you want to express the same thing in terms of multiplication...

24
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:12,946
If you have 8 groups of 3, that is also going to be equal to 24.

25
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:21,403
Whether you have 3 groups of 8 or 8 groups of 3... either way, you're going to have 24.

26
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:25,697
Now... let's make things more interesting...

27
00:03:25,697 --> 00:03:28,202
What I want you to think about is:

28
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:46,029
What is 24 divided by 12? And I encourage you to pause the video, draw out 24 triangles like this, and try to figure out what 24 divided by 12 is.

29
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:51,203
Well... I assume you have paused the video, and there's two ways to think about 24 divided by 12.

30
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:58,804
You could say... let's divide 24 into groups of 12, and think about how many groups we have... So we can do that.

31
00:03:58,804 --> 00:04:12,779
So let's see... this is... 1 group of 12 right over here. And then here is another group of 12. So... How many groups of 12 do we have?

32
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:18,868
Well, we have 2 groups of 12, so we could say 24 divided by 12 is 2.

33
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:30,536
But another, just as reasonable, way of doing this.... You could have said, "Well... let me divide 24 into 12 groups, instead of groups of 12."

34
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:35,113
So if I want to divide into 12 groups... 12 equal groups... Well let's see...

35
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:56,613
So this is 1 equal group... 2 equal groups... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12.

36
00:04:56,613 --> 00:05:02,402
So once again, if you say "I'm going to divide 24 into 12 equal groups, how many do you have in each group?"

37
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:09,138
Well you have 2. So once again 24 can be viewed as 24 divided into 12 equal groups and how many do you have in each group,

38
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:15,736
or 24 divided into groups of 12, and how many groups would you have? And that's what we saw in the last example.

39
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:18,337
So now let's make things even more interesting...

40
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:22,946
I want you to think about a couple of things:

41
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:31,279
What 24 divided by 6 is...

42
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:41,469
And I also want you to figure out what 24 divided by 4 is.

43
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:45,335
Once again, I encourage you to pause the video, draw out these triangles, and figure it out.

44
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:49,030
What is 24 divided by 6, and 24 divided by 4?

45
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,469
So let's tackle 24 divided by 6 first.

46
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:57,736
So I'll view this as: let's try divide 24 into 6 equal groups.

47
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:11,279
So let's see... this could be 1 equal group... 2 equal groups... in fact each group here is a group of 4, and we have 6 rows...

48
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:24,736
So 3 equal groups, 4... 5... and 6. So if you divide 24 into 6 equal groups, how many do you have in each group?

49
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:29,403
Well, it's pretty clear: you have 4 in each group.

50
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:43,279
Another way we could have thought about that... is we could have said, "Let me divide 24 into groups of 6."

51
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,403
So if you divide 24 into groups of 6... You could have viewed it as this:

52
00:06:48,403 --> 00:07:01,446
So that's is 1 group of 6 right there... That's another group of 6 right over here... That's another group of 6... and I think you can see how many groups of 6 we have.

53
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:10,280
We have 4 groups of 6.

54
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:20,737
Well, now let's think what 24 divided by 4 is. Well, if I view 24 divided by 4 as taking 24 into 4 equal groups, I've just drawn that!

55
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:24,779
I have 4 equal groups, and in each group I have 6.

56
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:34,113
So notice: 24 divided by 6 is 4, and 24 divided by 4 is 6.

57
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:38,113
And that's because I can view this as 4 groups of 6 (4 times 6 is equal to 24). Or you can just as equivalently say that 6 times 4 is 24.
