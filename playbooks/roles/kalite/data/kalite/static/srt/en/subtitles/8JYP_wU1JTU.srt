1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,569
As we begin our journey into the world of economics,

2
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:08,902
I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all time,

3
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,514
the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith.

4
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:15,035
And he really is kind of the first real economist

5
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:17,037
in the way that we view it now.

6
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,309
And this is from his The Wealth of Nations,

7
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:24,369
published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as

8
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,594
the American Declaration of Independence, and it's one of his most-famous excerpts.

9
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:34,104
He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest,

10
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,263
nor knows how much he is promoting it.

11
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:39,769
By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor

12
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:44,042
in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value,

13
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,260
he intends only his own gain.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,102
'He intends only his own gain'.

15
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:53,770
And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,770
to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,435
And this term "the invisible hand" is famous.

18
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:04,932
Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.

19
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,180
He is saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest,

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,300
that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend.

21
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,641
Then he says: nor is it always the worst for society

22
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,175
that it was no part of it.

23
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,929
So, it was not necessarily a bad thing.

24
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,436
By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes

25
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:28,702
that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

26
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:30,590
So, this is really a pretty strong statement.

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,597
It's really at the core of capitalism.

28
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,179
And that's why I point out that it was published

29
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,970
in the same year as the American Declaration of Independence,

30
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,905
because obviously America, the Funding Fathers,

31
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:42,182
they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution,

32
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:45,176
that really talks about what it means to be a democratic country,

33
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:46,775
what are the rights of its citizens.

34
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:52,041
But the United States, with its overall experience of an American,

35
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,967
is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith,

36
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:58,569
by this kind of foundational ideas of capitalism.

37
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,265
And they just both happened to happen around the same time.

38
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:08,102
But this idea is not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing

39
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:12,836
their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society than

40
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:18,104
than if any of them actually tried to promote the overall well-being of society.

41
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:22,907
And I don't think that Adam Smith would say that it's always good

42
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:24,843
for someone to act self-interested, or that it's never good for people to actually

43
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:29,900
think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense,

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,514
but he is saying that frequently .. frequently, this self-interested action

45
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:38,436
<i>could</i> lead to the greater good. Could lead to more innovation.

46
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:44,309
Could lead to better investment. Could lead to more productivity. COuld lead to more wealth,

47
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:47,438
more, a larger pie for everyone.

48
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:53,435
And now Economics is frequently .. and when he makes a statement, he is actually making

49
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:56,101
a mix of micro-economic and macro-economic statements.

50
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:00,102
Micro is that people, individual actors are acting out of their own self-interest.

51
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:04,262
And the macro is that it might be good for the economy, or the nation as a whole.

52
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:08,767
And so, now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools,

53
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:16,233
or into these two subjects: microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors.

54
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:21,565
Microeconomics .. and those actors could be firms, could be people, it could be households.

55
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:25,840
And you have macro-economics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,107
Macro-economics. And you get it from the words.

57
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:34,929
Micro -- the prefix refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger,

58
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,347
to the bigger picture.

59
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:42,588
And so, micro-economics is essentially how actors .. actors make decisions

60
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:49,310
or, you could actually say 'allocations', allocations .. decisions or allocations.

61
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,102
Allocation ..

62
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:55,636
of scarce resources. And you hear the words scarce resources a lot

63
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,969
when people talk about economics.

64
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:01,304
And a scarce resource is one you don't have an infinite amount of.

65
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:06,377
For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love.

66
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:13,925
But a resource that would be scarce is something like food, or water, or money, or time, or labor.

67
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:19,682
These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is how do people decide

68
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:23,703
where to put those scarce resource, how do they decide where to deploy them.

69
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:27,775
And how does that .. does that affect prices and markets, and whatever else.

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,708
Macro-economics is the study of what happens at the aggregate to an economy.

71
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:38,601
So, 'aggregate', what happens in aggregate to an economy, from the millions of individual actors.

72
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:45,770
Aggregate economy. We now have millions of actors.

73
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,900
And often focuses on policy-related questions.

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,701
SO, do you raise or lower taxes. Or, what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes.

75
00:04:54,701 --> 00:05:00,036
Do you regulate or de-regulate? How does that affect the overall productivity

76
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:06,926
when you do this. So, it's policy, top-down .. 'top-down' questions.

77
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:12,434
And in both macro- and micro-economics, there is especially in the modern sense of it,

78
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:16,236
there is an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical.

79
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:20,845
So, in either case you could start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas,

80
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:24,569
so of the logical ideas, to say someone like Adam Smith might have.

81
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:31,596
So, you have these basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions.

82
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:38,102
So, philosophy, 'philosophy' of people, of decision-making,

83
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:42,569
in the case of micro-economics -- 'decision-making'

84
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,634
And then you make some assumptions about it.

85
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:49,593
Or you simplify it .. let me write this .. you simplify it.

86
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:53,846
And you really are simplifying. You say "oh, all people are rational",

87
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:57,570
"all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain",

88
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,601
which isn't true -- human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things.

89
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:06,272
We simplify things, so we can start to deal with it kind of a mathematical way.

90
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:11,368
SO you simplify it, so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense.

91
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,930
So, this is valuable to clarify your thinking.

92
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,513
It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions.

93
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:21,522
And so, you can start to visualize things mathematically, with charts and graphs

94
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:23,841
and think about what would actually happen with markets.

95
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,436
So it's very valuable to have this mathematical, rigorous, thinking.

96
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:32,677
But at the same time, it could be a little bit dangerous, because you are making

97
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:37,702
these huge simplifications, and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions.

98
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:43,341
Conclusions, which you might feel very strongly about, because it looks like you've proven them

99
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:46,977
in the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based

100
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:50,430
on some assumptions that either might be wrong, or might be over-simplifications,

101
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,511
or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about.

102
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:59,036
So it's very very very important to take it all with a grain of salt,

103
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:02,369
to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumption.

104
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:05,675
And macro-economics is probably more guilty of it.

105
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,367
In micro-economics you are taking these deeply complicated things that are

106
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,926
the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then

107
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:17,511
you are aggregating it over millions of people, so it's ultra-complicated.

108
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,509
You've millions of these infinitely complicated people, all interacting with each other.

109
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,512
SO, it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions, and

110
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:31,186
fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those,

111
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:37,369
trying to make assumptions and then doing math with that --

112
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:41,570
that could lead you to some conclusions or might be leading you to some predictions.

113
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,702
And, once again, this is very important. This is valuable, it is valuable to make these mathematical models,

114
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,969
with these mathematical assumptions for these mathematical conclusions,

115
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,260
but it always need to be taken with a grain of salt.

116
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,256
So, then you have a proper grain of salt, so that you are always focused on the true intuition.

117
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:02,641
And that's really the most important thing to get from a course on economics.

118
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:05,338
So you can truly reason through what's likely to happen,

119
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,969
maybe even without the mathematics.

120
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:11,103
I'll leave you with two quotes. And thse quotes are a little bit .. a little bit funny,

121
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:15,268
but they're really I think helpful things to keep in mind,

122
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:17,842
especially when you go deep into the mathematical side of economics.

123
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:24,680
So, this right over here is a quote by Aflred Knopf, who was publisher in the 1900s.

124
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,847
"An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible."

125
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:34,238
And I'm assuming what he is talking about as the incomprehensible, he is referring to some of the 'mathy' stuff

126
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:37,767
that you see in economics, and hopefully we're going to make this

127
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,507
as comprehensible as possible.

128
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,172
You'll see there is value in this.

129
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:43,256
But it's a very important statement he is making.

130
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,436
Oftentimes, it's taking a common-sense thing.

131
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:49,103
It's taking something that's obvious .. that's obvious.

132
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:53,181
And it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that

133
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:56,301
you have the intuition for what's happening in the math,

134
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,176
or to know when the math is going into a direction that might be strange

135
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:02,370
based on over-simplifications or wrong assumptions.

136
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,644
And then you have this quote here by Lawrence J. Peter,

137
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,569
most famous for Peter's Principals, a professor at USC.

138
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,436
"An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things

139
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:14,597
he predicted yesterday didn't happen today."

140
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:17,436
And once again -- important to keep in the back of one's mind,

141
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:21,436
because especially relevant to macro-economics, because in macro-economics

142
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:26,108
there is always all sorts of prediction about the state of the economy:

143
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:30,847
about what need to be done, about how long the recession will last, what will be the economic growth next year,

144
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:34,264
what will inflation do ... and they often prove to be wrong.

145
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:38,036
In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things.

146
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:42,037
And it's very important to realize that, because oftentimes when you are deep

147
00:09:42,037 --> 00:09:46,436
in the mathematics, economics might <i>seem</i> to be a science, like physics,

148
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:50,768
but it's not a science like physics. It is open .. it is open to subjectivity,
