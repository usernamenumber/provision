1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,662
We're in Saint Peter's Basilica,

2
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,013
standing in front of Michelangelo's Pieta

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:13,542
I feel very lucky because on this rainy Monday morning,

4
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:14,645
we're the only ones

5
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:17,179
and it actually looks quite small

6
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,830
in relationship to the chapel that holds it

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,462
but also just especially in relationship to

8
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:25,079
St. Peters, which is so vast

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,979
Of course, this sculpture was made for the cardinal

10
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:30,639
but then it was placed in the old St. Peters

11
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,013
which was significantly smaller

12
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:33,601
than this one

13
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,904
and so it would have had a different relationship

14
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,013
to the architecture

15
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:40,079
what I'm finding interesting is despite the fact

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:40,962
that it's relatively small

17
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:42,879
and probably about 20 feet away from us

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,605
it's still a really intimate image

19
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,879
there really is this extraordinary

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,479
relationship that Michelangelo has

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,679
constructed between the body of

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,317
the dead Christ and his mother

23
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:55,912
the Virgin Mary, who holds him on her lap

24
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:58,878
Mary looks very young and beautiful

25
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,013
like her body is

26
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,244
and her lap is sort of enlarged

27
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,829
to carry the body of her dead son

28
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:07,429
the realism of that dead body

29
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,091
of its weight

30
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:11,563
one of the most beautiful passages i think

31
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,579
of the sculpture is the way she holds up

32
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,579
his right arm and pulls up that flesh a little bit

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,271
and you really feel for a second

34
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:22,362
first of all that the marble is transformed

35
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,000
by Michelangelo with the flesh

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,737
and the weight of that body

37
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,920
through that weight the loss of life

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,576
that's so palpable for Mary

39
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:32,596
it's the complete lack of resistance

40
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,879
that his body offers

41
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:36,567
and the exertion that she has to extend

42
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:37,962
in order to hold it

43
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:38,779
and that contrast

44
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,013
makes for the viewer i think

45
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,729
in a very physical experience looking at this sculpture

46
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,162
his body looks so much like the body

47
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:47,763
of a real, young man

48
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,997
the rib cage, the abdominal muscles

49
00:01:49,997 --> 00:01:53,166
and yet it's also idealized in the way

50
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:55,500
in which there's this beautiful turn of his body

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,429
across her lap

52
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:57,662
and for Mary as well

53
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:59,333
there's this interesting contradiction

54
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,061
in her sweetness and beauty

55
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,342
but also the strength and the scale

56
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:06,362
that's necessary for her to easily hold him

57
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:08,804
look how deeply carved that marble is

58
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:09,843
the drapery

59
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:12,728
this real love of the turn of the stone

60
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:15,368
creating this very vivid sense

61
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,644
of light and shadow

62
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,612
the complexity of the surface

63
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,180
against the broad, pure surfaces

64
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,128
of Christ's legs

65
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:25,095
of his torso, of his arms

66
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:28,067
Mary tilts her head forward and looks down

67
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,846
at him, his head is thrown back

68
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:34,112
so there's something between those two necks

69
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,029
for me

70
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,896
And his neck is exposed

71
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,329
to us, incredibly vulnerable

72
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:40,793
Christ's foot hangs in midair

73
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,979
Mary, her left hand is open

74
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,096
and pointing delicately forward

75
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,443
as if she's still trying to comprehend his death

76
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,430
but I think there's also a way of presenting

77
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,595
Christ's body to the viewer

78
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,247
saying this is the path to salvation

79
00:02:56,247 --> 00:02:58,396
this is God's sacrifice for mankind

80
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,395
MY sacrifice of my son

81
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:03,479
that makes possible your redemption

82
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,828
there is a kind of rhythm that points to that hand

83
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:09,663
the drape and the knee point up towards

84
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:11,112
Christ's knees which in turn,

85
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:13,129
create a kind of rhythmic bridge to her hand

86
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,703
and to that sense of wondering

87
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:17,013
this is very clearly an image

88
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,195
that is meant to be contemplated

89
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:19,829
and the pain and the suffering

90
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,531
that Christ has endured

91
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:25,183
That Mary's enduring is meant to be contemplated

92
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:26,578
as a pathway

93
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,864
[whirring] They're polishing the floor!

94
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:29,951
Okay let's move on!
