1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,760
SAL: In the last video, where
we talked about macrostates,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,460
we set up this situation where
I had this canister, or the

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,980
cylinder, and had this
movable ceiling.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,000
I call that a piston.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And the piston is being kept
up by the pressure from the

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,905
gas in the canister.

7
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:19,960
And it's being kept down by, in
the last example I had, a

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,520
rock or a weight on top.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,820
And above that I had a vacuum.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,090
So essentially there's some
force per area, or pressure,

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,790
being applied by the
bumps of the

12
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,260
particles into this piston.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,409
And if this weight wasn't here--
let's assume that the

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,920
piston itself or this movable
ceiling itself, it has no

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,490
mass-- if that weight wasn't
there it would just be pushed

16
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,000
indefinitely far, because
there'd be no pressure from

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,460
the vacuum.

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,360
But this weight is applying
some force on

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,960
that same area downwards.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,160
So we're at some equilibrium
point, some stability.

21
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,430
And we plotted that on this
PV diagram right here.

22
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,910
I'll do it in magenta.

23
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,390
So that's our state 1 that
we were in right there.

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,410
And then what I did in the last
video, I just blew away

25
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,750
half of this block.

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,210
And as soon as I blew away half
of this block, obviously

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,080
the force that's being applied
by the block will immediately

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,660
go down by half, and so the
gas will push up on it.

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,900
And it happened so fast that,
al of a sudden the gas is

30
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,940
pushing up.

31
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,700
Right when it happens, the gas
near the top of the canister

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,260
is going to have lower pressure,
because it has less

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,250
pushing up against it.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,560
The molecules that are down here
don't even know that I

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,010
blew away this block yet.

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,090
It's going to take some time.

37
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,280
And essentially the gas is going
to push it up, and then

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,950
maybe it'll oscillate down,
and then push it up, and

39
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,290
oscillate down a little bit.

40
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,910
It'll take some time eventually
until we get to

41
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,890
another equilibrium state, where
we have a new, probably,

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,510
or definitely lower pressure.

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,150
We definitely have
a higher volume.

44
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,300
I won't talk too much about it
yet, but we probably have a

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,960
lower temperature as well.

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,380
And this is our new state.

47
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,110
And our macrostate's pressure
and volume are defined once

48
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,770
we're at the new equilibrium,
so we're right here.

49
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,690
So my question in the
last video was,

50
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,780
how did we get here?

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,900
Is there any way to have defined
a path to get from our

52
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,970
first state-- where pressure and
volume were well defined,

53
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:17,520
because the system was in
thermodynamic equilibrium-- to

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,330
get to our second state?

55
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,400
And the answer was no.

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,460
Because between this state
and this state

57
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,790
all hell broke loose.

58
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,960
I had different temperatures
at different

59
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,110
points in the system.

60
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,580
I could have had a different
pressure here

61
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,030
than I had up here.

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,770
The volume might have
been fluctuating

63
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,080
from moment to moment.

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,220
So when you're outside of
equilibrium-- and I had

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,310
written it down over there--
you cannot define, or you

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,160
can't say that those macro
variables are well defined.

67
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,710
So there was no path that you
could say how we got from--

68
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,510
erase this-- how we got from
state 1 to state 2.

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,470
You could just say, OK, we
were in some type of

70
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,380
equilibrium.

71
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,840
So we were in state 1.

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,860
Then I blew away
half the rock.

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,430
The pressure went down,
the volume went up.

74
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,800
The temperature also
probably went down.

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,100
And so I ended up in this other
state once I reached

76
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,440
equilibrium.

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,290
And that's all fair and good,
but wouldn't it have been nice

78
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,780
if there was some way?

79
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,400
If we could have said, look,
you know, there's some way

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,750
that we got from this
point to this point?

81
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,080
If we could perform my little
rock experiment in a slightly

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,850
different manner, so that all
this hell didn't break loose,

83
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,600
so that maybe at every point in
between my macro variables

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,940
are actually defined?

85
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,870
So how could I do that?

86
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,190
Remember, I said that the
macro variables, the

87
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,030
macrostates, whether it's
pressure, temperature, volume,

88
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,740
and there are others, but I said
these are only defined

89
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,090
when we are in a thermodynamic
equilibrium.

90
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,940
And that just means that
things have reached a

91
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,830
stability point.

92
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,510
That, for example, the
temperature is consistent

93
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,440
throughout the system.

94
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,690
If it's not consistent
throughout the system, I

95
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,720
shouldn't be talking about it.

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
If the temperature is different
here than it is up

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,750
here, I shouldn't say that
the temperature of

98
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,630
the system is x.

99
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,850
It's different at different
points.

100
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,010
I really can't make a
well-defined statement about

101
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,890
temperature, similar for
pressure or for volume,

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,650
because the volume is
also fluctuating.

103
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,830
But what if I perform that
same experiment?

104
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,279
That same process,
I should call it.

105
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,740
Let me draw it again.

106
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,660
So I have my canister.

107
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,250
And instead of starting with a
rock, just one big rock-- let

108
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,830
me draw, this is my piston right
here, at the top of the

109
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,850
movable ceiling of
the cylinder.

110
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,960
And I have some gas
inside of it.

111
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,290
Instead of having just one big
rock like I had over here, how

112
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,990
about I start with an equal
weight of rock?

113
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,660
But let's say I have a bunch of
small pebbles that add up

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,600
to that same rock.

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,540
So just a bunch of, well, you
know, just a pile of pebbles.

116
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,435
You know, maybe they're sand.

117
00:04:55,435 --> 00:05:01,520
They're super duper small.

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,410
Instead of just blowing away
half of the sand all at once,

119
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,480
like I did with that rock over
there, and immediately jumping

120
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,230
to that state and throwing the
whole system into this

121
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,340
undefined state of
non-equilibrium.

122
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,950
Instead of doing that, let me
just do things very slowly and

123
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,670
very gently.

124
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,820
Let me just take out one grain
of sand at a time.

125
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,195
So if I just take out
one grain of sand.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,170
And so I took out an

127
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,110
infinitesimal amount of weight.

128
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,600
So what's going to happen?

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,700
Well this piston's going to
move up a little bit.

130
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,650
And let me draw that.

131
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,360
So let me copy and paste it.

132
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,090
So I just took out one
little piece of sand.

133
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,250
The force pushing down will
be a little bit less.

134
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,770
The pressure pushing down
will be a little less.

135
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,740
And so my piston-- let me see
if I can draw this-- it will

136
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,610
have moved up-- let me erase
it-- it will have moved up a

137
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,510
very infinitesimal--
infinitesimal means an

138
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,720
infinitely small amount-- it
would have moved an infinitely

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,120
small amount of time.

140
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,830
And so you wouldn't have thrown
that system into this,

141
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,480
you know, havoc that I
did this last time.

142
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,430
Of course, we haven't moved
all the way here yet.

143
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,880
But what we have done is, we
would have moved from that

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,030
point maybe to this other point
right here that's just a

145
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,780
little bit closer to there.

146
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,210
I've just removed a little
bit of the weight.

147
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,090
So my pressure went down
just a little bit.

148
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,930
And my volume went up
a just a little bit.

149
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,760
Temperature probably
went down.

150
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,910
And the key here is I'm trying
to do it in such small

151
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,630
increments that as I do it, my
system is pretty much super

152
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,190
close to equilibrium.

153
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm just doing it just slow
enough that at every step it

154
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,470
achieves equilibrium
almost immediately.

155
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,720
Or it's almost in equilibrium
the whole time I'm doing it.

156
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,390
And then I do it again,
and do it again.

157
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,530
And I'll just draw my drawings
a little less neat, just for

158
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,440
the sake of time.

159
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,620
Let's say I remove another
little dot of sand that's

160
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,380
infinitely small mass.

161
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,050
And now my little piston will
move just a little bit higher.

162
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,540
And I have, remember I have one
less sand up here than I

163
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,800
had over here.

164
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,030
And then my volume in my gas
increases a little bit.

165
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,230
My pressure goes down
a little bit.

166
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,260
And I've moved to
this point here.

167
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
What I'm doing here is I'm
setting up what's called a

168
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,120
quasi-static process.

169
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,830
And the reason why it's
called that is

170
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,890
because it's almost static.

171
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,790
It's almost in equilibrium
the whole time.

172
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,280
Every time I move a grain of
sand I'm just moving a little

173
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
bit closer.

174
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,820
And obviously even a grain of
sand, the reality is if I were

175
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,220
to do this in real life, even
a grain of sand on a small

176
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,530
scale is going to reek
a little bit

177
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,040
of havoc on my system.

178
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,820
This piston is going to
go up a little bit.

179
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,525
So say, let me just do even a
smaller grain of sand, and do

180
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,400
it even a little bit slower
so that I'm always in

181
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,270
equilibrium.

182
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,440
So you can imagine this is kind
of a theoretical thing.

183
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,840
If I did an infinitely small
grains of sand, and did it

184
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,000
just slow enough so that it's
just gently moved from this

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,200
point to this point.

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,210
But we like to think of it
theoretically, because it

187
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,390
allows us to describe a path.

188
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,960
Because remember, why am I
being so careful here?

189
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,890
Why am I so careful to make
sure that the state, the

190
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,790
system is in equilibrium the
whole time when I get from

191
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,150
there to there?

192
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,700
Because our macrostates, our
macro variables like pressure,

193
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,049
volume, and temperature, our
only defined when we're in

194
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,000
equilibrium.

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,659
So if I do this process super
slowly, in super small

196
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,200
increments, it allows me to keep
my pressure and volume

197
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,270
and actually my temperature
of macrostates at

198
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,070
any point in time.

199
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,930
So I could actually
plot a path.

200
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,860
So if I keep doing it small,
small, small, I could actually

201
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,280
plot a path to say, how did I
get from state 1 to state 2 on

202
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,960
this on this PV diagram.

203
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,270
And you might say, hey, you
know, Sal, this is all-- And

204
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,580
I'll take a little
step back here.

205
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,480
I always found this
really confusing.

206
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,210
You know, you'll see a lot of
talk in thermodynamic circles,

207
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,920
or even in your book about--
it has to be a quasi-static

208
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,540
process, and I always used to
wonder, why are people going

209
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,870
through these pains to describe
this process where

210
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,340
you're removing sand
after sand?

211
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,070
And the whole point is because
you want to get as close to

212
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,960
equilibrium the whole time
you're doing it as possible so

213
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,780
that your pressure and volume
are defined the whole time.

214
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,970
The reality is, in the real
world you can never get

215
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,870
something that's continuously
defined, but you can just do

216
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,095
really, really, really
small increments.

217
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,950
So that at each small increment
you're at some

218
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,490
equilibrium.

219
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,460
And if you're not happy with
that, you can do even smaller

220
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,870
increments.

221
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,120
So at some point, at some
limiting point, you do have

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,970
some type of continuous state
change, while you're always in

223
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,600
equilibrium.

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,040
It's almost an oxymoron, because
you're saying you're

225
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,690
static, you're saying that
you're in equilibrium the

226
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,640
whole time, but clearly you're
also changing the whole time.

227
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,990
You keep removing little
pieces of sand.

228
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,770
But you're moving them just
slowly enough that all that

229
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,130
crazy up and down motion, and
all of the flux, and all of

230
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,730
the weird temperature changes
don't happen.

231
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,450
And it just, you know, just
that it slowly, slowly,

232
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,950
slowly creeps up.

233
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,180
The reason why I'm even going
through this exercise is

234
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,250
because it's key when we start
talking about thermodynamics

235
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,410
and these PV diagrams, and
we'll start talking about

236
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,980
carnot engines and all of that,
that we be able to at

237
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,250
least theoretically describe the
path that we take on this

238
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,280
PV diagram.

239
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,670
And we wouldn't have been able
to do that if we can't assume

240
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,210
that we're dealing with a
quasi-static process.

241
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,230
Now there's another term that
you'll hear in thermodynamic

242
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,240
circles that really, I mean, to
me it really, I don't know,

243
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,830
I had trouble comprehending it
the first time I heard it,

244
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,080
called reversible.

245
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,820
And sometimes these terms
quasi-static and reversible

246
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,275
are used interchangeably, but
there is a difference.

247
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,550
Reversible processes are
quasi-static, and most

248
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,620
quasi-static processes are
reversible, but there are a

249
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,150
few special cases that aren't.

250
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,660
But the idea of a reversible
process is something that

251
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,620
happens so slowly.

252
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,420
So in this example I took off
a grain of sand and I got to

253
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,950
the state, but if I assume that
no friction when, you

254
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,470
know, when this piston moved up
a little bit, in the real

255
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,130
world, let's say if this piston
was metal, when this

256
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,660
rubs against the canister,
there'd be a little bit of

257
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,170
friction generated and a little
bit of energy would be

258
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,930
dissipated as friction
or heat.

259
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,270
But in a reversible process,
we're assuming that, look,

260
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,520
this is frictionless.

261
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,500
When anything happens in the
system, when we go from this

262
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
state right here-- let's
say this the state a,

263
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,080
this is state b.

264
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,000
So this is state a,
this is state b.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,710
When we go from this state
to this state, one, we're

266
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,760
infinitesimally close to
equilibrium the whole time, so

267
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,910
all of our macrostates
are well defined.

268
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,670
And even more, when we move from
one state to the other,

269
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,840
there's no loss or dissipation
of energy.

270
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,570
So those are two important
characteristics.

271
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,850
One, infinitely close to
equilibrium at all times, and

272
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,870
no loss of energy.

273
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,540
And the reason why that matters
for a reversible

274
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,120
process is because if we wanted,
if we were sitting in

275
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,790
state b, we could just add
another grain of sand back in,

276
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,660
push down this piston infinitely
slowly, at an

277
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,180
infinitely small increment,
and get back to state a.

278
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,340
So that's why it's called
reversible.

279
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,380
You could be at this point right
here, and take out a

280
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,740
little bit of sand, and get
to this point right here.

281
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,440
But if you want, since no energy
was lost, you could add

282
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,970
a little bit of sand, and get
back to this point right here.

283
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,290
Now the reality in the real
world is, there is no such

284
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,540
thing as a perfectly
reversible process.

285
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,790
There will always be, whenever
you do anything, there will

286
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,090
always be some energy or heat
lost to the process.

287
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,400
In the real world, if I moved
down here, if I tried to put

288
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,750
the sand back I would lose some
energy and probably get

289
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,360
to a little slightly
different point.

290
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,645
But you don't have to
worry about that.

291
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:07,900
The important takeaway from
this video is that, in the

292
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,400
situation I described there,
there was no intermediate

293
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,480
macrostate variables, because
our system was in flux, it

294
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
wasn't in equilibrium.

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
So if we wanted to get
intermediate states, we just

296
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,600
have to essentially do
this process slower.

297
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,060
And so slow, I mean, it
theoretically would take you

298
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,090
forever, so we can only
approximate it.

299
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,100
But the sand gives you an idea
of what we're talking about.

300
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,000
And if we did it slowly with
these infinitesimally small

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,700
particles of sand, then we can
define the state at every

302
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,480
point along the process.

303
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,490
And that's why we call it
quasi-static, because at any

304
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,000
point it's almost static.

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,480
It's almost in equilibrium.

306
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,730
So our pressures, volumes, and
temperatures can be defined.

307
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,890
And if we add to that the notion
that we haven't lost

308
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,510
any heat when we're going in one
direction or another, we

309
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,420
could say it's reversible,
because if we took a piece of

310
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,050
sand away, we can always add
a little bit of sand next.

311
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,280
Now, actually, with that said,
let me give you the one

312
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,440
example of maybe a
quasi-static-- no, actually

313
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,910
I'll save that for
future video.

314
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,370
Anyway, hopefully you understand
that these are two

315
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,560
concepts that used to really
confuse me, and hopefully this

316
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,670
clears it up a little bit.

317
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,180
And I think more than what it
is, I think the first time I

318
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,210
read about them I'm like, OK,
well what's the big deal?

319
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,130
The big deal is, it allows you
to define your macrostates for

320
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,770
every state in between
these two states

321
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,540
that you care about.

322
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,880
When you just did it as
a regular kind of

323
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,040
non-quasi-static process,
in between you

324
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,980
don't know what happened.
