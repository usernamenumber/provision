1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,362
After World War II with most of Europe in ruins,

2
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:10,948
tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States.

3
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:14,099
It was clear that the next global superpower

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,090
required the ability to both launch and

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,010
successfully defend nuclear attacks

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,415
from intercontinental ballistic missiles.

7
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,017
In North America the most vulnerable point of attack

8
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:25,888
was over the north pole.

9
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:28,285
So in 1958, a joint effort between

10
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:31,253
United States and Canada was established,

11
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:32,534
known as NORAD, or

12
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:35,650
North American Aerospace Defense Command.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,564
An important line of defense with

14
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:40,479
the semi-automatic ground environment.

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,400
It was an automated system of over

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,866
100 long-distance radars

17
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,023
scattered across North America.

18
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:50,191
They were connected to computerized radar stations

19
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,179
that transmitted tracking data

20
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:55,293
using telephone lines or radio waves.

21
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:57,330
All of this radar information was fed

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,309
into a primary warning center

23
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,974
buried a mile deep

24
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,587
inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.

25
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:06,692
This application of machine-to-machine communication

26
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,630
allowed operators to make

27
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,307
split-second decisions using information

28
00:01:11,307 --> 00:01:15,525
transmitted and processed automatically by computers.

29
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:18,838
This idea of being on-line was quickly adapted

30
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:21,045
and advanced by universities in the following

31
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:22,747
years as they understood

32
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:24,945
the potential of computer networking.

33
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,464
The thing that makes the computer

34
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:28,692
communication network special

35
00:01:28,692 --> 00:01:31,263
is that it puts the workers that's

36
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:34,037
the key members that are geographically distributed

37
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,755
in touch not only with one another

38
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:37,410
but with the information base

39
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,284
with which they work all the time.

40
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:40,588
And this is obviously going to make

41
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,730
a tremendous difference in how we

42
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,672
plan, organize, and execute

43
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:48,257
almost everything of any intellectual consequence.

44
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,566
If we get into a mode in which

45
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:53,082
everything is handled electronically,

46
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:54,834
and your only identification

47
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,673
is some little plastic thing you stick into

48
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:58,463
the machinery, then I can image that

49
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:00,411
they want to get that settled up with

50
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,482
your bank account, just right now,

51
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,556
and put it through all the checks

52
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:05,844
and that would require a network.

53
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:08,715
Money transfers were just one of a growing number

54
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:11,127
of applications which required encryption

55
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:13,696
to remain secure, and as the Internet grew

56
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:16,112
to encompass millions around the world,

57
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,125
a new problem emerged.

58
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,262
At the time, encryption required

59
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:21,829
two parties to first share

60
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,604
a secret random number,

61
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,848
known as a key.

62
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,240
So how could two people

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,217
who have never met agree

64
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:30,530
on a secret shared key,

65
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,144
without letting Eve who was always listening

66
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,723
also obtain a copy?

67
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,006
In 1976 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman

68
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:44,093
devised an amazing trick to do this.

69
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:45,929
First, let's explore how this trick

70
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:48,338
is done using colors.

71
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,260
How could Alice and Bob agree on a

72
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,459
secret color without Eve

73
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,592
finding it out?

74
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,723
The trick is based on two facts.

75
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:59,055
One, it's easy to mix two colors

76
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,847
together to make a third color.

77
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,763
And, two, given a mixed color,

78
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:07,023
it's hard to reverse it in order to find

79
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,919
the exact original color.

80
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,418
This is the basis for a lock:

81
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:16,544
easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction.

82
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,995
This is known as a one-way function.

83
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:23,260
Now, the solution works as follows:

84
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,673
first, they agree publicly

85
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,563
on a starting color, say yellow.

86
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:33,244
Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select

87
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:36,142
private colors and mix them into

88
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,678
the public yellow in order to

89
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:40,547
disguise their private colors.

90
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:43,021
Now, Alice keeps her private color,

91
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,858
and sends her mixture to Bob.

92
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,465
And Bob keeps his private color

93
00:03:48,465 --> 00:03:52,015
and sends his mixture to Alice.

94
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:56,114
Now the heart of the trick.

95
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:58,559
Alice and Bob add their

96
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:00,916
private colors to the other person's

97
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,184
mixture, and arrive at a

98
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:07,125
shared secret color.

99
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,823
Notice how Eve is

100
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:13,074
unable to determine this exact color

101
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:15,246
since she needs one of their

102
00:04:15,246 --> 00:04:19,316
private colors to do so.

103
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,046
And that is the trick.

104
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,133
Now, to do this with numbers,

105
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,389
we need a numerical procedure,

106
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:29,278
which is easy in one direction,

107
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,153
and hard in the other.
