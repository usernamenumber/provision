1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:06,339
We humans like to get our heads around all of the complexity around us by classifying things,

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,937
and you can imagine there's no more obvious thing to classify

3
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:15,256
than all the living things around us, than all of the life that surrounds us

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:19,992
so what I want to start talking about is, how do we classify all of the life around us and this is more

5
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:25,612
often generally referred to as taxonomy, but the most basic question you have when you look at all of

6
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:31,277
the life around you, you start to see similarities between some of these living things. You see obviously

7
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:37,686
this this this thing right over here is more similar to the things that look like it than it does to

8
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:43,630
the grass behind it, or to that tree, and so we start saying oh maybe maybe I should group this thing

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,875
right over here into a group with other things like it and that's the very most building block of how we

10
00:00:50,875 --> 00:01:00,349
classify all of the living things around us, is putting them into buckets called species. So for example,

11
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:06,618
this is one particular animal, but we see other animals that seem to look like it so we say they're all

12
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:13,677
a part of a species of lions, and this animal its one animal and there's other animals that have stripes

13
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:18,692
but some might be fatter, or taller, or skinnier, or whatever else darker or lighter, but we say they're

14
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:24,637
similar enough that we call them all, we call them all tigers. We call all the animals even though they

15
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:29,699
might be a little bit bigger, skinnier, or fatter, lighter, or darker we call all of them that have this

16
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:35,364
kind of, they look similar to this thing right over here we'd call this, call this a donkey. We would

17
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:42,609
call this a donkey. We would call the things that we think are like this animal right here a horse. Now

18
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:47,299
that might seem like a straight, pretty straight forward way to think about it. Oh everything that looks

19
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,665
kind of like this character right here is a lion. Everything that looks kind of like this character right

20
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:58,027
here is a tiger, but that by itself is not a good enough definition for species. Things that look like

21
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:01,928
each other or things that act like each other, because what we will see is that there are some things

22
00:02:01,928 --> 00:02:07,547
that could be very different, at least in how they look or act that are actually closely related, and

23
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:11,355
then we will talk about what it means to be closely related, and then we can see things that look very

24
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:17,300
similar, that they have similar structures, they have similar behavior like for example bats and birds

25
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,197
but they're actually all very very distantly related, so we need a more exact definition for species than

26
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:29,002
just things that look like each other or just things that act like each other and so the most typical

27
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:40,009
definition for a species are animals, animals that can interbreed, that can interbreed interbreed and

28
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:46,278
when we say interbreed literally they can produce offspring with each other and and the offspring are

29
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:54,544
fertile, and offspring are fertile. Which means that the offspring can then have have further have babies,

30
00:02:54,544 --> 00:03:00,349
that they're not, they're not sterile. They're capable of breeding with other animals, and producing and

31
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,922
producing more offspring and to show an example of this this right here is a male lion, you find a male

32
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:12,610
lion and and a female lioness and most of the time they will be able to have offspring and the offspring

33
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:19,343
can go and mate with other lions or lionesses depending on their sex, and then they can have viable offspring

34
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:26,681
so it seems to work out pretty well for lions. Same thing is true of tigers. Now it does turn out that

35
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:36,944
if you get a male lion. If you have a male lion, and a female tigress they can breed. They can breed

36
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:43,956
and they can produce offspring, and their offspring which was made famous by napoleon dynamite. He was

37
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:49,204
kind of fascinated, these are kind of fascinating animals. Their offspring is called a liger. You get

38
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:55,706
a male lion breeding with the female tiger you produce a liger which is a hybrid a cross between a lion

39
00:03:55,706 --> 00:04:00,675
and a tiger, and they're fascinating animals actually larger than either lions or tigers. They're the

40
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:08,337
largest cats that we know off, but these ligers cannot be referred to as a separate species, or you can't

41
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:14,607
say that lions and tigers are the same species because even though they are able to interbreed their

42
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:23,221
offspring for the most part is not able is not fertile. is not able to produce offspring. There have been

43
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:27,749
one of stories of ligers being mated with either a lion or tiger but those are one off stories. In general

44
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:34,762
ligers can't interbreed, and in general this combination isn't going to produce offspring that can keep

45
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:41,403
interbreeding and are fertile. So that's why we say that lions and tigers are different species, and that

46
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:46,279
ligers we wouldn't even call it a species at all we would actually call it a hybrid between two species

47
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,434
now the same thing is true and actually you might be asking yourself well this was a male lion and a

48
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:56,800
female tigress what about if we went the other way around. What if we had a female lioness and a male

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,440
tiger? In that case you would produce something else called a Tiglon or a tigloon actually don't know

50
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,595
how to pronounce that and that is a a different hybrid that has slightly different properties than a liger.

51
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:17,068
S o I encourage you to look up what a tiglon is. Similarly you give me a male donkey, you give me a male

52
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,087
donkey and donkeys are clearly a species by themselves

53
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:25,103
because if you give me a male donkey and a female donkey they can reproduce, produce another donkey and

54
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:30,768
then that donkey can mate with other donkeys to produce more donkeys. So not only a donkey interbreed

55
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:36,620
with another donkey but that product that child donkey can then interbreed with can keep interbreeding

56
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,100
with other donkeys. Similarly horses they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, but if you give

57
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:53,802
me a male donkey and a female horse they can mate and they can produce a mule. they can produce a mule

58
00:05:53,802 --> 00:06:00,768
but once again like the ligers mules are not at least as far as I know, mules cannot, they're not fertile.

59
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:07,076
Mules cannot produce further offspring. They cannot interbreed with each other, and because even though

60
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:13,632
donkeys and horses can breed and produce mules their offspring aren't fertile we don't consider donkeys

61
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:21,016
and horses part of the same species, and we would consider mules like a liger or a tiglon, we would consider

62
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:26,728
them a hybrid. So these are all hybrids, what we would call a cross. In general the world hybrid is

63
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:32,069
used when you have two things, two different types that are somehow coming together, somehow having a

64
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,084
combination, and once again like the case with the tiglon you might say well what if I had a female donkey

65
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:42,750
what if I had a female donkey and a male horse, and then you would actually produce something called

66
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:50,273
a hinny, like called a hinny which similarly isn't as common as a mule and people like to use mules they're

67
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:55,428
actually very good work animals because they, they have some good properties of both donkeys and horses

68
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:00,629
hinnys are less common, but once again it is possible and they have different properties than mules,

69
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,599
and I do want to emphasize this idea because when we started of we just kind of tried to think oh well

70
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,057
how can we classify things and we said well hey maybe things that look and act similar should be called

71
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:14,933
species but i want to show you where maybe things that look and act different, we shouldn't call them

72
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:21,342
species. I want to show you a very typical case one that is really all around us all the time where this

73
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:27,611
definition animals that can interbreed and the offspring are fertile really does beseem to become much

74
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:33,927
much more important than just some notion of animals that look alike or animals that act the same and

75
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:40,103
the best example of that is with dogs. As I said this is a very typical species here because dogs and

76
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:48,648
I just took a sample of different types of breeds of dogs they can look very very different. Its obvious

77
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:55,103
look at the difference between these, for example this little chihuahua here and this dog right over

78
00:07:55,103 --> 00:08:00,630
here obviously they're size wise their look even the way they act are almost are much much more different much

79
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,113
than maybe how this donkey would act relative to this horse or how this lion would act relative to this

80
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:10,104
tigress and that they obviously look, they look very different. They're completely different sizes but

81
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:15,769
these two things actually can interbreed although with these two in particular seems like the mechanics

82
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:20,200
would get kind of difficult, but assuming they get over the mechanical hurdles they could interbreed and

83
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,611
produce fertile offspring same for these two characters. Same for these two characters over here, and

84
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:32,070
because of that even though all the different breeds of dogs and most of this is really due to human

85
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,085
doings trying to breed for particular, specific traits. Even though they look so different and act so

86
00:08:37,085 --> 99:59:59,999
different because they can interbreed and they can produce fertile offspring we consider all of these the same species.
