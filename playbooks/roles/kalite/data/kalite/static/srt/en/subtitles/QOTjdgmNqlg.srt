1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,090
Say I've got a subspace V.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:13,710
So V is some subspace,
maybe of Rn.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,180
I'm going to define the
orthogonal complement of V,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,040
let me write that
down, orthogonal

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,370
complement of V is the set.

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,905
And, this is shorthand notation
right here, would be

8
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,780
the orthogonal complement
of V.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,360
So we write this little
orthogonal notation as a

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,440
superscript on V.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,200
And you can pronounce this
as 'V perp', not for

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,770
'perpetrator' but for
'perpendicular.'

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:55,200
So V perp is equal to the set of
all x's, all the vectors x

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:06,440
that are a member of our Rn,
such that x dot V is equal to

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:17,230
0 for every vector V that is
a member of our subspace.

16
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,100
So we're essentially saying,
look, you have some subspace,

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,760
it's got a bunch of
vectors in it.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,240
Now if I can find some other
set of vectors where every

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,670
member of that set is orthogonal
to every member of

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,000
the subspace in question, then
the set of those vectors is

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,480
called the orthogonal
complement of V.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,520
And you write it this way,
V perp, right there.

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,670
So the first thing that we just
tend to do when we are

24
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,930
defining a space or defining
some set is to see, hey, is

25
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,950
this a subspace?

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,530
Is V perp, or the orthogonal
complement of

27
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,040
V, is this a subspace?

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,730
   

29
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,450
Well, you might remember from
many, many videos ago, that we

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,040
had just a couple of conditions
for a subspace.

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,600
That if-- let's say that a and b
are both a member of V perp,

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,620
then we have to wonder
whether a plus b is

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,750
a member of V perp.

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,710
That's our first condition.

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,470
It needs to be closed under
addition in order for this to

36
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,490
be a subspace.

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,390
And the next condition as well,
if a is a member of V

38
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:36,570
perp, is some scalar multiple of
a also a member of V perp?

39
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,920
And the last one, it has to
contain the zero vector.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,780
Which is a little bit redundant
with this, because

41
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,810
if any scalar multiple of a is
a member of our orthogonal

42
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,610
complement of V, you could
just multiply it by 0.

43
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,950
So it would imply that the zero
vector is a member of V.

44
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,740
So what does this imply?

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,670
What is the fact that a and
b are members of V perp?

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,170
That means that a dot V, where
this V is any member of our

47
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,360
original subspace V, is equal
to 0 for any V that is a

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,650
member of our subspace V.

49
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,122
And it also means that b, since
b is also a member of V

50
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:24,790
perp, that V dot any member of
our subspace is also going to

51
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:32,130
be 0, or any b that
is a member of V.

52
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,170
So what happens if we
take a plus b dot V?

53
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,330
Let's do that.

54
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,300
So if I do a plus b dot
V, what is this

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,100
going to be equal to?

56
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,860
This is going to be equal
to a dot V plus b dot V.

57
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,290
And we just said, the fact that
both a and b are members

58
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,210
of our orthogonal complement
means that both of these

59
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,970
quantities are going
to be equal to 0.

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,250
So this is going to be
equal to 0 plus 0

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,910
which is equal to 0.

62
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,860
So a plus b is definitely a
member of our orthogonal

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,440
complement.

64
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,620
So we got our check box right
there I'll do it in a

65
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,430
different color than
the question mark.

66
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,690
Check, for the first

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,950
condition, for being a subspace.

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,870
Now is ca a member of V perp?

69
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,959
Well let's just take c.

70
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,900
If we take ca and dot it with
any member of our original

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,740
subspace this is the same thing
as c times a dot V.

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,850
And what is this equal to?

73
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,000
By definition a was a member of
our orthogonal complement,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,230
so this is going to
be equal to 0.

75
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,750
So this is going to be c times
0, which is equal to 0.

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,830
So this is also a member
of our orthogonal

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,470
complement to V.

78
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,730
And of course, I can multiply
c times 0 and I

79
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,810
would get to 0.

80
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,250
Or you could just say, look, 0
is orthogonal to everything.

81
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,350
You take the zero vector, dot
it with anything, you're

82
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,270
going to get 0.

83
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,040
So the zero vector is always
going to be a member of any

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,250
orthogonal complement, because
it obviously is always going

85
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,570
to be true for this condition
right here.

86
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:16,920
So we know that V perp, or the
orthogonal complement of V, is

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,170
a subspace.

88
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,000
   

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,040
Which is nice because now we
can apply to it all of the

90
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,280
properties that we know
of subspaces.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,670
Now the next question, and I
touched on this in the last

92
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:40,260
video, I said that if I have
some matrix A, and lets just

93
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,820
say it's an m by n matrix.

94
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:53,540
In the last video I said that
the row space of A is -- well,

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,960
let me write this way.

96
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:03,510
I wrote that the null space of
A is equal to the orthogonal

97
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:25,570
complement of the
row space of A.

98
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,290
And the way that we can write
the row space of A, this thing

99
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,590
right here, the row space of
A, is the same thing as the

100
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,510
column space of A transpose.

101
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,180
So one way you can rewrite this
sentence right here, is

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,710
that the null space of A is the
orthogonal complement of

103
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,440
the row space.

104
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,830
The row space is the column
space of the transpose matrix.

105
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,810
And the claim, which I have
not proven to you, is that

106
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,580
this is the orthogonal
complement of this.

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,170
This is equal to that, the
little perpendicular

108
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,450
superscript.

109
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,770
That's the claim, and at least
in the particular example that

110
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,160
I did in the last two videos
this was the case, where I

111
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,580
actually showed you that
2 by 3 matrix.

112
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,436
But let's see if this
applies generally.

113
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:13,780
   

114
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,160
So let me write my matrix
A like this.

115
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,270
So my matrix A, I can
write it as just a

116
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,870
bunch of row vectors.

117
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:26,260
But just to be consistent with
our notation, with vectors we

118
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,240
tend to associate as column
vectors, so to represent the

119
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,060
row vectors here I'm just
going to write them as

120
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,530
transpose vectors.

121
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,630
Because in our reality, vectors
will always be column

122
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,520
vectors, and row vectors are
just transposes of those.

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,720
r1 transpose, r2 transpose and
you go all the way down.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,830
We have m rows.

125
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,300
So you're going to
get rm transpose.

126
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,530
Don't let the transpose
part confuse you.

127
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,690
I'm just saying that these
are row vectors.

128
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,310
I'm writing transposes there
just to say that, look these

129
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,710
are the transposes of
column vectors that

130
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,230
represent these rows.

131
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,530
But if it's helpful for you to
imagine them, just imagine

132
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,050
this is the first row of the
matrix, this is the second row

133
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,830
of that matrix, so
on and so forth.

134
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,750
Now, what is the null
space of A?

135
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,690
Well that's all of
the vectors here.

136
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,350
Let me do it like this.

137
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:31,660
The null space of A is all of
the vectors x that satisfy the

138
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,230
equation that this is going to
be equal to the zero vector.

139
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,610
Now to solve this equation,
what can we do?

140
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,980
We've seen this multiple
times.

141
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,340
This matrix-vector product is
essentially the same thing as

142
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:50,710
saying-- let me write it like
this-- it's going to be equal

143
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,970
to the zero vector in rm.

144
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,980
You're going to have m 0's all
the way down to the m'th 0.

145
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,640
So another way to write this
equation, you've seen it

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,540
before, is when you take the
matrix-vector product, you

147
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,550
essentially are taking
the dot product.

148
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,100
So to get to this entry right
here, this entry right here is

149
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,426
going to be this row dotted
with my vector x.

150
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:21,320
So this is r1, we're calling
this row vector r1 transpose.

151
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,640
This is the transpose of some
column vector that can

152
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,040
represent that row.

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,770
But that dot, dot my vector x,
this vector x is going to be

154
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,730
equal to that 0.

155
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,980
Now, if I take this guy-- let
me do it in a different

156
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,190
color-- if I take this guy and
I dot him with vector x, it's

157
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,190
going to be equal to that 0.

158
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:49,060
So r2 transpose dot x is
going to be equal to

159
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,440
that 0 right there.

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,960
   

161
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:05,470
So, another way to write this
equation is that r1 transpose

162
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:13,490
dot x is equal to 0, r2
transpose dot x is equal to 0,

163
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,950
all the way down to rn transpose
dot x is equal to 0.

164
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:28,070
And by definition the null space
of A is equal to all of

165
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:33,710
the x's that are members of--
well in this case it's an m by

166
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,250
n matrix, you're going to have
n columns-- so it's all the

167
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,730
x's that are members of rn, such
that Ax is equal to 0.

168
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,930
Or, you could alternately write
it this way: that if you

169
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,720
were to dot each of the rows
with x, you're going to be

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,830
equal to 0.

171
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,150
So you could write it
this way, such that

172
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,470
Ax is equal to 0.

173
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,190
That's an easier way
to write it.

174
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,220
So let's think about it.

175
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,110
If someone is a member, if
by definition I give

176
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,450
you some vector V.

177
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,950
   

178
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,590
If I were to tell you that
V is a member of the

179
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,280
null space of A.

180
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,370
Let's call it V1.

181
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,630
V1 is a member of
null space of A.

182
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,800
That means it satisfies this
equation right here.

183
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,410
That means A times
V is equal to 0.

184
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:30,610
A times V is equal to 0 means
that when you dot each of

185
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,070
these rows with V, you
get equal to 0.

186
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:42,740
Or another way of saying that
is that V1 is orthogonal to

187
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,060
all of these rows, to r1
transpose-- that's just the

188
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:55,100
first row-- r2 transpose, all
the way to rm transpose.

189
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,670
So this is orthogonal to all of
these guys, by definition,

190
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,530
any member of the null space.

191
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,880
Well, if you're orthogonal to
all of these members, all of

192
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,110
these rows in your matrix,
you're also orthogonal to any

193
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,630
linear combination of them.

194
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:25,340
   

195
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,000
You can imagine, let's say that
we have some vector that

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,830
is a linear combination of
these guys right here.

197
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:49,480
So let's say vector w is equal
to some linear combination of

198
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,280
these vectors right here.

199
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,590
I wrote them as transposes,
just

200
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,360
because they're row vectors.

201
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,885
But I can just write them as
regular column vectors, just

202
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:59,030
to show that w could be just
a regular column vector.

203
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:07,210
So let's say w is equal to c1
times r1, plus c2 times r2,

204
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,290
all the way to cm times rm.

205
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,800
That's what w is equal to.

206
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,383
So what happens when you take
V, which is a member of our

207
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:19,400
null space, and you
dot it with w?

208
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,750
So if you take V, and dot it
with w, it's going to be V

209
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,060
dotted with each of these guys,
because our dot product

210
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,370
has the distributive property.

211
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,630
So if you dot V with each of
these guys, it's going to be

212
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,750
equal to c1-- I'm just going
to take the scalar out-- c1

213
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:47,100
times V dot r1, plus c2 times V
dot r2-- this is an r right

214
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,130
here, not a V-- plus,
all the way to, plus

215
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,030
cm times V dot rm.

216
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,640
And we know, we already just
said, that V dot each of these

217
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,435
r's are going to
be equal to 0.

218
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:04,020
So all of these are going
to be equal to 0.

219
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,700
So this whole expression is
going to be equal to 0.

220
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,530
So if you have any vector that's
a linear combination of

221
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,700
these row vectors, if you dot
it with any member of your

222
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,590
null space, you're
going to get 0.

223
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,840
So let me write this way, what
is any vector that's any

224
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,630
linear combination
of these guys?

225
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,150
Well, that's the span
of these guys.

226
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,170
Or you could say that the row
space, that's the row space.

227
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,360
So if w is a member of the row
space, which you can just

228
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,920
represent as a column space of A
transpose, then we know that

229
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,250
V is a member of
our null space.

230
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,930
We know that V dot w is going
to be equal to 0, I just

231
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,490
showed that to you
right there.

232
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,390
So every member of our null
space is definitely orthogonal

233
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,210
to every member of
our row space.

234
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,240
So that's what we know so far.

235
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:17,030
Every member of null space of
A is orthogonal to every

236
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:27,970
member of the row space of A.

237
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,390
Now, that only gets
us halfway.

238
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,010
That still doesn't tell us that
this is equivalent to the

239
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,530
orthogonal complement
of the null space.

240
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,510
For example, there might be
members of our orthogonal

241
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,820
complement of the row space that
aren't a member of our

242
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,690
null space.

243
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:51,710
So let's say that I have
some other vector u.

244
00:15:51,710 --> 00:16:01,160
Let's say that u is a member of
the orthogonal complement

245
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,170
of our row space.

246
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,110
I know the notation is a little
convoluted, maybe I

247
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,080
should write an r there.

248
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,470
But I want to really get set
into your mind that the row

249
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,770
space is just the column
space of the transpose.

250
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,090
Let's say that u is some member
of our orthogonal

251
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,860
complement.

252
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,990
What I want to do is show
you that u has to be

253
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,750
in your null space.

254
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,990
And when I show you that,
then we know.

255
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,230
So far we just said that, OK
then, everything in the null

256
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,810
space is orthogonal to the row
space, but we don't know that

257
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,910
everything that's orthogonal
to the row space, which is

258
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,230
represented by this set,
is also going to be

259
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,970
in your null space.

260
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,235
That's what we have to show, in
order for those two sets to

261
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,230
be equivalent, in order
for the null space

262
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,520
to be equal to this.

263
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:49,990
So if we know this is true, then
this means that u dot w,

264
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:58,670
where w is a member of our
row space, is going

265
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,920
to be equal to 0.

266
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,950
   

267
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,700
Let me write this down right
here, that is going to be

268
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,030
equal to 0.

269
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,329
And what does that mean?

270
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:15,920
That means that u is
also orthogonal.

271
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,440
So this implies that u dot--
well, r, j, any of the row

272
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:32,330
vectors-- is also equal to 0,
where j is equal to 1, through

273
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,890
all the way through m.

274
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,090
How do I know that?

275
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,090
Well, I'm saying that look, you
take u as a member of the

276
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,850
orthogonal complement of the row
space, so that means u is

277
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,170
orthogonal to any member
of your row space.

278
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,960
So in particular the basis
vectors of your row space-- we

279
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,810
don't know whether all of these
guys are basis vectors--

280
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,380
these guys are definitely all
members of the row space.

281
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,990
Some of them are actually the
basis for the row space.

282
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,765
So that means if you take u dot
any of these guys, it's

283
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,910
going to be equal to 0.

284
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:06,240
So if u dot any of these guys is
equal to 0, that means that

285
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:20,240
u dot r1 is 0, u dot r2 is equal
to 0, all the way to u

286
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,460
dot rm is equal to 0.

287
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,990
Well, if all of this is true,
that means that A times the

288
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,280
vector u is equal to 0.

289
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,860
That implies this, right?

290
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,740
You stick u there, you take
all the dot products, it's

291
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,410
going to satisfy
this equation.

292
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,460
Which implies that u is a member
of our null space.

293
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,750
So we've just shown you that
every member of your null

294
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,020
space is definitely a member of
the orthogonal complement.

295
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,760
And now we've said that every
member of our orthogonal

296
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,900
complement is a member
of our null space.

297
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,590
   

298
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,955
And actually I just noticed
that I made a

299
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:54,785
slight error here.

300
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:57,260
This dot product, I don't have
to write the transpose here,

301
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,880
because we've defined our dot
product as the dot product of

302
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,630
column vectors.

303
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,680
So this is the transpose
of some column vectors.

304
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,390
So you can un-transpose
it here and just

305
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,250
take the dot product.

306
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,540
Anyway, minor error there.

307
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,130
But that diverts me from my main
takeaway, my punch line,

308
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,230
the big picture.

309
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,530
We now showed you, any member of
our null space is a member

310
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,740
of the orthogonal complement.

311
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,280
So we just showed you, this
first statement here is

312
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,710
another way of saying, any
member of the null space-- or

313
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,950
that the null space is a subset
of the orthogonal

314
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,310
complement of the row space.

315
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,570
So that's our row space, and
that's the orthogonal

316
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,140
complement of our row space.

317
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:42,360
And here we just showed that any
member of the orthogonal

318
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,040
complement of our row space
is also a member

319
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,900
of your null space.

320
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,390
Well, if these two guys are
subsets of each other, they

321
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,470
must be equal to each other.

322
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:59,060
So we now know that the null
space of A is equal to the

323
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,310
orthogonal complement of the row
space of A or the column

324
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,270
space of A transpose.

325
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,720
Now, I related the null space
with the row space.

326
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,000
I could just as easily make a
bit of a substitution here.

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,380
Let's say that A is
equal to some

328
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,900
other matrix, B transpose.

329
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,190
Right?

330
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,190
It's going to be the transpose
of some matrix, you could

331
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,620
transpose either way.

332
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,010
So if I just make that
substitution

333
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,220
here, what do we get?

334
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,200
We get, the null space of B
transpose is equal to the

335
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,380
column space of B transpose,
right?

336
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,560
A transpose is B transpose
transposed.

337
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,420
Let me get my parentheses
right.

338
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,400
And then that thing's orthogonal
complement.

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,510
So what is this equal to?

340
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,280
The transpose of the transpose
is just equal to B.

341
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:57,730
So I can write it as, the null
space of B transpose is equal

342
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:02,190
to the orthogonal complement
of the column space of B.

343
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,150
   

344
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:10,540
So just like this, we just show
that the left-- B and A

345
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,470
are just arbitrary matrices.

346
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,790
So this showed us that the null
space, sometimes it's

347
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:24,150
nice to write in words,
is the orthogonal

348
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:32,290
complement of row space.

349
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:42,260
And this right here is showing
us, that the left null space

350
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,090
which is just the same thing as
a null space of a transpose

351
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:50,840
matrix, is equal to,
orthogonal-- I'll just

352
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:58,610
shorthand it-- complement
of the column space.

353
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,460
Which are two pretty
neat takeaways.

354
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,310
We saw a particular example of
it a couple of videos ago, and

355
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,460
now you see that it's true
for all matrices.

356
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,200
