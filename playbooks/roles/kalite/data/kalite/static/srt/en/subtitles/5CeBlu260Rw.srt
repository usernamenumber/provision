1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,654
Which of the following names can be used to describe the geometric shape below?

2
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:13,608
So the first name in question is a quadrilateral, and a quadrilateral is literally any closed shape that has four sides,

3
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:20,775
and this is definitely a closed shape that has four sides so it is definitely a quadrilateral.

4
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:24,056
Next we have to think about whether it is a parallelogram.

5
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:32,027
A parallelogram is a quadrilateral that has two pairs of parallel sides where in each pair they are opposite sides.

6
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:37,928
And in this case if you look at this side over here it forms a ninety degree angle with this line,

7
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:42,159
and this side over here also forms a ninety degree angle with this line over here,

8
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,852
so these two sides, these two sides, are parallel.
