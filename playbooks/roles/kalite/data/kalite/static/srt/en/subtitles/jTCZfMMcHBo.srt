1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,750
Find the slope of the linear
function defined by the table.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,110
And they give us a table here.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,130
They define certain amount, I
guess these are shift lengths,

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,720
and then they say how many hours
is a half a day, is a

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,330
full day, is two days, is
a week, is a month.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,670
And then they tell us how much
money do we make in each of

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,940
those time periods.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,800
If we work four hours, we make
$54, if we work eight hours,

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,640
we make $108, so forth
and so on.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,880
And then they say what
does the slope

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,900
represent in this situation?

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,369
So we have to find the slope
and figure out what it

14
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,780
represents.

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,250
So just as a bit of review,
slope just equals the change

16
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,080
in the dependent variable
divided by the change in the

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
independent variable.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,330
So how much does a dependent
variable change for any amount

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,310
of change of the independent
variable?

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,240
In this situation, the dependent
variable is the

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,660
amount of money you make because
it is dependent on how

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,140
much time you work, this
is independent.

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,110
So let's call the independent
variable x, the dependent

24
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,860
variable y.

25
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,600
So our slope in this situation
would be change in y divided

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,170
by change in x.

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,510
   

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,530
So how much does the amount of
money I make change when I

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,560
work a certain number of hours,
when my hours worked

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,450
change by a certain amount.

31
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,640
So let's just take some
data points here.

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,780
We could take really any of
these data points, I'll take

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,740
some of the smaller numbers.

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,750
So let's say if when I go from
four to eight hours, so my

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,200
change in x is going
to be what?

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,330
If I go from four to eight,
might change in x is going to

37
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,660
be eight minus four,
four hours, right?

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,280
So this is going to
be my change in x.

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,070
I'm just picking these two
points, I could have picked

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,490
four and forty if I wanted, but
the math would become more

41
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,460
complicated.

42
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,620
But how much does the amount of
money earn change if I go

43
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,600
from four hours to
eight hours?

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,110
Well, I go from $54 to $108,
so the difference in the

45
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,730
amount of money I make
is $108 minus $54.

46
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,380
So what is my change in
my dependent variable?

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,630
Well, that's going to be $108
minus $54, that's just $54.

48
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,130
And then what was the
change in the

49
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,340
amount of hours I worked?

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,300
Well, the change in the hours
I worked was four hours.

51
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,940
So, if I work four more hours,
I make 54 more dollars.

52
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,840
Let me put a little
equal sign there.

53
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,860
So what is 54 divided by four?

54
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,780
So four goes into 54-- looks
like there's going to be

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,950
decimal here-- four goes
into five one time, one

56
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,560
times four is four.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,950
Subtract, you get five minus
four is one, bring down this

58
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,710
four you get 14.

59
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,220
Four goes into 14 three times,
three times four is 12.

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,880
Fourteen minus 12 is two, bring
down a 0 right here,

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,460
four goes into 20 five times.

62
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,900
And of course you have this
decimal right here.

63
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,890
Five times four is 20.

64
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,170
Subtract, no remainder.

65
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,050
So this is equal to 13.5, but
since we're talking in terms

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,530
of dollars, maybe say $13.50,
because that's

67
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,630
our numerator, right?

68
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,730
This is money earned, dollars
per hour, because that's our

69
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,260
denominator, dollars per hour.

70
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,040
So that essentially answers
our question.

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
What does the slope represent
in this situation?

72
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,050
It represents the hourly
wage for working at

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,570
wherever this might be.

74
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,160
Frankly, for this problem, you
didn't even have to take two

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,690
data points.

76
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,440
We could have said hey, if you
work four hours and make $54,

77
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,530
54 divided by four is 13.50.

78
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,080
Or we could have said hey, if
we work eight hours, we get

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,870
$108, 108 divided by
eight is 13.50.

80
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,670
So you didn't even have to take
two data points here, you

81
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,950
could have just taken any of
these numbers divided by any

82
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,860
of these numbers.

83
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,790
But hopefully we also
learned a little bit

84
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,260
about what slope is.

85
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,600
