1
00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:08,133
Based on the data below which student's score improved the most between the mid-term and final exam?

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:17,067
And so they give us this data in terms of a bar graph for each student.We actually have two bars that show the mid-term in blue and then final exam in red.

3
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:21,000
and they tell us that here,mid-term in blue,and final exam(in red)

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,400
-and sometimes this is called a two column bar graph,because for each student here,you have two columns

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,000
of data.So if you were to actually look at the data its self,you have the mid-term data and then the final

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,533
exam data.Now,they are asking us,"which student's score improved the most

7
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:43,133
between the mid-term and the final exams?"So,if we look at Jasmin right over here,might as well start with her since she

8
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:44,800
might as well start with her since she

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,933
is the most to the left.It looks like she definitely did improve from the mid-term to the final

10
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,667
It looks like the mid-term,if I had to guess,this looks like about

11
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:56,200
a,I don't know,looks like she got maybe a 72 or 73 on the mid-term,I'm just guessing.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,133
I don't know the exact number.And looks like on the final she got,I don't know

13
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:04,533
that looks like maybe a 77 or 78,approximately.So she improved a little bit about

14
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:09,000
5 points from the mid-term to the final.The way they have given us this information

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,067
we don't know the exact numbers, because it isn't super precise

16
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,933
in terms of marking off the bars.

17
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,333
Hopefully it will become obvious when we look through everyone's scores

18
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,467
Lets look at Jeff.

19
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:21,733
Jeff actually did WORSE from the mid-term to the final exam.

20
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:26,400
Looks like he got over an 85 on the mid-term,and then on the final

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
looks like he got,about an 84 or 85.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,733
So he actually went down.

23
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,733
So it is definately not Jeff.he definately did not improve the most

24
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:34,867
he actually went down.

25
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,800
Next,if you think about Nevin,

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,333
it looks like Nevin actually improved about the same ammount

27
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,800
as Jasmin.On both scores-I don't know if Nevin is a boy or a girl's name,

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,467
this person on both tests,this person did better than Jasmin.

29
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,533
But looks like the ACTUAL improvement is about the same.

30
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:56,000
Looks like they went from about an 83 to,I don't know,about an 88.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I am just estimating it,just trying to look at,look at this axis right

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,133
over there,and estimating what those scores are.

33
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:06,400
So Nevin and Jasmin right now, based on the three we have seen

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
are tied for the lead.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,133
Now lets look at Alejandra.

36
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:11,333
Now Alejandra-and this is,ok,this jumps out.

37
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,800
She definately improved,DRAMATICALLY,

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,533
from the mid-term, to the final exam.

39
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,400
Looks like on the mid-term,she maybe got an 81 or an 82.

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,467
So maybe this was an 82 she got on the mid-term,

41
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:26,933
and then on the final,looks like she got about a 95,a 95 on the final.

42
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,467
So this dramatic improvement.

43
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:31,333
So right now,Alejandra is the leading contender

44
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,733
for most improved,from the mid-term,to the final.

45
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,867
And then,finally, Marta,

46
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,800
right over here,

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,067
looks like,she actually got worse from the mid-term to the final.

48
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,400
She scored in the mid 90's on the mid-term,

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,933
and then LOW 90's in the final.

50
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,933
So she is definately not the most improved.

51
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,400
So the winner here is Alejandra.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Alejandra,is the most improved

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,800
between the mid-term,and the final exam.
