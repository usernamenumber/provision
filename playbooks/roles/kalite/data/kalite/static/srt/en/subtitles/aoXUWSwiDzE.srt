1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's do some practice problems
dealing with variable

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,190
expressions.

4
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,240
So these first problems say
write the following in a more

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,185
condensed form by leaving out
the multiplication symbol or

6
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,130
leaving out a multiplication
symbol.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,900
So here we have 2 times 11x, so
if we have 11 x's and then

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,100
we're going to have 2 times
those 11 x's, we're going to

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,970
have 22 x's.

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:32,400
So another way you could view
this, 2 times 11x, you could

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,960
view this as being equal to 2
times 11, and all of that

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
times x, and that's going
to be equal to 22 x's.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,065
You had 11 x's, you're going to
have 2 times as many x's,

14
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,500
so you're going to
have 22 x's.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,700
Let's see, you have
1.35 times y.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,510
Now here we're just going to do
a straight simplifying how

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,180
we write it.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,630
So 1.35 times y-- I'll do it
in a different color-- 1.35

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,720
times y-- that's a
little dot there.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,710
In algebra we can just get
rid of that dot symbol.

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,760
If we have a variable following
a number, we know

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,220
that means 1.35 times
that variable.

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,560
So that, we could rewrite as
just being equal to 1.35y.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,350
We've condensed it by
getting rid of the

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,360
multiplication sign.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,540
Let's see, here we
have 3 times 1/4.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, this is just straight
up multiplying a fraction.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,020
So in problem 3-- this was
problem 1, this is problem 2,

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,190
problem 3-- 3 times 1/4, that's
the same thing as 3

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,500
over 1 times 1/4.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,050
Multiply the numerators,
you get 3.

32
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,790
Multiply the denominators,
1 times 4, you get 4.

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,560
So number 3, I got 3/4.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,740
And then finally, you
have 1/4 times z.

35
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,650
We could do the exact same
thing we did up here in

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,030
problem number 2.

37
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,950
This was the same
thing as 1.35y.

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,130
That's the same thing
as 1.35 times y.

39
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,180
So down here we could rewrite
this as either being equal to

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:15,230
1/4z, or we could view this as
being equal to 1 over 4 times

41
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,260
z over 1, which is the same
thing as z times 1, over 4

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,980
times 1, or the same
thing as z over 4.

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,560
So all of these are
equivalent.

44
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Now, what do they want
us to do down here?

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,610
Evaluate the following
expressions for a is equal to

46
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:47,320
3, b is equal to 2, c is equal
to 5, and d is equal to minus

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,860
4-- or, actually, I should say
negative 4 is the correct

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,540
terminology.

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,160
Negative 4.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,110
So we just substitute.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,930
Every time we see an a, we're
going to put a minus 3 there,

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,660
or a negative 3 there.

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,410
Every time we see a b, we'll
put a positive 2 there.

54
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,180
Every time we see a c,
we'll put a 5 there.

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,750
And every time we see a d, we'll
put a minus 4 there.

56
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,710
And I'll do a couple of these.

57
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,540
I won't do all of them, just
for the sake of time.

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,240
So let's say problem number 5.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,640
They gave us 2 times
a plus 3 times b.

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,340
Well, this is the same thing as
2 times-- instead of an a,

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,340
we know that a is going to
be equal to negative 3.

62
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:36,930
So 2 times minus 3, plus
3 times b-- what's b?

63
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,960
They're telling us that b is
equal to 2-- so 3 times 2.

64
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,510
And what is this equal to?

65
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,840
2 times minus 3-- let me do it
in a different color-- 2 times

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,050
negative 3 is negative
6, plus 3 times 2.

67
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,580
3 times 2 is 6.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,230
That's positive 6.

69
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,180
So that is equal to 0.

70
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,390
And notice the order
of operations.

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,360
We did the multiplications, we
did the two multiplications

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
before we added the
two numbers.

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,510
Multiplication and division
takes precedence over addition

74
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,030
and subtraction.

75
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's do problem 6.

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,850
I'll do that right here.

77
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,320
So you have 4 times c.

78
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,180
4 times-- now what's
c equal to?

79
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,260
They tell us c is equal to 5.

80
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,080
So 4 times 5, that's
our c, plus d.

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,375
d is minus or negative 4.

82
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:39,090
So we have 4 times 5 is 20, plus
negative 4-- that's the

83
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,000
same thing as minus 4, so
that is equal to 16.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
Problem 6.

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,910
Now, let's do one of the
harder ones down here.

86
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,690
This problem 10 looks a little
bit more daunting.

87
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,650
Problem 10 right there.

88
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,395
So we have a minus 4b in the
numerator, if you can read it,

89
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:00,730
it's kind of small.

90
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,180
a is minus 3.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:09,570
So we have minus 3-- or negative
3-- minus 4 times b.

92
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,620
b is 2.

93
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,520
So 4 times 2.

94
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,240
Remember, this right here is
a, that right there is b.

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,940
How do I know?

96
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,730
They're telling me up here.

97
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,780
And then all of that over--
all of that is

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,670
over 3c plus 2d.

99
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:41,630
So 3 times-- what was c?
c is 5 plus 2 times d.

100
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,910
What is d?

101
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,350
d is negative 4.

102
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,070
   

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,550
So let's figure this out.

104
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,440
So we have to do order
of operations.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,310
Multiplication comes first
before addition and

106
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,560
subtraction.

107
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,910
   

108
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,900
So this is going to be equal
to minus 3 minus 4 times 2,

109
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,710
minus 8, all of that over-- 3
times 5 is 15, plus 2 times

110
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,590
negative 4 is negative 8,
or 15 plus negative

111
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,750
8 is 15 minus 8.

112
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,330
And now, the numerator becomes
negative 3 minus 8, which is

113
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,870
negative 11.

114
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,850
And the denominator is 15
minus 8, which is 7.

115
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,510
So problem 10, we simplified
it to negative 11 over 7.

116
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,920
Right there.

117
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,450
Let's do a couple of
these over here.

118
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,400
OK, we see some exponents.

119
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,350
I'll pick one of the
harder ones.

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:56,640
Let's do this one over
here, problem 18.

121
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,850
So 2x squared minus 3x squared,
plus 5x minus 4.

122
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,030
OK, well, this wasn't
that hard.

123
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,940
All of them are dealing
with x.

124
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,100
But what we could do here--
let me write this down.

125
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,680
2x squared minus 3x squared,
plus 5x minus 4.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,400
And they tell us that x is
equal to negative 1.

127
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,720
One thing we could do is
simplify this before we even

128
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,700
substitute for negative 1.

129
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,340
So what's 2 of something
minus 3 of something?

130
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,460
Right?

131
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,750
This is 2x squareds
minus 3x squareds.

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,780
So 2 of something minus 3 of
something, that's going to be

133
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,730
minus 1 of that something.

134
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,050
So that right there-- or
negative 1 of that something--

135
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,450
that would be negative 1x
squared plus 5x minus 4.

136
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,880
And they tell us x is
equal to negative 1.

137
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,220
So this is negative 1 times x
squared, negative 1 squared,

138
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,500
plus 5 times x, which is
negative 1, minus 4.

139
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,120
So what is this?

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,180
Negative 1 squared is just 1.

141
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,510
That's just 1.

142
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,780
So this whole expression
simplifies to negative 1 plus

143
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,140
5 times negative 1-- we do the

144
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,880
multiplication first, of course.

145
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,690
So that's minus 5, or
negative 5 minus 4.

146
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,840
So negative 1 minus 5 is
negative 6, minus 4 is equal

147
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,710
to negative 10.

148
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,369
And I'll do these last two just
to get a sample of all of

149
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:38,299
the types of problems in this
variable expression section.

150
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,380
The weekly cost, c, of
manufacturing x remote

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,050
controls-- so the cost is c, x
is the remote controls-- is

152
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,480
given by this formula.

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,260
The cost is equal to 2,000 plus
3 times the number of

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,840
remote controls, where cost
is given in dollars.

155
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,880
Question a, what is the
cost of producing

156
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,510
1,000 remote controls?

157
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,330
Well, the number of remote
controls is x.

158
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,010
So for part a-- I could write
it over here-- the cost is

159
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,090
going to be equal to-- just use
this formula-- 2,000 plus

160
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,840
3 times the number of
remote controls.

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,880
x is the number of
remote controls.

162
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,695
So 3 times 1,000.

163
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:28,430
So it's going to be equal to
2,000 plus 3 times 1,000 is

164
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,810
3,000, which is equal
to $5,000.

165
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,500
So that's part a. $5,000.

166
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,530
Now part b.

167
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,870
What is the cost of producing
2,000 remote controls?

168
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,450
Well, the cost-- just use the
same formula-- is equal to

169
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,330
2,000 plus 3 times the number
of remote controls.

170
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,350
So 3 times 2,000.

171
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:02,050
So that's equal to 2,000 plus
3 times 2,000 is 6,000.

172
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,900
So that's equal to $8,000.

173
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,770
Now we're at problem 22.

174
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,720
The volume of a box without a
lid is given by the formula,

175
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,240
volume is equal to 4x times 10
minus x squared, where x is a

176
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,700
length in inches, and v is the
volume in cubic inches.

177
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,700
What is the volume when
x is equal to 2?

178
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,570
So part a, x is equal to 2.

179
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,790
We just substitute 2 wherever
we see an x here.

180
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,170
So the volume is going to be
equal to 4 times x, which is

181
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:47,330
2, times 10 minus 2 squared.

182
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,980
And so this is going to be equal
to 4 times 2 is 8, times

183
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,950
10 minus 2 is 8 squared.

184
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,550
So that's 8 times-- so this
is equal to 8 times--

185
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,460
8 squared is 64.

186
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,000
You could say this is going to
be 8 to the third power.

187
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,380
And 64 times 8-- 4
times 8 is 32.

188
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:21,070
6 times 8 is 48, plus 3 is 51.

189
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:27,430
So it's 512.

190
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,500
Now, what is the volume
when x is equal to 3?

191
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,310
I'll do it here in pink. b, when
is equal to 3, then the

192
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,480
volume is equal to 4 times 3-- x
is equal to 3 now-- times 10

193
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,410
minus 3 squared.

194
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:52,230
4 times 3 is 12, times 10
minus 3 is 7 squared.

195
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,390
So it's equal to 12 times 49.

196
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,810
And just to get the exact
answer, let's multiply that.

197
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:05,740
So 49 times 12-- 2 times
9 is 18, 2 times 4 is

198
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,335
8, plus 1 is 9.

199
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,240
Put a 0.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,180
1 times 9 is 9.

201
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,630
1 times 4 is 4.

202
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,912
And then we add the two.

203
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:23,390
We get 8, 9 plus 9 is 18, and
then 1 plus 4 is 588.

204
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,066
