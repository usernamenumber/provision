1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,150
In this video, I want to tackle
some inequalities that

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,290
involve multiplying and dividing
by positive and

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,070
negative numbers, and you'll
see that it's a little bit

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,530
more tricky than just the adding
and subtracting numbers

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,540
that we saw in the last video.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,960
I also want to introduce you
to some other types of

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,905
notations for describing the
solution set of an inequality.

8
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:21,390
So let's do a couple
of examples.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,510
So let's say I had negative
0.5x is less

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,115
than or equal to 7.5.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,810
Now, if this was an equality,
your natural impulse is to

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,430
say, hey, let's divide both
sides by the coefficient on

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,670
the x term, and that is a
completely legitimate thing to

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,680
do: divide both sides
by negative 0.5.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,850
The important thing you need to
realize, though, when you

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,160
do it with an inequality is
that when you multiply or

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,920
divide both sides of the
equation by a negative number,

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,776
you swap the inequality.

19
00:00:57,776 --> 00:01:00,410
you swap the inequality

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,360
Think of it this way.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,210
I'll do a simple example here.

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,900
If I were to tell you that 1
is less than 2, I think you

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,600
would agree with that.

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,970
1 is definitely less than 2.

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,470
Now, what happens if I multiply
both sides of this by

26
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,700
negative 1?

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,930
Negative 1 versus negative 2?

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,700
Well, all of a sudden, negative
2 is more negative

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,730
than negative 1.

30
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,510
So here, negative 2 is actually
less than negative 1.

31
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,800
Now, this isn't a proof, but I
think it'll give you comfort

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,680
on why you're swapping
the sign.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,120
If something is larger, when you
take the negative of both

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,820
of it, it'll be more negative,
or vice versa.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,100
So that's why, if we're going to
multiply both sides of this

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,080
equation or divide both sides of
the equation by a negative

37
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,940
number, we need to
swap the sign.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,610
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation.

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,950
Dividing by 0.5 is the same
thing as multiplying by 2.

40
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,650
Our whole goal here is to have
a 1 coefficient there.

41
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,400
So let's multiply both
sides of this

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,830
equation by negative 2.

43
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:08,320
So we have negative 2
times negative 0.5.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,770
And you might say, hey, how
did Sal get this 2 here?

45
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,310
My brain is just thinking what
can I multiply negative

46
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,380
0.5 by to get 1?

47
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,230
And negative 0.5 is the same
thing as negative 1/2.

48
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,510
The inverse of that
is negative 2.

49
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,270
So I'm multiplying negative
2 times both

50
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,430
sides of this equation.

51
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,660
And I have the 7.5 on
the other side.

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,110
I'm going to multiply that
by negative 2 as well.

53
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,520
And remember, when you multiply
or divide both sides

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,330
of an inequality by a negative,
you swap the

55
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:37,690
inequality.

56
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,820
You had less than or equal?

57
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,790
Now it'll be greater
than or equal.

58
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,960
So the left-hand side,
negative 2 times

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,070
negative 0.5 is just 1.

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,450
You get x is greater than or
equal to 7.5 times negative 2.

61
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,670
That's negative 15, which
is our solution set.

62
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,190
All x's larger than negative 15
will satisfy this equation.

63
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,200
I challenge you to try it.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,610
For example, 0 will work.

65
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,460
0 is greater than negative 15.

66
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,710
But try something like--
try negative 16.

67
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,070
Negative 16 will not work.

68
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,820
Negative 16 times negative
0.5 is 8, which is

69
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,790
not less than 7.5.

70
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,470
So the solution set is all of
the x's-- let me draw a number

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,840
line here-- greater
than negative 15.

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,610
So that is negative 15 there,
maybe that's negative 16,

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,040
that's negative 14.

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:41,570
Greater than or equal to
negative 15 is the solution.

75
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,830
Now, you might also see solution
sets to inequalities

76
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,610
written in interval notation.

77
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,640
And interval notation, it
just takes a little

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,010
getting used to.

79
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,280
We want to include negative 15,
so our lower bound to our

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,780
interval is negative 15.

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,190
And putting in this bracket here
means that we're going to

82
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,530
include negative 15.

83
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,880
The set includes the
bottom boundary.

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,780
It includes negative 15.

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,963
And we're going to go all
the way to infinity.

86
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,500
All the way to infinity

87
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,110
And we put a parentheses here.

88
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,290
Parentheses normally means that
you're not including the

89
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,100
upper bound.

90
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,779
You also do it for infinity,
because infinity really isn't

91
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,850
a normal number, so to speak.

92
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,940
You can't just say, oh,
I'm at infinity.

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,540
You're never at infinity.

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,040
So that's why you put
that parentheses.

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,070
But the parentheses tends to
mean that you don't include

96
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,040
that boundary, but you also
use it with infinity.

97
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
So this and this are the
exact same thing.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,940
Sometimes you might also see
set notations, where the

99
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:48,630
solution of that, they might
say x is a real number such

100
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,650
that-- that little line, that
vertical line thing, just

101
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:58,070
means such that-- x is greater
than or equal to negative 15.

102
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,260
These curly brackets mean the
set of all real numbers, or

103
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,320
the set of all numbers, where x
is a real number, such that

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,430
x is greater than or equal
to negative 15.

105
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,390
All of this, this, and this
are all equivalent.

106
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,610
Let's keep that in mind and do
a couple of more examples.

107
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:25,400
So let's say we had 75x is
greater than or equal to 125.

108
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,030
So here we can just divide
both sides by 75.

109
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,020
And since 75 is a positive
number, you don't have to

110
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,620
change the inequality.

111
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,070
So you get x is greater than
or equal to 125/75.

112
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,240
And if you divide the numerator
and denominator by

113
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,440
25, this is 5/3.

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,950
So x is greater than
or equal to 5/3.

115
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,220
Or we could write the solution
set being from including 5/3

116
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,380
to infinity.

117
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,230
And once again, if you were
to graph it on a number

118
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,630
line, 5/3 is what?

119
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,650
That's 1 and 2/3.

120
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,940
So you have 0, 1, 2, and
1 and 2/3 will be

121
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,660
right around there.

122
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,200
We're going to include it.

123
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,320
That right there is 5/3.

124
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,960
And everything greater than or
equal to that will be included

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,970
in our solution set.

126
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,850
Let's do another one.

127
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:33,170
Let's say we have x over
negative 3 is greater than

128
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,900
negative 10/9.

129
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,720
So we want to just isolate the
x on the left-hand side.

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,990
So let's multiply both sides
by negative 3, right?

131
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,770
The coefficient, you could
imagine, is negative 1/3, so

132
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,360
we want to multiply by the
inverse, which should be

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,700
negative 3.

134
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,590
So if you multiply both sides
by negative 3, you get

135
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,940
negative 3 times-- this you
could rewrite it as negative

136
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,000
1/3x, and on this side, you
have negative 10/9 times

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,220
negative 3.

138
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,350
And the inequality will
switch, because we are

139
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,330
multiplying or dividing
by a negative number.

140
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,980
So the inequality will switch.

141
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,940
It'll go from greater
than to less than.

142
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,630
So the left-hand side of the
equation just becomes an x.

143
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,540
That was the whole point.

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,810
That cancels out with that.

145
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,870
The negatives cancel out.
x is less than.

146
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,480
And then you have a negative
times a negative.

147
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,260
That will make it a positive.

148
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,010
Then if you divide the numerator
and the denominator

149
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:41,430
by 3, you get a 1 and a 3,
so x is less than 10/3.

150
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,630
So if we were to write this
in interval notation, the

151
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,900
solution set will-- the upper
bound will be 10/3 and it

152
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,290
won't include 10/3.

153
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,270
This isn't less than or equal
to, so we're going to put a

154
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,870
parentheses here.

155
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,390
Notice, here it included 5/3.

156
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,180
We put a bracket.

157
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,760
Here, we're not including
10/3.

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,240
We put a parentheses.

159
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,560
It'll go from 10/3, all the way
down to negative infinity.

160
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,850
Everything less than 10/3
is in our solution set.

161
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,640
And let's draw that.

162
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,170
Let's draw the solution set.

163
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,560
So 10/3, so we might
have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

164
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,340
10/3 is 3 and 1/3, so it might
sit-- let me do it in a

165
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,840
different color.

166
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,440
It might be over here.

167
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,410
We're not going to
include that.

168
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,690
It's less than 10/3.

169
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,120
10/3 is not in the
solution set.

170
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,150
That is 10/3 right there, and
everything less than that, but

171
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,169
not including 10/3, is
in our solution set.

172
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,720
Let's do one more.

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,350
Let's do one more.

174
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:54,430
Say we have x over negative
15 is less than 8.

175
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,820
So once again, let's multiply
both sides of this equation by

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,520
negative 15.

177
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,700
So negative 15 times
x over negative 15.

178
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,880
Then you have an 8 times
a negative 15.

179
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,640
And when you multiply both sides
of an inequality by a

180
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,300
negative number or divide both
sides by a negative number,

181
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,730
you swap the inequality.

182
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,960
It's less than, you change
it to greater than.

183
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,260
And now, this left-hand side
just becomes an x, because

184
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,955
these guys cancel out.

185
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:28,860
x is greater than 8 times 15
is 80 plus 40 is 120, so

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,010
negative 120.

187
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,640
Is that right?

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,270
80 plus 40.

189
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,810
Yep, negative 120.

190
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,330
Or we could write the solution
set as starting at negative

191
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,090
120-- but we're not including
negative 120.

192
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,450
We don't have an equal
sign here-- going all

193
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,690
the way up to infinity.

194
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,280
And if we were to graph
it, let me draw

195
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,290
the number line here.

196
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,280
I'll do a real quick one.

197
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,720
Let's say that that
is negative 120.

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,170
Maybe zero is sitting up here.

199
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,240
This would be negative 121.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,110
This would be negative 119.

201
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,670
We are not going to include
negative 120, because we don't

202
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,470
have an equal sign there, but
it's going to be everything

203
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,280
greater than negative 120.

204
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,970
All of these things that I'm
shading in green would satisfy

205
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,660
the inequality.

206
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,510
And you can even try it out.

207
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,860
Does zero work?

208
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,980
0/15?

209
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,820
Yeah, that's zero.

210
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,250
That's definitely less than 8.

211
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,020
I mean, that doesn't prove it to
you, but you could try any

212
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,750
of these numbers and
they should work.

213
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,470
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that helpful.

214
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,820
I'll see you in the
next video.
