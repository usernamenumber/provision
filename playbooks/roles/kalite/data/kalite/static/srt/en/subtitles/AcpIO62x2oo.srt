1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,625
Find the sum of -15 + (-46) + (-29)

2
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:08,471
To do this, let's just first visualize

3
00:00:08,471 --> 00:00:10,115
what each of these numbers look like.

4
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:12,497
So I'm going to draw a number line for each of them.

5
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:15,649
-15 might look something like this.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:21,031
If this is 0, and let's say this is -15.

7
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:28,087
I can represent -15 as an arrow that points from 0 to -15.

8
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:31,698
The length of the arrow is the absolute value of this.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,344
It's the distance from 0.

10
00:00:33,344 --> 00:00:36,129
So the length here is 15

11
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,254
and the negative says we are pointing to the left.

12
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:42,070
So the absolute value is 15.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,647
That's the length of that arrow.

14
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:45,645
Let's do the same thing for -46.

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:53,044
Once again let me draw my number line.

16
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:55,580
Put 0 is going to be right over there.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,924
and -46 is going to be someplace over here.

18
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:02,154
Notice the same exact idea

19
00:01:02,154 --> 00:01:04,564
The distance between -46 and 0

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,477
or another way to think that is the absolute value of -46.

21
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:14,867
This distance right over here is going to be 46.

22
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,569
And its direction is to the left.

23
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:21,549
That's why we get to the number -46.

24
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:22,454
The negative really tells you

25
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:25,491
wether you're to the left or the right of 0.

26
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:26,745
The absolute value says

27
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:30,193
how far you are to the left or the right of 0.

28
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:35,656
Finally let me do the same thing for -29.

29
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:40,596
So once again, let me draw my number line.

30
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:42,579
Use the yellow again.

31
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:45,032
So got to draw my number line.

32
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:50,359
Say this is 0, -29 is going to be roughly over here.

33
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,953
Once again -29 is exactly 29 away from 0.

34
00:01:54,953 --> 00:02:00,267
So this length right over here is 29 and it is to the left

35
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,099
that is why it is -29.

36
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,043
If it was +29, it would be 29 to the right of 0.

37
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,359
So we have represented all of these numbers

38
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,502
and you can see what their absolute values are like.

39
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:12,111
And now let's think what happens if you add them.

40
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,194
One way to think about adding these numbers

41
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:16,165
is as if you added these arrows.

42
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,433
If you put this arrow on top of this arrow

43
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:20,886
or to the left of this arrow

44
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:23,551
If you started with this arrow leaves off,

45
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,273
then you put this green arrow.

46
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:26,517
And then you put the orange arrow.

47
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:32,569
So let's do that. Let's draw that.

48
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,444
It's going to be a longer arrow now.

49
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,143
So we are going to start at 0.

50
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:38,118
First we have -15.

51
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:42,052
So we are going to move 15 spaces to the left,

52
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:46,733
to get us to -15.

53
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,982
Then we are going to go 46 spaces to the left,

54
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:53,595
to get us to -15 + (-46)

55
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:58,716
Let me draw that. Then we are going to go...

56
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,318
We are going to figure out what that number is in a second.

57
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,596
Then we're going to go 46 to the left. That's about that far.

58
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:08,662
It's really just this arrow. I am now placing it.

59
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:11,333
I am starting off where the -15 started

60
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,608
or where the -15 left off.

61
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:15,723
and then I am putting that arrow after that.

62
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:18,485
And we don't know yet what number this gets us to.

63
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:19,713
We are going to have to do a little math here.

64
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,299
That's actually the point of this problem.

65
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,195
But we know the length of this arrow is 46.

66
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:27,271
It is 46 to the left.

67
00:03:27,271 --> 00:03:30,662
We know the length of this magenta arrow is 15.

68
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:34,257
Then finally we have this orange arrow

69
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,105
which we know has a length of 29,

70
00:03:36,105 --> 00:03:37,965
although it's 29 to the left.

71
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:39,035
It looks like that.

72
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:41,050
It has a length of 29.

73
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,308
So when all is said and done, where are we?

74
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,831
Where do we end up on our number line?

75
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,733
Well, the total length that we are to the left,

76
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,316
is going to be 15+46+29.

77
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,072
But it's going to be to the left.

78
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,454
So it's going to be negative.

79
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,212
So we can really view this as

80
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:58,835
Since all of these have the same sign

81
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,776
Look this is the same thing

82
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:09,474
as abs(-15)+abs(-46)+abs(-29)

83
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:11,726
But then take the negative value of it.

84
00:04:11,726 --> 00:04:12,557
Let's just add that.

85
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:23,849
15+46+29 is equal to...let's see.

86
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,215
5+6 is 11. 11+9 is 20. Carry the 2.

87
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:33,643
2+1 is 3. 3+4 is 7. 7+2 is 9. So you get 90.

88
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:37,464
So this entire length here is 90.

89
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,026
If you add up the arrows, you get a 90.

90
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:42,605
But it is not 90 to the right.

91
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,855
If it was 90 to the right, this would all be positive.

92
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,581
Then we'll just get positive 90.

93
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,067
But this is 90 to the left.

94
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,998
So when you add these guys up,

95
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,981
you don't get to positive 90.

96
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,102
You get to negative 90.

97
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:57,133
So one way to think about it is, these are all the same sign.

98
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,718
So this is going to be equal to

99
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:12,651
the -( abs(-15)+abs(-46)+abs(-29))

100
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:14,400
and the reason why we are writing this.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,977
this might look fancy

102
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:21,573
but this is really just the length of this purple arrow.

103
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:23,623
This absolute value of 46,

104
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,401
that's really just the length of the green arrow, 46.

105
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:32,093
This is just the length of the orange arrow.

106
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:35,600
So this is 15+46+29, gives us 90.

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,918
But it's to the left. So that is why it is -90.
