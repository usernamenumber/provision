1
00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:05,569
oxidation state-indicate the general distribution of electrons

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,301
another name for oxidation states is oxidation numbers and

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,853
of course,this concept is covered in general chemstry

4
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:22,972
a lot,I'm gonna start,I would the general chemistry way of assigning oxidation states,and then i'm gonna go into a more organic way of assigning oxidation states

5
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:28,304
and the way that's most useful when you are dealing with organic molecules,and the thing that a lot of people

6
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:31,974
mess about oxidation states,is that electronegti-

7
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:35,438
vity is involved ,so I'll show you some examples of that

8
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:39,941
other difinitions from general chemistry,the concept of oxidation

9
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:43,772
is an increase in the oxidation state of

10
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:47,101
an element,and the other definition that's covered

11
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,849
a lot in general chemistry is loss of electrons

12
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:54,043
is oxidation,so LEO is an acronym for that

13
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:58,772
another definition is reduction,which is a decrease

14
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:02,703
or reduction in the oxidation state of sth,and

15
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:06,706
GER stands for"gain of electrons" is reduction,so

16
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:10,767
LEO the Lion goes GER is one of those things that all general chemistry students

17
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:14,569
have heard before.Here we have,um,a reaction

18
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,603
where methane is being combusted,and the products

19
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:22,237
are CO2 and water.Let's assign oxidation states

20
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:26,348
using the general chemistry way,and we'll see what is oxidized

21
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:30,369
and what is reduced,and then we will use the organic way

22
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:34,305
to assign oxidation states using the concept of electronegativity

23
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:38,702
and dot structures.So,first we'll do it the way that you memorize

24
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,271
you have all these rules for assigning oxidation states

25
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:45,106
and one of those rules is hydrogen is usually

26
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:49,577
plus1,so go ahead and put a plus one oxidation state

27
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,435
here for hydrogen.I have four of them so I am gonna put a total of plus 4

28
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:57,438
down here.Another rule for assigning oxidation states is that

29
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,502
for a neutral molecule,they total has to add up to equal zero

30
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:05,106
so,this would be-4 over here on the carbon side

31
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:09,574
and I have only one carbon,so carbon's oxidation state is -4

32
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:13,522
I move over here to oxygen.I ignore the coefficient and

33
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:16,772
I'm only focused in the fact of this is O2 here,and one of your rules

34
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:20,232
for assigning oxidation states is for an element in its elemental state

35
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:24,835
it has an oxidation state of zero,so oxygen

36
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:28,523
has an oxidation state of zero which we just memorize.Move over here

37
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,685
now we have oxygen in a molecule with carbon

38
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,373
and in this case,oxygen is going to have an oxidation state

39
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:40,302
of -2.Again,just one of those rules that we memorize,so I have

40
00:02:40,302 --> 00:02:44,036
two oxygens ,so I get a total of -4 over here,which must mean

41
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:50,236
that this carbon's oxidation state is +4

42
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,100
I go over here to water

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,836
I always start on the right here ,so once again oxygen is going to have

44
00:02:55,836 --> 00:03:00,021
an oxidation state of -2,only have one of them

45
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:03,702
and so,again,I'm ignoring the coefficient,so my total has to be plus

46
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:07,855
2 over here,and this time I actually have 2hydrogens,so 2 hydrogens have to add

47
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:12,019
up to +2,so each hydrogen is+1 like that.Now when we take

48
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,841
a look at what happen to these elements,um.I look

49
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:20,931
at carbon,and I see that carbon went from an oxidation state of -4

50
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:24,767
to an oxidation state of +4,so obviously

51
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,503
that's an increase in the oxidation state of carbon

52
00:03:27,503 --> 00:03:32,270
so we say that carbon was oxidized

53
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:40,101
what was reduced,well,reduction is a decrease or a reduction in the oxidation state

54
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:43,704
so all I have to do is look at my numbers and see which one went down

55
00:03:43,704 --> 00:03:47,851
oxygen went from an oxidation state of zero to an

56
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:53,692
oxidation state of -2,so oxygen was reduced in this reaction

57
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,015
so that's the general chemistry way of doing it.Let's look at

58
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:00,849
the more organic way of doing it using dot structures and

59
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:06,369
electronegativity,so let's go ahead and draw some dot structures for these molecules

60
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,850
so we start off with methane over here,so methane has a

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,702
very simple dot structure and

62
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:17,909
let's go ahead and indicate the electrons in methane,so

63
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:26,025
we have each one of our bonds consist of two electrons like that

64
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,018
OK,so

65
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:31,772
let's think about which atom is more electronegative

66
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:36,036
so we have carbon vs hydrogen,and if you remember your trends for electro-

67
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:40,177
negativity,carbon is going to be more electronegative than hydrogen

68
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:43,101
so what we are going to do is treat this like its an ionic bond

69
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:47,852
even though its technically a covalent bond,so if this were an ionic

70
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:52,859
bond,carbon being much more electronegative is going to steal all those electrons

71
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:58,703
so let's draw another picture showing carbon stealing all those electrons,so now carbon

72
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:03,604
is going to have a total of eight electrons around it,because it is going to steal

73
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:08,973
all electrons in those bonds with hydrogen,and hydrogen is gonna sit all alone over here

74
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:16,108
with no electrons around,since it's not as electronegative as carbon,so if we were to

75
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,041
assign an oxidation state

76
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:22,105
to this carbon,the formula we would use is we would say

77
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:28,904
to figure out the oxidation state,we would say what is the number of valence electrons

78
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:31,302
that are normally,um,around

79
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:35,908
an atom,and from that number,we are going to subtract the number of

80
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:42,441
electrons around the atom

81
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,969
after we've accounted for

82
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,369
electronegativity after we thought about the electr-

83
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:53,077
onegativity of the atoms,so that would be our second picture down here

84
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:57,039
that would be the one with carbon with eight electrons around it.Well,carbon

85
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,902
normally has four valence electrons so we spend a lot of time talking

86
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,987
about that earlier,so carbon has 4 valence electrons

87
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:07,840
let's go ahead and write her oxidation state,so number of electrons minus

88
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,636
electrons around the atom,so carbon normally has 4,from that

89
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,170
number we're going to subtract the number of electrons around

90
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,438
the atom after we count for the electronegativity,well,that would be these 8 electrons

91
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:22,995
right here,so 4-8is going to give us an oxidation state

92
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:28,772
of -4 for carbon.What about for hydrogen,well,hydrogen normally has

93
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:32,662
1 valence electron around it,and how many electrons around each one

94
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,042
of our hydrogens here

95
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,775
0 of course,so 1-0,and this is going to be

96
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:41,775
+1,so we have an oxidation state of -4 for carbon and oxidation state of +1 for hydrogen
