1
00:00:02,082 --> 00:00:04,008
So we often talk about capillary beds,

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,196
but I thought that it would be fun to get really up close

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:09,234
and really get a good understanding of how these things work.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,241
Couple of neat freaks(?) our body has developed

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:14,671
to make sure that blood gets to the areas

6
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,730
where it needs to go.

7
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,273
So let's start up on the left side.

8
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,824
This is an arterial, right.

9
00:00:19,825 --> 00:00:23,532
So an arterial is carrying blood that

10
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:25,416
initially came from the heart.

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,415
It's gonna come down --let's say, this way,

12
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:28,857
through the arterial,

13
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:30,564
and let's say some of the blood

14
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,184
is gonna continue down this way,

15
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:33,501
maybe to another capillary bed.

16
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,194
But, here we have one right here.

17
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:36,868
So, it's gonna divert and send

18
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:38,899
some of the blood through this way.

19
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,687
Now, the first vessels,

20
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:42,140
this tiny little vessel over here,

21
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,320
it actually is not a capillary,

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,286
eventhough we would assume it's a capillary,

23
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:48,943
'cause it's coming after the arteriola,

24
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:52,441
we call it a metarteriole,
a [metarteriole].

25
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,002
And the reason I'm calling it that,

26
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:57,095
is because if you look inside the wall of this metarteriole,

27
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,574
it actually has some smooth muscle.

28
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:01,675
And so this by definition then,

29
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:03,588
not a true capillary,

30
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:06,316
because it has some smooth muscle in the wall.

31
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,234
The true capillaries are these guys out here.

32
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,716
So, all these guys over here,

33
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:13,382
these are the true capillaries.

34
00:01:13,382 --> 00:01:15,396
Let me actually-- just gonna call them that.

35
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:17,871
So when we use the word [true capillary],

36
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:21,775
we're really trying to distinguish form that metarteriole.

37
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,632
So where is the blood gonna go?

38
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:26,843
It's gonna go into all these true capillaries, right.

39
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:29,208
It's course all the way through here.

40
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,511
It's gonna go every which ways,

41
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,068
gonna go down this way as well,

42
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,885
into all these two capillaries.

43
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:39,401
And it's basically trying to get to all the tissues, all the cells here.

44
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,881
These are individual cells, kinda hanging out,

45
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:45,674
all doing their job, and they need --of course-- nutrition.

46
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:48,190
So this is at the sailevel(?) level,

47
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,430
this is what it looks like, guys.

48
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,036
Just a bunch of cells, put together,

49
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,640
trying to get some nutrition,

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,218
and when you kinda zoom out,

51
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:56,867
you'd say, 'ah, what this is?'

52
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,745
obviously, a bit of tissue.

53
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,606
So we talk about tissue,

54
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:03,199
is basically just talking about collection of cells like this.

55
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,380
I'm not gonna draw them, but you get the idea.

56
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,137
And some of the blood, of course, is gonna go

57
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,452
and stay in this metateriole,

58
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:10,913
it's gonna go through the other side.

59
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,622
And it goes to the other side, the name changes.

60
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:17,383
So, same basic vessel in a way,

61
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:19,140
but its name changes.

62
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,325
And it's called the [thoroughfare channel].

63
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:25,448
So the thoroughfare channel.

64
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:30,572
And the distinction between the thoroughfare channel and the metarteriole,

65
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:35,192
is that the thoroughfare channel does not have smooth muscle.

66
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,757
So here you should not be finding any smooth muscle.

67
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,174
That's really the key difference between the two sides.

68
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:43,513
So this is really becoming more like a venule.

69
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,822
So over here as the blood kinda exits,

70
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,507
and goes back towards the heart,

71
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,985
and of course it's gonna meet up with other blood coming back,

72
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:52,777
this is the venule, or the vein side.

73
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:55,766
So now you can kind of see how the blood flowing

74
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,722
from the arteriole all the way to the venule.

75
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:00,103
Now, here's the really cool thing.

76
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:03,732
What the body does --this is the nifty concept--

77
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:07,972
is that there're these pre-capillary sphincters.

78
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,847
[pre-capillary sphincters]

79
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:12,371
Now I've drawn them as yellow -kinda- cells here.

80
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,517
Smooth muscle cells.

81
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,485
And these pre-capillary sphincters,

82
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:18,957
what they do is they basically squeeze down.

83
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,784
They basically squeeze down.

84
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:24,561
That's these guys I've drawn --I think six sets of them--

85
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:27,459
but you can see that all basically looking the same.

86
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,400
They will squeeze down.

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,510
And if they do, let's say-

88
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,388
we do not want blood to come to this capillary bed,

89
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,850
we wanna save the blood for something else.

90
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,038
Well, these smooth muscle pre-capillary sphincters,

91
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,963
they squeeze down, and as the result,

92
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,612
you really don't get any blood flow going through these areas.

93
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:47,701
So these white arrows --they kind of do not exist.

94
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:50,277
Yeah, the last(?) blood going this way.

95
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:54,229
And all(?) the blood will end up just going right trough the middle.

96
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,750
It'll just go right through that metarteriole,

97
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,337
right through here.

98
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:02,279
And it'll go into the thoroughfare channel.

99
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,883
So basically what you're doing is,

100
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:06,056
you're basically completely avoiding this capillary bed,

101
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:10,394
by clamping down on these pre-capillary sphincters.

102
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:13,659
So it's kind of neat use of smooth muscle,

103
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:17,980
to control even at the capillary bed level,

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,534
where the blood is flowing.
