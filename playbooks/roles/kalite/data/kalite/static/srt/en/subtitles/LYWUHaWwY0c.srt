1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,160
Here's another problem that
Kortaggio sent me and,

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,030
like the other two, this
is quite interesting.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,550
Although, I think you'll start
to see a pattern forming

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,500
in how these are solved.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,880
And that's the whole point, not
just to show you neat problems,

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,240
but also to give you an
intuition of how to solve it.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,200
So what does it say?

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,470
It says Alice is 100 meters
from Bill and Bill is 300

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,020
meters away from Chelsea.

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,910
Maybe this is a bit of a
Clintonian reference, but who

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,660
knows, or maybe they just
wanted people with starting

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,350
names a, b, and c.

14
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,750
So let's draw that out.

15
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,520
So Alice is 100 meters
from Bill-- all right.

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,830
Alice is 100 meters from Bill--
and actually he drew a little

17
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,450
diagram, so we know that also
Chelsea is to the

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,280
right of Bill.

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,415
So let's see, the diagram he
sent me looks like this.

20
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,830
So you have Alice.

21
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,940
And then 100 meters
away you have Bill.

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,450
And then 300 meters to the
right of that you have Chelsea.

23
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:00,820
This distance right
here is 100 meters.

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,510
And then this distance
right there is 300 meters.

25
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,460
And the problem tells us they
are all facing east and are

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,030
standing on the same line.

27
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,600
Fair enough.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,960
We'll say that's east.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,690
So they're all facing in
that direction standing

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,650
in the same line.

31
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,890
They all travel to the
east at constant speeds.

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,220
OK, but they don't say that
they're all traveling

33
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,175
at the same speed.

34
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:27,810
Each individual
speed is constant.

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,815
So this could be velocity of
Alice, lowercase a, velocity

36
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:38,210
of Bill, and then this is
the velocity of Chelsea.

37
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,820
Alright, they all travel
east at constant speeds.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,940
In 6 minutes, Alice
overtakes Bill.

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,980
So what has to happen?

40
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,390
Let me do this in another color
and write down what that

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,310
equation would look like.

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,630
So I'll do it in green.

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,700
In 6 minutes, Alice
overtakes Bill.

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,290
This tells the distance that
Alice travels in 6 minutes.

45
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,890
So what's the distance that
Alice travels in 6 minutes?

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,350
It would be the velocity
of Alice times 6.

47
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,170
And she overtakes Bill.

48
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,430
So that means she goes 100
meters more than Bill went.

49
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,290
So that means she went 100
meters plus the distance that

50
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,790
Bill went in that 6 minutes.

51
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,700
And the distance that Bill
went in 6 minutes is

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,380
velocity of Bill times 6.

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,960
Right?

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,810
This tell us in 6 minutes,
Alice went 100 meters more

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,260
than however far Bill
went in 6 minutes.

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,310
That's that equation there.

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,270
We got it from
this information.

58
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,480
And then the next thing,
this problem tells us, in

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,830
another 6 minutes Alice
overtakes Chelsea.

60
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,200
So from the beginning of
our time, it essentially

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,190
takes 12 minutes.

62
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,730
Right?

63
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,070
6 minutes to overtake Bill
and then another 6 minutes

64
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,910
to overtake Chelsea.

65
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,080
So 12 minutes to
overtake Chelsea.

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,620
So we could write that as the
distance that Alice travels

67
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,950
in 12 minutes is equal to--

68
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,450
Well, she has to
overtake Chelsea.

69
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,340
That means she made up 400
meters of distance, so that

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,560
she traveled 400 more meters.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,870
So the distance that Alice
travels is going to be 400

72
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,260
meters more than the distance
that Chelsea travels

73
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,300
in 12 minutes.

74
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,990
And remember, distance is just
equal to rate times time.

75
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,280
Right?

76
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,400
So in 12 minutes this is how
far-- oh sorry --this is how

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,650
far Chelsea travels,
that's a c.

78
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,860
And this is how far Alice
travels, and she is going

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,670
to travel 400 meters more.

80
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,130
OK, that's what those
two equations tell us.

81
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,890
And what is their question?

82
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,510
They're asking us, how many
minutes did it take Bill

83
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,210
to overtake Chelsea?

84
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,550
How many minutes did it take
Bill to overtake Chelsea?

85
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,950
All right, so let's say we
want to know time in minutes.

86
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,450
How long does it take Bill
to overtake Chelsea?

87
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,600
Let's say we know
that it's time, t.

88
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,250
So that tells us that the
velocity of Bill times this

89
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,300
time is going to be equal to
--for him to overtake Chelsea,

90
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,370
he has to travel 300 meters
more than her in that

91
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,390
same amount of time.

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,080
So he has to go 300 meters
more than how far Chelsea

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
travels in that time.

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,270
So that's what this is, and
then we essentially are just

95
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,200
trying to solve for this time.

96
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,150
We want to be able
to solve for this.

97
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,190
Let's solve this equation.

98
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,620
Remember, all these equations
really have the same form.

99
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,410
In order for this person
to overtake this

100
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,710
person in 6 minutes.

101
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,770
That means in 6 minutes she
would have to travel 100

102
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,100
meters more than him.

103
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,360
In 12 minutes she would
have to travel 400 meters

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,020
more than Chelsea.

105
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,090
And then in t minutes-- and
that's what we're going to have

106
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,850
to solve the problem for --b is
going to have to travel

107
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,150
300 meters more than
Chelsea right there.

108
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,800
We just solve for t, so
let's just solve for t.

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,440
So what do you get?

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:57,750
You get vbt minus vct
is equal to 300.

111
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,240
I just subtracted Chelsea's
velocity times time from

112
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,060
both sides of the equation.

113
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,380
We can factor out the
time, so let's do that.

114
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,590
So you get vb minus vc times
time-- I'm just factoring out

115
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,180
the time --is equal to 300.

116
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:25,310
Or time is equal to
300/vb minus vc.

117
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,580
So if we could somehow figure
out what this is equal

118
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,680
to, then we would have
solved our problem.

119
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,450
Let's see if we can use
the other information.

120
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,750
Let's see, if we solve for vb
here and solved for vc here,

121
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,330
hopefully the va's
will cancel out.

122
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,900
And I suspect they will,
otherwise this problem

123
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,440
would not be solvable.

124
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,330
So let's do that.

125
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,510
Let's rewrite this
equation up here.

126
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,845
Let's solve for vb,
for Bill's velocity.

127
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:51,305
   

128
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:54,920
Let's see, if we divide both
sides by 6-- well, let's

129
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,780
subtract 100 from both sides.

130
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,180
So you have Bill's velocity
times 6-- that's just that

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,250
--is equal to 6 times
Alice's velocity minus 100.

132
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,470
All I did is I subtracted
100 from both sides of

133
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,090
this equation and I
swapped the sides.

134
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,530
Divide both sides by 6.

135
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,890
You got the velocity of Bill
is equal to the velocity

136
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,360
of Alice minus 100/6.

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,160
100/6 or 50/3-- I'll just
keep it as a 100/6.

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,700
Fair enough.

139
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,480
Let's see if we can do the same
thing with this equation.

140
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,110
   

141
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,670
If we subtract 400 from both
sides, we get 12 times

142
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,490
Chelsea's velocity is equal
to 12 times Alice's

143
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,580
velocity minus 400.

144
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,780
Divide both sides of
this equation by 12.

145
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,790
You get Chelsea's velocity
is equal to Alice's

146
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,170
velocity minus 400/12.

147
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,150
All right.

148
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:04,170
So let's if we can substitute
this back in for vb, and

149
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,680
substitute this back in for vc.

150
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,530
And hopefully the
va's cancel out.

151
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,780
It already looks
like they should.

152
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,050
So our time, the time that it
takes for Bill to overtake

153
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,920
Chelsea-- remember that's what
t was, it's always good to

154
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,250
remind yourself what this whole
problem was about to begin

155
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,340
with --is equal to 300/vb.

156
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,460
Well instead of vb
let's write this.

157
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:38,900
Va, the velocity of Alice,
minus 100/6 minus vc.

158
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,890
So minus this right here.

159
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:47,730
Minus va minus 400/12.

160
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,710
This should simplify to
t-- I'll just arbitrarily

161
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,880
switch colors.

162
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,370
t is equal to 300/va
minus-- what's 100/6?

163
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,290
100/6 is the same
thing as 50/3.

164
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,420
Distribute the minus sign.

165
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,400
Minus va-- we can already see
these are going to cancel out

166
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,610
--minus times a minus plus
400/12 is the same thing

167
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,560
is 200/6 or 100/3.

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,460
Right?

169
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,950
Plus 100/3.

170
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,300
These two cancel
out, va minus va.

171
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,640
So then we're left with
t is equal to 300 over

172
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,300
100/3 minus 50/3.

173
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,640
Right?

174
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,030
Or I could say minus 50/3 plus
100/3, but either way, minus

175
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,480
50/3 plus 100/3 is just 50/3.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,380
Did I do that right?

177
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,990
If I divide the top and the
bottom by 4, I get this.

178
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,400
And then sure, this is
a 100/3 and than 50/3.

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,790
And so when you divide by a
fraction that's the same thing

180
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,210
is multiplying by its inverse.

181
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,550
300 times 3/50 over 1.

182
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,800
And then we can cancel out
some terms, so we don't have

183
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,010
to multiply big numbers.

184
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,470
So if we divide the top and the
bottom by 50 that becomes 1,

185
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:13,550
this becomes 6, and then we're
left with t is equal to 6 times

186
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,340
3/1, which is 18, and all the
time units we were working with

187
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,070
the whole time were in minutes.

188
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,795
And we're done.

189
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,330
That was a little hairier than
the other two, but notice we

190
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,190
were able to solve it by just
algebraically writing down the

191
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,670
information that they actually
gave us in the problem and just

192
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,580
seeing what we have to solve
for and then substituting back

193
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,250
in and then miraculously
things canceled out.

194
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,700
And in general, if you're given
a nice problem like this you

195
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,480
can normally just, you know,
march forward knowing that if

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,650
you do things correctly
probably nice things will

197
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,220
happen and terms
will cancel out.

198
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,830
But I thought you would find
that interesting and once

199
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,230
again, thanks to Kortaggio
for that problem.

200
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,464
