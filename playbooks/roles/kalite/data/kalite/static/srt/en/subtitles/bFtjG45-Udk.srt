1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,770
And now I want to do a bunch
of examples dealing with

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:07,160
probably the two most typical
types of polynomial

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,550
multiplication that you'll see,
definitely, in algebra.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,640
And the first is just
squaring a binomial.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,600
So if I have x plus 9 squared, I
know that your temptation is

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,630
going to say, oh, isn't that
x squared plus 9 squared?

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,260
And I'll say, no, it isn't.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,260
You have to resist every
temptation on the

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,660
planet to do this.

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,280
It is not x squared
plus 9 squared.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,610
Remember, x plus 9 squared,
this is equal to x plus 9,

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,630
times x plus 9.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,940
This is a multiplication of this
binomial times itself.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,350
You always need to
remember that.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,900
It's very tempting to think that
it's just x squared plus

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,760
9 squared, but no, you have
to expand it out.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,160
And now that we've expanded it
out, we can use some of the

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,250
skills we learned in the last
video to actually multiply it.

20
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,370
And just to show you that we can
do it in the way that we

21
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,910
multiplied the trinomial last
time, let's multiply x plus 9,

22
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,760
times x plus a magenta 9.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,850
And I'm doing it this way just
to show you when I'm

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,880
multiplying by this
9 versus this x.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,740
But let's just do it.

26
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,970
So we go 9 times 9 is 81.

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,800
Put it in the constants'
place.

28
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,630
9 times x is 9x.

29
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,830
Then we have-- go switch to this
x term-- we have a yellow

30
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,240
x. x times 9x is 9x.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,022
Put it in the first
degree space.

32
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:40,960
x times x is x squared.

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,670
   

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,700
And then we add everything up.

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,520
And we get x squared
plus 18x plus 81.

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,650
So this is equal to x squared
plus 18x plus 81.

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,560
Now you might see a little bit
of a pattern here, and I'll

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,965
actually make the pattern
explicit in a second.

39
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:06,010
But when you square a binomial,
what happened?

40
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,750
You have x squared.

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,190
You have this x times this
x, gives you x squared.

42
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,920
You have the 9 times
the 9, which is 81.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,950
And then you have this term
here which is 18x.

44
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,910
How did we get that 18x?

45
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,210
Well, we multiplied this x times
9 to get 9x, and then we

46
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,510
multiplied this 9 times
x to get another 9x.

47
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,960
And then we added the two
right here to get 18x.

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,250
So in general, whenever you have
a squared binomial-- let

49
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,890
me do it this way.

50
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,250
I'll do it in very general
terms. Let's say we have a

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,630
plus b squared.

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,340
   

53
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,740
Let me multiply it this way
again, just to give you the

54
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,630
hang of it.

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:53,250
This is equal to a plus b, times
a plus-- I'll do a green

56
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,770
b right there.

57
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,440
So we have to b times
b is b squared.

58
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,410
Let's just assume that this
is a constant term.

59
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,510
I'll put it in the b squared
right there.

60
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,860
I'm assuming this is constant.

61
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,060
So this would be a constant,
this would be

62
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
analogous to our 81.

63
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,640
a is a variable that we--
actually let me change that up

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,040
even better.

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,270
Let me make this into x plus b
squared, and we're assuming b

66
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,750
is a constant.

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:30,890
So it would be x plus b, times x
plus a green b, right there.

68
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,700
So assuming b's a constant,
b times b is b squared.

69
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,060
b times x is bx.

70
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,090
And then we'll do
the magenta x.

71
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,140
x times b is bx.

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,900
And then x times
x is x squared.

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,330
So when you add everything,
you're left with x squared

74
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,840
plus 2bx, plus b squared.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,010
So what you see is, the end
product, what you have when

76
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,340
you have x plus b squared, is
x squared, plus 2 times the

77
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,490
product of x and b,
plus b squared.

78
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,750
So given that pattern, let's
do a bunch more of these.

79
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,910
   

80
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,709
And I'm going to do
it the fast way.

81
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,850
So 3x minus 7 squared.

82
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,980
Let's just remember
what I told you.

83
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,340
Just don't remember it, in the
back of your mind, you should

84
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,780
know why it makes sense.

85
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,350
If I were to multiply this
out, do the distributive

86
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,740
property twice, you know you'll
get the same answer.

87
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,730
So this is going to be equal
to 3x squared, plus 2 times

88
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,990
3x, times negative 7.

89
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,280
Right?

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,630
We know that it's 2 times each
the product of these terms,

91
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,700
plus negative 7 squared.

92
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,200
And if we use our product rules
here, 3x squared is the

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,950
same thing as 9x squared.

94
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,440
This right here, you're going
to have a 2 times a 3, which

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,980
is 6, times a negative 7,
which is negative 42x.

96
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,670
And then a negative 7
squared is plus 49.

97
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,930
That was the fast way.

98
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,600
And just to make sure that I'm
not doing something bizarre,

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,950
let me do it the slow
way for you.

100
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:32,320
3x minus 7, times 3x minus 7.

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,940
Negative 7 times negative
7 is positive 49.

102
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,310
Negative 7 times 3x
is negative 21x.

103
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,220
3x times negative 7
is negative 21x.

104
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,280
3x times 3x is 9 x squared.

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,060
Scroll to the left
a little bit.

106
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,050
Add everything.

107
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:02,060
You're left with 9x squared,
minus 42x, plus 49.

108
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,050
So we did indeed get
the same answer.

109
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,580
Let's do one more, and we'll
do it the fast way.

110
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,130
So if we have 8x minus 3--
actually, let me do one which

111
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,920
has more variables in it.

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,370
Let's say we had 4x squared plus
y squared, and we wanted

113
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,360
to square that.

114
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
Well, same idea.

115
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,820
This is going to be equal to
this term squared, 4x squared,

116
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,840
squared, plus 2 times the
product of both terms, 2 times

117
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,210
4x squared times y
squared, plus y

118
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,710
squared, this term, squared.

119
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,800
And what's this going
to be equal to?

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,430
This is going to be equal to
16-- right, 4 squared is 16--

121
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:53,320
x squared, squared, that's 2
times 2, so it's x to the

122
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,730
fourth power.

123
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,330
And then plus, 2 times
4 times 1, that's

124
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,820
8x squared y squared.

125
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,300
And then y squared, squared,
is y to the fourth.

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,390
Now, we've been dealing with
squaring a binomial.

127
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,140
The next example I want to show
you is when I take the

128
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,700
product of a sum and
a difference.

129
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,350
And this one actually comes
out pretty neat.

130
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,160
So I'm going to do a very
general one for you.

131
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,160
Let's just do a plus
b, times a minus b.

132
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,400
So what's this going
to be equal to?

133
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,660
This is going to be equal to a
times a-- let me make these

134
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,260
actually in different colors--
so a minus b, just like that.

135
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,900
So it's going to be this green
a times this magenta a, a

136
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:55,380
times a, plus, or maybe I should
say minus, the green a

137
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,670
times this b.

138
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,560
I got the minus from
right there.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,370
And then we're going to have the
green b, so plus the green

140
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,230
b times the magenta a.

141
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,920
I'm just multiplying every
term by every term.

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:17,250
And then finally minus the green
b-- that's where the

143
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,050
minus is coming from--
minus the green b

144
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,370
times the magenta b.

145
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,590
And what is this going
to be equal to?

146
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,220
This is going to be equal
to a squared, and then

147
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,020
this is minus ab.

148
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,840
This could be rewritten as
plus ab, and then we have

149
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,039
minus b squared.

150
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,130
These right here cancel out,
minus ab plus ab, so you're

151
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,600
just left with a squared
minus b squared.

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,430
Which is a really neat
result because it

153
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,120
really simplifies things.

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,190
So let's use that notion to
do some multiplication.

155
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:55,470
So if we say 2x minus
1, times 2x plus 1.

156
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,710
Well, these are the
same thing.

157
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,810
The 2x plus 1, you could view
this as, if you like, a plus

158
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,750
b, and the 2x minus 1, you can
view it as a minus b, where

159
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,830
this is a, and that b is 1.

160
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,440
This is b.

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,010
That is a.

162
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,660
Just using this pattern that
we figured out just now.

163
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,680
So what is this going
to be equal to?

164
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,820
It's going to be a squared, it's
going to be 2x squared,

165
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,490
minus b squared, minus
1 squared.

166
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,790
2x squared is 4x squared.

167
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,180
1 squared is just
1, so minus 1.

168
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,210
So it's going to be 4x
squared minus 1.

169
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,560
Let's do one more of these,
just to really

170
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,890
hit the point home.

171
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,590
   

172
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,290
I'll just focus on
multiplication right now.

173
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,040
If I have 5a minus 2b, and
I'm multiplying that

174
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,910
times 5a plus 2b.

175
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,640
And remember, this only applies
when I have at a

176
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,750
product of a sum and
a difference.

177
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,410
That's the only time that
I can use this.

178
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,850
And I've shown you why.

179
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,320
And if you're ever in doubt,
just multiply it out.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,880
It'll take you a little
bit longer.

181
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,630
And you'll see the terms
canceling out.

182
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,070
You can't do this for just any
binomial multiplication.

183
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,590
You saw that earlier in the
video, when we were

184
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,080
multiplying, when we were
taking squares.

185
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,560
So this is going to be, using
the pattern, it's going to be

186
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:28,310
5a squared minus 2b squared,
which is equal to 25 a squared

187
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,400
minus 4b squared.

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,330
And, well, I'll leave it there,
and I'll see you in the

189
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,900
next video.
