1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,270
In the last video we had a
three-dimensional surface,

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,170
where the height z was
a function of x and y.

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,760
And it gave us surface in
three-dimensional space.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,700
Now let's try to get our heads
around what the gradient

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,340
of a function of three
variables looks like.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,920
So the easiest one for me to
imagine is a scalar field.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,440
So what's a scalar field?

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,920
One that I find fairly
intuitive is temperature in

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,140
a three-dimensional room.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,140
So let's say the temperature
in a room is a function of

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,700
where I am in the room.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,670
So let's say it's a function of
my x, y, and z coordinates.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,340
And I don't know, I have never
actually modeled temperature.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,330
But let's say I have, I don't
know, a 20 kelvin-- actually,

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,290
let me make it so that our
vector field works out right.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,460
Let's say we have a 10
kelvin heat force in

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,950
the center of our room.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,650
I can imagine as you go further
and further away from that

20
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,600
heat source it's going to
get colder and colder.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,940
So let's say that the
temperature function.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,810
And let's say that center of
the room is at the coordinates

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,240
x, y, and z is equal to 0.

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,170
So let's say our temperature
function-- I'm just making this

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:23,880
up, I don't know if this is an
accurate model of temperature--

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,700
it's equal to 10 times e
to the minus r squared.

27
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,940
Now why did I say r?

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,260
I said it's a function
of x, y, and z.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,350
Well I'm just saying that it
exponentially decays as you

30
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,560
get further and further
away from that source.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Kind of radially further and
further away from that source.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,440
So what's the radial
distance away?

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,310
And this actually isn't that
relevant to learning gradients,

34
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,320
but let's get a little
intuition about what that

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,230
actual temperature function--
how it actually changes as

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,210
you go through the room.

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,030
So the radius away from the
center, that's just going to be

38
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,030
r squared is just x squared
plus y squared plus z squared.

39
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,070
That's just the Pythagorean
theorem in three dimensions.

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,550
So let's write our
temperature function.

41
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:18,840
So let's write temperature as
a function of x, y, and z is

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:29,990
equal to 10 e to the minus x
squared plus y squared plus z

43
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,370
squared-- which is exactly
what I wrote up here.

44
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,790
Instead of x squared plus y
squared plus z squared, I wrote

45
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,130
r squared, just to kind of give
you the intuition that this

46
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,220
expression is just saying the
square of the distance as we

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,010
get away from the center of
our room, or from the

48
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,990
coordinate 0, 0, 0.

49
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,310
But that's not what
we're learning here.

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,880
But I want you to understand,
at least conceptualize this,

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,350
it's hard to draw
a scalar field.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,460
All a scalar field means is
that in any point in this

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,970
base-- and in this case we're
dealing with three-dimensional

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,040
space-- at any point in that
space we can associate a value.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
And that makes sense.

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
If you were to take a
thermometer and measure any

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,180
point in space in the room
that you're in right now,

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,540
you would get a temperature.

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,590
You wouldn't get a temperature
and a direction, so it's

60
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,250
not a vector field.

61
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,530
You would just get
a temperature.

62
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,510
And that's why it's
called a scalar field.

63
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,090
Associated with every
coordinate is just

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,610
a temperature.

65
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,890
So how would we view the
gradient of this function?

66
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,720
Well the gradient of this
function is going to tell us in

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,290
which direction-- and actually,
the gradient of this function

68
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,210
is going to generate a vector
field, because it's going to

69
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,990
tell us in which direction
do we have the largest

70
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,580
increase in temperature.

71
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,660
And also, the magnitude of
those vectors in that vector

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,230
field will tell us how large
of an increase in temperature

73
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,320
we are looking at.

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,910
Or you can kind of
view it as almost a

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,220
three-dimensional slope.

76
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,190
Hope that doesn't confuse you.

77
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,260
So let's compute the gradient,
and then I'll show you a

78
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,630
diagram that might make things
a little bit more intuitive.

79
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,210
Let me erase this
thing down here.

80
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,480
And I'm going to switch from
this blue color, because

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,590
it's a little nauseating.

82
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:22,540
So the gradient of T is going
to be equal to the partial

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,490
derivative T with respect to x
times the unit vector in the x

84
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,550
direction, plus the partial
derivative of the temperature

85
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,940
function with respect to y
times the unit vector in the y

86
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,740
direction, plus the partial
derivative of the temperature

87
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,830
function with respect to z
times the unit vector

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,080
in the z direction.

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,180
And now we just plug and
chug and figure out the

90
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,130
partial derivatives.

91
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,470
So the gradient of T is equal
to-- now you might be daunted.

92
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,250
Oh, I have an e to this three
variable function, how do I

93
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,050
take the partial derivative?

94
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,500
Remember, if you're taking the
partial derivative with respect

95
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,140
to x you just pretend like the
y's and the z's are constants.

96
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,360
So let's do that.

97
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,500
So let's take the derivative
of the inside function.

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,090
That's the way I view it.

99
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,870
So minus x squared plus y
squared plus z squared,

100
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,440
with respect to x.

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,810
So you could distribute
this minus if you like.

102
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,980
So it'd be minus x
squared minus y squared

103
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,850
minus z squared.

104
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,890
So the derivative of that with
respect to x is just going to

105
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,715
be-- these are just constants,
so the derivative with

106
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,180
respect to x is just 0.

107
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,590
So the derivative is minus 2x.

108
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,860
Right?

109
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,670
Minus 2x is the derivative
of minus x squared.

110
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,330
Minus 2x times the
derivative of the outside.

111
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,510
Well, what's the
derivative of e to the x?

112
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,100
The derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

113
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,990
That's why e is such
an amazing number.

114
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,810
And this 10 here, this is just
a constant that when you take

115
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,320
the derivative of a constant
times something the

116
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,700
constant carries over.

117
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,370
So the derivative of the
outside expression, the way I

118
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,810
imagine it, is equal to 10 e
to the minus x squared plus

119
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,860
y squared plus z squared.

120
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,280
And then all of that times the
unit vector in the i direction.

121
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,600
Right?

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,040
And now we can do the same
thing for the y direction.

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,790
So plus-- what's the
partial derivative of

124
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,760
this with respect to y?

125
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,820
Well it's going to
look very similar.

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,803
The partial derivative of this
inner function with respect

127
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:42,500
to y, it's minus y squared.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,250
So it's minus 2y.

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,670
   

130
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,320
And then the derivative
of the whole thing is

131
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,680
just itself again.

132
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,680
So times 10 e to the
minus x squared plus y

133
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,180
squared plus z squared.

134
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,660
And then all of that times
the unit vector in the

135
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,920
y direction times j.

136
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,370
And then finally, the partial
derivative of the temperature

137
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,140
function with respect to z.

138
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:23,350
And that's just minus 2z times
10 e to the minus x squared

139
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,500
plus y squared plus z squared.

140
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,620
This is just the chain rule.

141
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,690
And I'm treating the other two
variables that I'm not taking

142
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,870
the partial derivative with
respect to, as constants.

143
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,430
And then all of that times the
unit vector in the k direction.

144
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,800
And we could simplify
this a little bit.

145
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
You could have
minus 2x times 10.

146
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,910
That's minus 20x.

147
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:44,750
Let me write it up here.

148
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,740
So the gradient of the
temperature function is equal

149
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:58,120
to minus 20 e to the minus x
squared plus y squared-- you

150
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:07,970
probably can't read this-- plus
z squared, times i minus 20y.

151
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,860
And actually, I'm not going to
go into that, because I realize

152
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,820
I'm running out of time.

153
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,880
I think you can simplify
this algebraically.

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,370
But anyway, the more important
thing is I always find with

155
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,980
gradients it's easy to
calculate them, but the

156
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,800
intuition-- oh sorry.

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
This is also included.

158
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,180
This is a k right here.

159
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,520
The harder part is
the intuition.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,920
So let's get an intuition of
what this gradient function

161
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,130
will actually look like.

162
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,880
So what would happen.

163
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,220
If you wanted to know the
gradient at any point in space,

164
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,170
you would substitute an
x, y, and z in here.

165
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:40,560
So you could write it as
the gradient function is a

166
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,160
function of x, y, and z.

167
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,170
Remember, T, the temperature at
any point, was a scalar field.

168
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,820
At any point in three
dimensions it just

169
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,890
gave you a number.

170
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,040
Now when you have the gradient,
at any point in three

171
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,100
dimensions it gives
you a vector.

172
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,380
Right?

173
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,950
Because it has i, j,
and k components.

174
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,330
Where the magnitude are the
partial derivatives, and

175
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,850
then the direction is
given by i, j, and k.

176
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,990
So we've gone from having a
scalar field to a vector field.

177
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,070
And let's see what
it looks like.

178
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,570
   

179
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,120
And let me make it bigger so we
can explore it a little bit.

180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,370
   

181
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,480
I think that's pretty good.

182
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,600
So this is the vector field.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,220
This is actually the gradient
of the function that

184
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,220
we just solved for.

185
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,170
And as you can see, at any
point-- and when this graphing

186
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,780
program that did it, it just
picked different points and it

187
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,620
calculated the gradients at
that point, and then it

188
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,230
graphed them as vectors.

189
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,550
So the length of the vectors
are just the magnitudes of

190
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,170
the x, y, and z components.

191
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,260
And then you add them together
like you would add any vectors.

192
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,880
And then the direction is given
by the relative weighting of

193
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
the i, j, and k components.

194
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,440
And as you can see, the
intuition is pretty

195
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,950
interesting.

196
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,850
As you get closer and closer to
our heat source, the rate at

197
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,440
which the temperature
increases, increases!

198
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,720
Right?

199
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,680
The vectors as you get closer,
get bigger and bigger.

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,390
And let me zoom in.

201
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,875
Let's actually fly in
to the vector field.

202
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,740
   

203
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,620
So we're now within
the vector field.

204
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,840
And you can see as we get
closer and closer to the center

205
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,980
of our heat source, the
vectors, the rate at which the

206
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,860
temperature increases, gets
bigger and bigger and bigger.

207
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,450
Anyway, I hope I
didn't confuse you.

208
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,950
When I first learned gradients,
I think the computation is

209
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,840
relatively straightforward.

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,130
It's just partial derivatives.

211
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,660
But the intuition is always
the interesting thing.

212
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,440
And hopefully this temperature
analogy-- and not even

213
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,515
analogy-- this temperature
model will make a

214
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,020
little sense to you.

215
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,360
But it applies to pretty
much any scalar field.

216
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,100
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
