1
00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:05,017
There are 11 major muscle groups in the body

2
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:07,309
and I'm just going to go through them really quickly

3
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:09,288
I'm not going to talk too much about the names

4
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:12,079
of the muscles, but I want you to get a sense for where they are located

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:19,231
on the body. So the arm, the leg, and the core.

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:21,554
and I'll write that over here. So the 11 groups

7
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,686
there are three - actually four- in the arm.

8
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,533
three in the leg

9
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,133
and four in the core.

10
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,032
And just being familiar with where these muscles are is actually

11
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,767
really really helpful and powerful because when you

12
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,172
go to the gym or you're working out somewhere else,

13
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:39,779
it's important to stretch these muscle groups out

14
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,616
it's important to also focus on each one

15
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,982
and try to figure out which one is weak or strong

16
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:48,155
and develop whichever one is imbalanced

17
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,747
sometimes the left and the right side are not equal in their strength.

18
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,422
So it's important to be aware of where they're located

19
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,535
and we're going to go through that really quickly right now.

20
00:00:56,535 --> 00:00:58,737
So let's do the arm first.

21
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:04,163
You have first the forearm. And you can see that one the best from the front.

22
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:10,798
And above that you have the biceps, and that's about right there.

23
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:16,500
There's your biceps. And behind your biceps, actually on the other side

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,852
is the triceps, and that's right there.

25
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:21,600
And above both the biceps and the triceps is the shoulder.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,169
And actually I'm going to draw that right there.

27
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,197
You can actually see it from the front and the back.

28
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:28,769
I'm just gonna draw it right there, just for simplicity.

29
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,171
So those are the four arm muscles, and now let's just jump down to the leg.

30
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:37,370
And put in the quads, this is your quadriceps.

31
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:43,552
And this is actually called the quadriceps because it's actually four different muscles working together

32
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:49,236
And below the quads- or actually on the other side of your quads, rather- is your hamstring.

33
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,104
Right here is your hamstring.

34
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:55,074
And I want to give a special shout out to the hamstring

35
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,224
because it does a lot of work and a lot of people forget to stretch it out.

36
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:04,057
And you can often get in a lot of pain from not having a good stretched out hamstring.

37
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:08,258
Below it is the calfs.

38
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:15,172
And the calf is actually sitting on the opposite side

39
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:19,318
of the bones in the lower leg, the tibia and fibula

40
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,832
which is why it's so boney on the front part of your lower leg,

41
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,021
but on the back it's very meaty and muscley.

42
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,638
So you have three leg muscles there.

43
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,418
Now let's put in the core muscles.

44
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,327
So you have, let's do the front first.

45
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:39,176
So right here is where we'll talk about getting a six-pack.

46
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:42,519
Your abs. That's an important muscle group.

47
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,101
Helps you do sit-ups.

48
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:54,001
And above it is your chest. So right here is your chest.

49
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,144
And there are two in the front. And similarly there are

50
00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:05,070
two in the back. So the back ones-let me do in yellow-

51
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,983
are your trapezius, and trapezius actually kind of

52
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:13,288
comes down like a diamond almost- kind of like that.

53
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:17,925
And it helps with the neck and upper back.

54
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:21,142
And then almost like you have wings in a way

55
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:24,224
you have two other muscles, or actually another muscle

56
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,427
with two sides on it, called the Latissimus dorsi.

57
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:32,007
Actually kind of a large spread out muscle- and I'm not drawing all of it.

58
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:35,824
But it basically kind of spreads all the way through your back

59
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:39,577
and this is the major muscle of your back.

60
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:42,670
So when people say "I threw out my back" often times, if it's the

61
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,574
lower back they're talking their Latissimus dorsi.

62
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,957
And that means that we have now our four core muscles shown up here.

63
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:55,361
So counting them out, we've got our 11 muscle groups.

64
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:03,044
So just to again go over it very quickly, we've got one shoulder, biceps, forearm, and triceps.

65
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:07,171
In our leg we have our quads, our hamstring and our calf.

66
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:10,422
And then in the core of our body we have our abs, our chest,

67
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:18,607
our upper back-which would be the trapezius- and the lower back-which is the latissimus dorsi.

68
00:04:18,607 --> 00:04:21,000
That's your eleven groups.
