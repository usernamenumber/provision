1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,832
To get a better intuition for the price elasticity of demand

2
00:00:03,832 --> 00:00:04,827
I thought I would take a look

3
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:07,068
at some of the more extreme cases,

4
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:08,178
and think about

5
00:00:08,178 --> 00:00:11,768
what types of elasticities of demand we would see.

6
00:00:11,768 --> 00:00:15,366
So this right over here is a vial of insulin.

7
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:20,053
Many diabetics (not all diabetics) need to take insulin daily.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,084
They need to inject it in order to maintain their blood sugar level.

9
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:25,889
If they don't do it, bad things will happen to their bodies

10
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,886
and they might prematurely die.

11
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:30,509
if they don't take their insulin on time.

12
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,422
So let's think about what the elasticity of demand

13
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:35,603
might look like for something like insulin.

14
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,736
So in one column I'll put price

15
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,397
and in the other column I will put quantity.

16
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:46,707
So let's say that insulin right now is going for $5 a vial.

17
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:49,344
We have a group of diabetics who need insulin

18
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:51,797
and they're all going to buy the insulin they need

19
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:53,282
and let's say this group--

20
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:57,942
that turns out to be 100 vials per week.

21
00:00:57,942 --> 00:01:02,586
(So this is in vials per week.)

22
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:04,609
Fair enough, that's exactly what they need to do

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,353
to maintain their insulin.

24
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:08,066
Now what happens if the price changes?

25
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:09,890
What happens if the price were to go down?

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,292
Let's say that the price were to go down to $1.

27
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,179
Well, what would the quantity be?

28
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:18,074
Well they're not going to buy any more insulin.

29
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:19,511
They're going to buy just what they need

30
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,541
in order to maintain their diabetes.

31
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,477
And remember, we're holding all else equal--

32
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:26,043
we're not assuming any change in expectations of price:

33
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,825
do they expect price to go up or down or anything like that.

34
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:32,550
So in this case, they'll still just buy 100 vials.

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,049
Now what happens if the price went up a ton?

36
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,332
What happens if the price went to $100 a vial?

37
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,443
Well, it would be hard for them,

38
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,974
but they need it to survive.

39
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,734
So it's going to squeeze out any other expenses

40
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,387
that they need to spend money on.

41
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:50,271
And so they still will buy 100 vials a week.

42
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:52,650
And so you could keep raising price within reason

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,018
and they would still buy the same quantity.

44
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:56,752
Obviously if you raise it to a billion dollars,

45
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,639
they would just not be able to afford it.

46
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:02,750
But within reason, they're going to buy 100 vials a week,

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,667
no matter what the price is.

48
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:15,984
So this is an example of "perfect inelasticity."

49
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:18,733
Another way...so if you think of the physical analogy

50
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,463
that we talked about with elasticity

51
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:21,519
it's like a brick.

52
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,427
It doesn't matter how much...within reason once again,

53
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:26,251
any amount of force pulling or pushing

54
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,752
that a human could put on a brick,

55
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,675
it's not going to deform the brick in any way.

56
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:35,484
And likewise, any change in price within reason

57
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,839
isn't going to change the demand in any way.

58
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,774
It's perfectly inelastic.

59
00:02:39,774 --> 00:02:41,527
And if you want to do the computation,

60
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:46,043
you could figure out the demand elasticity.

61
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:50,386
But let's say when you are going from a price of $5 to $1.

62
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,480
So the price went down by 4

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,113
and the quantity changed by 0.

64
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:01,411
So your % change in quantity ...

65
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:11,008
delta % change in quantity is equal to zero,

66
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:16,351
and your % is going to be over your % change in price.

67
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:19,078
Your % change in price, if you use the averaging method,

68
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:23,272
it would be going down by 4 over an average of 250.

69
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,320
It'll be a fairly large number

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,535
but 0 over anything is still going to be 0.

71
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,000
So it doesn't matter what that thing is over here.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,450
Your elasticity of demand in this situation is 0.

73
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,001
And if you want to see

74
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,086
what this demand curve would look like,

75
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,443
let's plot it.

76
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:42,924
So this right over here is my price axis

77
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:46,350
and that is my quantity axis.

78
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,314
and so, no matter what,

79
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:51,995
let's say this is a quantity of 100 vials per week.

80
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:59,231
That's true when the price is $5.

81
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,451
They're going to demand 100 vials per week.

82
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,775
That's true when the price is $1.

83
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,051
They're going to demand 100 vials per week.

84
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:10,344
And that's true if the price is $20 or $100 or whatever--

85
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:13,686
they're going to demand 100 vials per week.

86
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:18,880
So a perfectly inelastic demand curve would look like this.

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,281
It is a vertical line.

88
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,075
It doesn't matter what price you pick--

89
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,998
the quantity demanded is always going

90
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,365
to be the exact same thing.

91
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,794
Now let's go to another extreme.

92
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:32,777
So this is perfectly inelastic,

93
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,386
you could imagine what is perfectly elastic?

94
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:36,820
Something that changes a lot

95
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,960
if you have a small % change in price.

96
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,928
And to think about that,

97
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,709
let's look at these two vending machines.

98
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,167
And we see that they both do sell cans of coke.

99
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,972
That's a can of coke there,

100
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,214
and that is a can of coke there.

101
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:51,852
Now let's say starting off, the can of coke,

102
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:58,378
let's say they cost $1 in each vending machine.

103
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,282
We're going to assume that this one,

104
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:01,521
remember all else equal,

105
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:03,483
so we're going to assume that

106
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:10,362
this vending machine right over here doesn't change.

107
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:15,119
So it's gonna be consistently charging $1 for a can of coke

108
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,979
and they're sitting next to each other and it looks like

109
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,118
they have a little coffee machine in between right over here.

110
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:23,279
So let's think about the demand curve for coca cola

111
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,236
in this vending machine right over here.

112
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,145
So let's think about the price and the quantity.

113
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:33,477
So let me do price column and quantity demanded.

114
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:41,059
So let's say if the price is a dollar

115
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,105
then, you know, just odds are,

116
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,640
it's going to get about half of the sales per week

117
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:57,147
and let's say that ends up being 100 cans per week.

118
00:05:57,147 --> 00:06:00,166
Now what happens (let me put some decimals here)

119
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,023
So this is one dollar.

120
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,268
The price is $1 and it sells 100 cans per week.

121
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:04,312
We can probably ...

122
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:06,258
this one would also sell about 100 cans per week.

123
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,351
Now what happens

124
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,258
if we have a very very small change in price?

125
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:14,066
So if we go from a dollar

126
00:06:14,066 --> 00:06:20,450
instead of a dollar we are at 99 cents.

127
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,134
What's going to happen?

128
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:25,614
So remember, this machine right over here is not changing.

129
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,061
We're talking about ... our demand curve is

130
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:30,597
for the quantity of cokes sold from this machine

131
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,749
and the price we're talking about is for this machine.

132
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:35,474
So if this machine is even a penny cheaper,

133
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:38,916
and assuming there aren't lines forming and things like that,

134
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,701
people are just always going to go to this machine.

135
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,727
If it's easy enough and there's no difference,

136
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:44,784
I will go to this machine.

137
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:48,011
So this machine will be able to sell all of the cokes.

138
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:51,735
So it's going to sell 200 cokes

139
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:52,813
Now what happens if,

140
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,732
instead of lowering the price by a penny,

141
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,232
you raise the price by a penny?

142
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:59,612
So instead of $1, you're at $1.01.

143
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:01,852
Well now everyone is going to go to the other vending machine.

144
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:05,383
They're going to say "oh, might as well walk to this one"

145
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,520
assuming everything else is equal.

146
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,361
So then they're going to sell zero

147
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,816
and so what would the demand curve look like here?

148
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:18,392
Well let's plot it out.

149
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:20,510
So this is the price,

150
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,132
this axis right over here is quantity,

151
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,144
and this is in cans per week

152
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:31,078
so this is zero, this is 100

153
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,672
and then this is 200

154
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:36,695
and then this is a price of $1, that's $1.

155
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,787
So at $1,

156
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:42,268
the quantity demanded is 100 cans, fair enough.

157
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:46,878
Now at 99 cents, the quantity demanded is 200 cans.

158
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,988
So at 99 cents the quantity demanded is 200.

159
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:52,707
So 99 cents is right below that--

160
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:57,463
it's 200 right over there,

161
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,838
just a little bit lower...

162
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,270
And at $1.01, a little bit over here,

163
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,940
the quantity demanded is 0.

164
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,989
So the demand curve here

165
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:13,018
is going to look something like that.

166
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,762
So it's going to be almost horizontal.

167
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,602
So it's going to be approaching perfect elasticity--

168
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:21,352
very small changes in price

169
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:27,496
end up with these huge changes in % quantity demanded

170
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,463
and I encourage you to work out the math you see here

171
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:33,540
that you will get a very large number for elasticity and

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,524
so something that is approaching perfect elasticity,

173
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,139
a truly perfect elasticity would be

174
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:43,284
something that is a horizontal line.

175
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:47,093
So in this case, our elasticity of demand,

176
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,552
and I'll talk about the absolute value of it, is zero.

177
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:51,556
And over here,

178
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:56,578
the absolute value of our elasticity of demand is infinity.

179
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,490
Because remember,

180
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,054
it's % change in quantity over % change in price.

181
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:03,790
When you go from one scenario to another over here,

182
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,145
your percent change in price is very small.

183
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,797
It's roughly about 1% in this scenario right over here.

184
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:12,485
You're changing the price up or down about 1%

185
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,195
but then you see your quantity is changing

186
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:15,902
depending on which one you're looking at,

187
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:16,898
your quantity is changing

188
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:21,133
on the order of 50 to 100% from that 1% change in price.

189
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,193
So you have a huge elasticity of demand here.

190
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,995
It would actually be a number, but as you can imagine

191
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:28,317
as it becomes more and more sensitive,

192
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,503
as quantity demanded becomes

193
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,118
more and more sensitive to % change in price,

194
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,085
this curve is going to flatten out completely

195
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:35,012
and you will have

196
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:40,658
an infinite absolute value of your elasticity of demand.
