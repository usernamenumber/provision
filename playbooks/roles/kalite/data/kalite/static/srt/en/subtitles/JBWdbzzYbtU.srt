1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,540
Let's review a little bit of
what we've learned about

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,510
reserve banking and then we'll
extend this to the notion of

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,720
an elastic money supplier, a
money supplier that can grow

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,510
or contract as people need
money-- or hopefully grows and

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,580
contracts as people
need money.

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,930
So let me create a a couple of
normal commercial banks.

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,900
Maybe I'll call these
national banks.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,400
They have a national charter.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,610
So let's see.

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:25,775
I have some equity and part of
that equity-- most of it is

12
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,170
some gold that I initially
capitalized the bank with.

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,730
And then some of it
is a building.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,610
Trying to draw this as neat as
possible, but I think you

15
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,050
understand my situation.

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,180
Then I take some gold deposits
from whoever-- the farmers

17
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,680
after the crop has
been harvested.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,470
And then offsetting that,
I have all of

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,490
the farmers' deposits.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,070
I'll do that in a blue color.

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,870
So that's one farmer's
deposit.

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,490
That's another-- maybe there's
only two farmers.

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,840
And then we learned in
fractional reserve banking

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,430
that I can leverage up this
amount of capital I have.

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,380
There's a certain ratio
between the amount of

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,410
capital-- in this case, gold or
reserves I have-- and the

27
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,040
amount of demand deposits I
can have. So let's say my

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,310
reserve requirement in this
world is-- just because I

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,480
don't want this bank to become
too tall-- let's say it's 50%.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
We know in reality reserve
requirements

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,450
are more like 10%.

32
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,700
Let me write that down.

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,600
   

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,220
So that means that my ratio
of gold to demand deposit

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,020
accounts cannot be any
less than 50%.

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,200
So whatever this amount is, I
can double it in terms of

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,340
demand deposit accounts and the
way I do that-- let's say

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,190
this is collectively 100 so
I could have up to 100.

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,330
Let's say this right
here, this is 50.

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,230
So I can have up to 200 in
demand deposit accounts.

41
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,810
So I can essentially lend out
money and create demand

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,270
deposit accounts.

43
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,420
This is all review for
you, hopefully.

44
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:15,530
So I could lend out 150.

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,910
Those are my liabilities and
then these are my loans and

46
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,610
my-- so that's one loan I make
out and I just create

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,610
someone's checking account.

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,290
That's the loan asset and I
create a demand deposit

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:25,990
account for them.

50
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,110
That's the liability.

51
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,270
This here could be a big
loan, et cetera.

52
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,335
And then I'm not the only
bank in this universe.

53
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:38,360
   

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,370
My other bank in the universe.

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,930
I just want to show you that
there are multiple banks.

56
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,060
Then we said there are a couple
of issues with this.

57
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,910
You have a 50% reserve
requirement, which is very

58
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,760
high, but what if there is a
situation where for whatever

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,510
reason your reserves
temporarily

60
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,310
drop below that 50%?

61
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,560
How do you get that
extra gold?

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,460
You don't want to go to people
and say, can I have a little

63
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,920
bit more gold?

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,300
Then they're going to get scared
and all pull out of

65
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,190
your system, but if you're a
little bit below 50%, but if

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,860
the other bank is a little
bit above 50%, it'd be a

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,730
convenient way if you could
borrow from that other bank--

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,430
or even better, if there was a
central depository where all

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,550
of these gold reserves were,
then you could just borrow

70
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,770
directly from that central
depository if there were no

71
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,860
other bank to borrow from.

72
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,220
So you could kind of view it as
a lender of last resort and

73
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,050
we'll go into more of the
technicalities of that one, in

74
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,940
particular talk about
our current system.

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,160
With that said, we created a
reserve bank where we put

76
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,940
these deposits.

77
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,340
Let's see.

78
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,480
There's 200 of deposits
in this world.

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,290
Let see me if I can just
copy and paste that.

80
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,940
   

81
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,500
So that's one of the reserves
and then they're the same, so

82
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,170
then that's the other reserve.

83
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,530
It doesn't look that neat.

84
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,240
All the banks got together
and created this.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,060
It's a private bank, but we'll
go into more details of of how

86
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,900
the actual Federal
Reserve works.

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,640
So those are the actual
gold reserves.

88
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,870
Those are the assets
of that bank.

89
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,760
Actually, I should move
it over some.

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,560
   

91
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,950
OK.

92
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:29,710
And then the liabilities for
this central reserve bank,

93
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,760
these are the demand deposit
accounts for these nationally

94
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,230
chartered banks.

95
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,360
So he took all of his gold,
put it here, and so now he

96
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,480
has-- to simplify it, he has a
demand deposit account, but

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,450
I'll assume that he just got
reserve notes to show that he

98
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,730
had access to this gold.

99
00:04:51,730 --> 00:05:03,560
So let's say that this is
100 notes outstanding.

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,680
This part corresponding to 100
gold pieces-- and this is

101
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,990
another 100-- although notes
outstanding, it's fungible,

102
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,880
you could mix them up because
you don't know where they came

103
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,400
from or whatever.

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,180
That's what's different
about those relative

105
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,960
to a checking account.

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,830
And so essentially this guy
gives his gold here and in

107
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,540
exchange he gets these Federal
Reserve notes, which are like

108
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,610
green pieces of paper.

109
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,810
And now these are actually
his reserves.

110
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,780
His reserves are
no longer gold.

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,230
His reserves are how much
of these Federal

112
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,040
Reserve notes he has?

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,060
And we learned in the last video
that only the Federal

114
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,230
Reserve-- or the reserve bank--
I haven't called it the

115
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,920
Federal Reserve yet, but I think
you see where this is

116
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,390
going-- only they can
issue these notes.

117
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,500
And these notes are these
rectangular green pieces of

118
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:55,850
paper with faces of presidents
on them, et cetera, et cetera.

119
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,850
And let's say in the government
we live in, they

120
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,720
kind of sanction-- even though
this is officially a private

121
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,810
bank, this reserve bank, it's
set up in such a way that even

122
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,800
though all of the original banks
might have originally

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,210
capitalized it with some equity,
they really don't get

124
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,760
any of the profits of this
bank-- and I'll go into detail

125
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,500
on how the actual Federal
Reserve works.

126
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,890
But let's just say any surplus
profits of this bank actually

127
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,500
just go back to the Federal
government.

128
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,840
So the Federal government
doesn't-- these banks don't

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,360
make any money off of this--
and actually let's say that

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,740
the board of directors of this
bank is actually appointed by

131
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,300
the government, et cetera,
et cetera.

132
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,630
So it's key to the
financial system.

133
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,110
So the government says, these
notes, sure, it's issued by

134
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,650
this reserve bank, but we want
people to have a lot of faith

135
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,250
in this currency because this is
the currency that we use in

136
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,490
our world, in our nation, so
in order for people to have

137
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,380
unlimited faith in this
currency, we are going to make

138
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,650
it an obligation of the
government-- so it's

139
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,940
issued by the bank.

140
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,920
Let me write that down.

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,480
This used to confuse
me to no end.

142
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,710
   

143
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:14,820
Issued by the reserve bank, but
it's an obligation of the

144
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,950
government.

145
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,100
Now, what does that mean?

146
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,740
Well, that means that if for
whatever reason-- even if this

147
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,760
reserve bank were to somehow not
have the gold to back it

148
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,100
up, it would go bankrupt, but
even in that situation, the

149
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,740
government would still be
obligated to give you the gold

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,680
equivalent of these notes,
whatever we decide it is.

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,170
Maybe it's 35 of these dollars
per ounce of gold or whatever.

152
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,250
But that's what that means.

153
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,900
So that gives a lot of people
confidence that these things

154
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,320
are, you can almost say,
as good as gold.

155
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,300
Why does it matter that the
government-- how can you trust

156
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,710
the government?

157
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,870
Well, the government can just
tax people, whether they're

158
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,510
going to tax them in terms of
dollars, whether they can tax

159
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,110
them in terms of gold, whether
they can tax them in terms of

160
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,180
goods and services.

161
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,050
So as long as you think that
that economy-- whatever the

162
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,230
economy is that this government
is governing over--

163
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,410
as long as you think that that
economy can somehow support

164
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,630
the gold to back this up, you
should say, this is as good as

165
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,380
gold-- or at least support
the goods and services.

166
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,920
Well, that said, let's introduce
the notion of an

167
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,380
elastic currency.

168
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,570
Actually before I do that, let's
go back to one thing

169
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,990
this government does.

170
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,510
So we said it's an obligation
of the government, right?

171
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,120
Which means if all else fails,
the government is going to

172
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,549
give you the value behind
these notes.

173
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,320
I'll introduce you to another
concept, which is actually

174
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,789
very similar to these notes--
and that is a government debt

175
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,670
or government borrowing.

176
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,120
Let me draw that down here.

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,580
I think I'm going to run out of
time, but I'll continue it

178
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,680
in the next video.

179
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
So I'm the government, right?

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,550
I mean, you could almost view
the government's asset as its

181
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,670
ability to tax people, but if
I'm the government and I issue

182
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,020
these government IOUs-- and
we'll call them treasury bonds

183
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:14,020
and bills-- let's call them
treasuries, generally.

184
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,520
Treasury bills are short term
treasuries where the

185
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,550
government borrows for a
shorter amount of time.

186
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,510
Bonds are longer term.

187
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,890
I think I've gone over that in
the yield curve video, but

188
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,860
I'll do that in more detail.

189
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,520
But they're just IOUs
from the government.

190
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,790
Now, these are going to be
considered as risk free.

191
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,610
Why are they considered
risk free?

192
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,700
Because they are denominated in
the same currency that the

193
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,590
government, that the economy
that this government governs

194
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,990
over, operates in.

195
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,750
So if this government-- and I
think you can understand that

196
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,630
this is essentially the U.S.
government-- if it borrows

197
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,480
money from you-- so it
gives you an IOU.

198
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,385
So this is me.

199
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:53,330
Let's say this is me, this
is the government.

200
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:05,590
If it gives me this IOU and I
give it $100, why do I know

201
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,880
that this IOU is risk free?

202
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
Well, because unless he starts--
the government-- I'm

203
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,520
making him masculine-- but
unless they start issuing an

204
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,250
unusual number of IOUs and just
have so much interest

205
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,520
that they can't sustain, you
know that they can always tax

206
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,860
more people to get you
back your $100.

207
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,070
So you view this thing right
here as risk free.

208
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,310
So whenever the government goes
out there and says, hey

209
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:38,350
everyone, we have a new war we
want to fight or some new type

210
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,250
of scheme, new bureaucracy we
would like to create, we are

211
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,460
going to borrow money from you--
someone is going to give

212
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,150
them their currency, their
Federal Reserve notes-- and in

213
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,790
exchange, the government's
going to give them

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,960
these risk free IOUs.

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,100
And then the government can use
these reserve notes to go

216
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,970
buy goods and services or
pay soldiers or pay the

217
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,150
bureaucrats.

218
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,560
Now we're going to use that
idea in the next video to

219
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,800
learn how this Federal Reserve
bank or this reserve bank can

220
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,610
buy and sell these government
securities in order to change

221
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,840
the money supply.

222
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,960
See you in the next video.
