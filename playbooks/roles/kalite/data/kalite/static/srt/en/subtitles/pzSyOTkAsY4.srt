1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,500
Let's see if we can learn
a thing or two about

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,160
the hyperbola.

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,320
   

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,680
And out of all the conic
sections, this is probably the

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,340
one that confuses people the
most, because it's not quite

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,820
as easy to draw as the
circle and the ellipse.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,160
You have to do a little
bit more algebra.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,930
But hopefully over the course
of this video you'll get pretty

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,540
comfortable with that, and
you'll see that hyperbolas in

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,660
some way are more fun than any
of the other conic sections.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,420
So just as a review, I want to
do this just so you see the

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,750
similarity in the formulas or
the standard form of the

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,740
different conic sections.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,330
If you have a circle centered
at 0, its equation is x

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:44,730
squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,720
And we saw that this could also
be written as-- and I'm doing

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,150
this because I want to show
that this is really just the

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,890
same thing as the standard
equation for an ellipse.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,870
If you divide both sides of
this by r squared, you get x

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:03,760
squared over r squared plus y
squared over r squared

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,775
is equal to 1.

23
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,080
And so this is a circle.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,000
And once again, just as review,
a circle, all of the points on

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,370
the circle are equidistant
from the center.

26
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,650
Or in this case, you can kind
of say that the major axis and

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,630
the minor axis are the same
distance, that there isn't any

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,470
distinction between the two.

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,280
You're always an equal distance
away from the center.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,780
So that was a circle.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,460
An ellipse was pretty much
this, but these two numbers

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,600
could be different.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,310
Because your distance from
the center could change.

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,850
So it's x squared over a
squared plus y squared over

35
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,590
b squared is equal to 1.

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,670
That's an ellipse.

37
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,620
And now, I'll skip parabola for
now, because parabola's kind

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,770
of an interesting case, and
you've already touched on it.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,050
So I'll go into more depth
in that in a future video.

40
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,820
But a hyperbola is very
close in formula to this.

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,630
And so there's two ways that a
hyperbola could be written.

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,770
And I'll do those two ways.

43
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,750
So it could either be written
as x squared over a squared

44
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,815
minus y squared over b
squared is equal to 1.

45
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:15,060
And notice the only difference
between this equation and this

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,880
one is that instead of a
plus y squared, we have

47
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,630
a minus y squared here.

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,870
So that would be one hyperbola.

49
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,400
The other one would be
if the minus sign was

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,730
the other way around.

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:33,970
If it was y squared over b
squared minus x squared over

52
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,330
a squared is equal to 1.

53
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,850
So now the minus is in front
of the x squared term instead

54
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,820
of the y squared term.

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,650
And what I want to do now is
try to figure out, how do

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,970
we graph either of
these parabolas?

57
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,170
Maybe we'll do both cases.

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,450
And in a lot of text books, or
even if you look it up over the

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,920
web, they'll give you formulas.

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,990
But I don't like
those formulas.

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,205
One, because I'll
always forget it.

62
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:56,530
And you'll forget it
immediately after

63
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,070
taking the test.

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,790
You might want to memorize
it if you just want to

65
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,450
be able to do the test
a little bit faster.

66
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,500
But you'll forget it.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,260
And the second thing is, not
only will you forget it, but

68
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,240
you'll probably get confused.

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Because sometimes they always
use the a under the x and the b

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,640
under the y, or sometimes they
always use the a under the

71
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,070
positive term and to b
under the negative term.

72
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,110
So if you just memorize, oh, a
divided by b, that's the slope

73
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,150
of the asymptote and all of
that, you might be using

74
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,040
the wrong a and b.

75
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,490
So I encourage you to always
re-prove it to yourself.

76
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,770
And that's what we're
going to do right here.

77
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,450
It actually doesn't
take too long.

78
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,440
So these are both hyperbolas.

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
And what I like to do
whenever I have a

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,070
hyperbola is solve for y.

81
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,480
So in this case, if I subtract
x squared over a squared from

82
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,970
both sides, I get-- let me
change the color-- I get minus

83
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,730
y squared over b squared.

84
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,420
That stays there.

85
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:53,680
Is equal to 1 minus x
squared over a squared.

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,960
And then, let's see, I want to
get rid of this minus, and I

87
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
want to get rid of
this b squared.

88
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation times

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,070
minus b squared.

90
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,900
If you multiply the left hand
side times minus b squared, the

91
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,550
minus and the b squared go
away, and you're just left

92
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,920
with y squared is equal
to minus b squared.

93
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,440
And then minus b squared
times a plus, it becomes

94
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,990
a plus b squared over
a squared x squared.

95
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,220
We're almost there.

96
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,890
And then you get y is equal
to-- and I'm doing this on

97
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,720
purpose-- the plus or minus
square root, because it can be

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,010
the plus or minus square root.

99
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,680
Of-- and let's switch these
around, just so I have

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,430
the positive term first.

101
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:49,270
b squared over a squared x
squared minus b squared.

102
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,060
Now you said, Sal, you
said this was simple.

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,890
I'm solving this.

104
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,430
This looks like a really
complicated thing.

105
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,380
But remember, we're doing this
to figure out asymptotes of the

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,740
hyperbola, just to kind of
give you a sense of

107
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,090
where we're going.

108
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,120
Let me do it here--
actually, I want to do

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,390
that other hyperbola.

110
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,630
So a hyperbola, if that's
the x, that's the y-axis,

111
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,340
it has two asymptotes.

112
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,410
And the asymptotes, they're
these lines that the

113
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,420
hyperbola will approach.

114
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,520
So if those are the two
asymptotes-- and they're always

115
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
the negative slope of each
other-- we know that this

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,110
hyperbola's is either, and
we'll show in a second which

117
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,090
one it is, it's either going to
look something like this, where

118
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,650
as we approach infinity we get
closer and closer this line and

119
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,150
closer and closer to that line.

120
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,395
And here it's either going to
look like that-- I didn't draw

121
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:36,095
it perfectly; it never
touches the asymptote.

122
00:05:36,095 --> 00:05:39,000
It just gets closer and closer
and closer, arbitrarily

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,750
close to the asymptote.

124
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,830
It's either going to look
like that, where it opens

125
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,230
up to the right and left.

126
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:51,610
Or our hyperbola's going
to open up and down.

127
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,860
And once again, as you go
further and further, and

128
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,430
asymptote means it's just going
to get closer and closer to one

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,260
of these lines without
ever touching it.

130
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,030
It will get infinitely close as
you get infinitely far away,

131
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,010
as x gets infinitely large.

132
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,930
So in order to figure out which
one of these this is, let's

133
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,420
just think about what happens
as x becomes infinitely large.

134
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,240
So as x approaches infinity.

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,250
So as x approaches infinity, or
x approaches negative infinity.

136
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,540
So I'll say plus or
minus infinity, right?

137
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,740
It doesn't matter, because
when you take a negative,

138
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,430
this gets squared.

139
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,100
So this number becomes really
huge as you approach positive

140
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,460
or negative infinity.

141
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,160
And you'll learn more about
this when we actually do

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,490
limits, but I think
that's intuitive.

143
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,650
That this number becomes huge.

144
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,020
This number's just a constant.

145
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,810
It just stays the same.

146
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,970
So as x approaches positive or
negative infinity, as it gets

147
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,050
really, really large, y is
going to be approximately equal

148
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,900
to-- actually, I think
that's congruent.

149
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,570
   

150
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,250
I always forget notation.

151
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,420
Approximately.

152
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,820
This just means not exactly
but approximately equal to.

153
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,450
When x approaches infinity,
it's going to be approximately

154
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,420
equal to the plus or minus
square root of b squared

155
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,070
over a squared x squared.

156
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,540
And that is equal to-- now you
can take the square root.

157
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,520
You couldn't take the square
root of this algebraically,

158
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
but this you can.

159
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,280
This is equal to plus
or minus b over a x.

160
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
So that tells us, essentially,
what the two asymptotes are.

161
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Where the slope of one
asymptote will be b over a x.

162
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,260
This could give you positive b
over a x, and the other one

163
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,650
would be minus b over a x.

164
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,930
And I'll do this with
some example so it makes

165
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,670
it a little clearer.

166
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,990
But we still know what the
asymptotes look like.

167
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,320
It's these two lines.

168
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,340
Because it's plus b a x is one
line, y equals plus b a x.

169
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,860
Let's say it's this one.

170
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,410
This asymptote right here is y
is equal to plus b over a x.

171
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,510
I know you can't read that.

172
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,920
And then the downward sloping
asymptote we could say is y is

173
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,730
equal to minus b over a x.

174
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,200
So those are two asymptotes.

175
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,580
But we still have to figure out
whether the hyperbola opens up

176
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,930
to the left and right, or
does it open up and down?

177
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,350
And there, there's
two ways to do this.

178
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,440
One, you say, well this
is an approximation.

179
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,865
This is what you approach
as x approaches infinity.

180
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:17,980
But we see here that even when
x approaches infinity, we're

181
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,060
always going to be a little
bit smaller than that number.

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,380
Because we're subtracting a
positive number from this.

183
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,950
We're subtracting a positive
number, and then we're taking

184
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,660
the square root of
the whole thing.

185
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,060
So we're always going to be a
little bit lower than the

186
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,110
asymptote, especially when
we're in the positive quadrant.

187
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,720
Right?

188
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,940
So to me, that's how
I like to do it.

189
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,185
I think, we're always-- at
least in the positive quadrant;

190
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,800
it gets a little more confusing
when you go to the other

191
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,340
quadrants-- we're always going
to be a little bit lower

192
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,260
than the asymptote.

193
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,460
So we're going to approach
from the bottom there.

194
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,050
And since you know you're
there, you know it's going

195
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,790
to be like this and
approach this asymptote.

196
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,960
And then since it's opening
to the right here, it's also

197
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,330
going to open to the left.

198
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,900
The other way to test it, and
maybe this is more intuitive

199
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,840
for you, is to figure out,
in the original equation

200
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,130
could x or y equal to 0?

201
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,440
Because when you open to the
right and left, notice you

202
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,110
never get to x equal to 0.

203
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,680
You get to y equal 0,
right here and here.

204
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,940
But you never get
to x equals 0.

205
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,620
And actually your teacher
might want you to plot these

206
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,730
points, and there you just
substitute y equals 0.

207
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,300
And you can just look at
the original equation.

208
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,240
Actually, you could even look
at this equation right here.

209
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,600
Can x ever equal 0?

210
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,890
If you look at this equation,
if x is equal to 0, this whole

211
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,370
term right here would cancel
out, and you'd just be left

212
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,730
with a minus b squared.

213
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,330
Which is, you're taking b
squared, and you put a

214
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,270
negative sign in front of it.

215
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,560
So that's a negative number.

216
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,780
And then you're taking a square
root of a negative number.

217
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,420
So we're not dealing with
imaginaries right now.

218
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,440
So you can never
have x equal to 0.

219
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,930
But y could be
equal to 0, right?

220
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,360
You can set y equal to 0 and
then you could solve for it.

221
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
So in this case,
actually let's do that.

222
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,050
If y is equal to 0, you get 0
is equal to the square root of

223
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,300
b squared over a squared x
squared minus b squared.

224
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,140
If you square both sides,
you get b squared over a

225
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,280
squared x squared minus
b squared is equal to 0.

226
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,740
I know this is messy.

227
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,960
So then you get b squared
over a squared x squared

228
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,010
is equal to b squared.

229
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,535
You could divide both sides
by b squared, I guess.

230
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,600
You get a 1 and a 1.

231
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,250
And then you could multiply
both sides by a squared.

232
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,875
You get x squared is equal to
a squared, and then you get

233
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:33,270
x is equal to the plus or
minus square root of a.

234
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,310
So this point right here is the
point a comma 0, and this point

235
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,860
right here is the point
minus a comma 0.

236
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,936
Now let's go back to
the other problem.

237
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,600
I have a feeling I might
be running out of time.

238
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,920
So notice that when the x term
was positive, our hyperbola

239
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,250
opened to the right
and the left.

240
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,660
And you could probably get from
detective reasoning that when

241
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,850
the y term is positive, which
is the case in this one, we're

242
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,810
probably going to
open up and down.

243
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,780
And let's just prove
that to ourselves.

244
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,240
So let's solve for y.

245
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,730
You get y squared
over b squared.

246
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,750
We're going to add x squared
over a squared to both sides.

247
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,910
So you get equals x squared
over a squared plus 1.

248
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,960
Multiply both sides
by b squared.

249
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,310
y squared is equal to b
squared over a squared x

250
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,815
squared plus b squared.

251
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,970
You have to distribute
the b squared.

252
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,500
Now take the square root.

253
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,020
I'll switch colors for that.

254
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,260
So y is equal to the plus
or minus square root of b

255
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,150
squared over a squared x
squared plus b squared.

256
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,170
And once again-- I've run out
of space-- we can make that

257
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,640
same argument that as x
approaches positive or negative

258
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,140
infinity, this equation, this
b, this little constant term

259
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,630
right here isn't going
to matter as much.

260
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,800
You're just going to
take the square root of

261
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,300
this term right here.

262
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,300
Which essentially b over a x,
plus or minus b over a x.

263
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,790
And once again, those are the
same two asymptotes, which

264
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,170
I'll redraw here, that
line and that line.

265
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,610
But in this case, we're
always a little bit larger

266
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,390
than the asymptotes.

267
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,640
   

268
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,810
So in the positive quadrant,
that tells us we're going to

269
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,330
be up here and down there.

270
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,430
Another way to think about it,
in this case, when the

271
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,510
hyperbola is a vertical
hyperbola, where it opens up

272
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,730
and down, you notice x could be
equal to 0, but y could

273
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,280
never be equal to 0.

274
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,250
And that makes sense, too.

275
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,735
Because if you look at our
original formula right here,

276
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,060
x could be equal to 0.

277
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,940
If x was 0, this would
cancel out and you

278
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,250
could just solve for y.

279
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,670
But if y were equal to 0, you'd
have minus x squared over a

280
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,700
squared is equal to 1, and then
you would have, if you solved

281
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,950
this, you'd get x squared is
equal to minus a squared.

282
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,340
And we're not dealing with
imaginary numbers, so you can't

283
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,740
square something, you can't
get a negative number.

284
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,110
So once again, this
would be impossible.

285
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,490
So that's this other clue that
tells you it opens up and down.

286
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,600
Because in this case y
could never equal 0.

287
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,690
Anyway, you might be a little
confused because I stayed

288
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,560
abstract with the
b's and the a's.

289
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,770
In the next couple of videos
I'll do a bunch of problems

290
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,490
where we draw a bunch of
hyperbolas, ellipses, and

291
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,840
circles with actual numbers.

292
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,342
See you soon.

293
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:33,452
