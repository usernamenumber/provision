1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,130
Welcome

3
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:01,400
back.

4
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,350
We're ready to do part
D, and let me copy and

5
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,990
paste that in as well.

6
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,210
   

7
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,330
See, I don't think that's going
to need this graph, so let

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,290
me just remove that with a
color other than yellow.

9
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:23,750
   

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,150
It's copy and pasted.

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,610
I don't know if you can read
it, but it's helpful for me

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,060
to review the problem
on our clipboard.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,430
OK.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:42,010
The rate at which tickets were
sold for t -- for over this

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,120
range is modeled by r of t--
let me write that in case you

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,270
can't see it-- is the rate at
which tickets were sold. r of t

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:56,320
is equal to 550 te to the minus
t over 2 tickets per hour.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,590
Based on the model, how many
tickets were sold by 3:00 PM?

19
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,480
So my t equals 3-- to the
nearest whole number?

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,650
So that's sometimes important.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,980
You don't want to give
a decimal answer.

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,790
So this is the rate at
which tickets are sold.

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,020
So this is the derivative
of the total tickets

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,940
sold function.

25
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,870
Or another way that we could
write it is the total tickets

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,600
sold-- so let's call that, I
don't know, capital T sub--

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,740
well let me-- I don't want to
do T of t, that's

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,490
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

29
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,150
So let's say the tickets sold
as a function of time is going

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,547
to be equal to the definite
integral-- well, we could say

31
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:45,260
is at any time t, the tickets
sold-- and this is the

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,680
fundamental theorems calculus,
I think it might be one of its

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,500
correlaries or actually
sometimes it is the fundamental

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,810
theorem of calculus, I always
forget my definitions.

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,340
Between time equals 0 and t--
or if we want to know the

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,260
tickets sold, between time
equals 0 and t is equal to the

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,580
integral of the rate at which
the tickets sold was changing.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:13,970
So that's equal to 550te
to the minus t over 2dt.

39
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,210
Right?

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,020
That's it.

41
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,180
And so if we want to know how
many tickets were sold at time

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,120
equals 3, that's just equal to
the definite integral from 0 to

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,520
3, or we could also view it as
the area under this curve, from

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,390
time equals 0 to time equal to
3 of 550te to the

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,640
minus t over 2dt.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,990
Now this integral right here,
you can solve it analytically

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,120
using integration of parts,
which I just called the reverse

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,840
product rule, but you only have
45 minutes to do all three of

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,980
these problems, and they'll let
you use your graphing

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,050
calculator, and your graphic
calculator is excellent at

51
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,210
doing definite integrals, and
they just want the

52
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,180
number, right?

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,210
So let's use our graphic
calculators to get that number.

54
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,350
Let's see.

55
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:06,090
I don't want to copy,
so how do we do that?

56
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,320
We just do second the division
button but that's calc--

57
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,620
definite, let me use the
definite integral, and like

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,790
what was, let's see, let me
make sure I have that--

59
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,560
550 let's just use x.

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:37,180
550 times x times second e to
the minus x divided by 2.

61
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,220
I think that's the
whole function.

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,730
And let's see.

63
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,610
My independent variable is x,
I've just swapped t for x

64
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:53,060
there, and I'm taking the
integral from 0 to 3.

65
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,590
   

66
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,520
Click enter, let the
calculator do the work.

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,720
This would have taken you quite
a while if you had to actually

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,140
do the integral yourself.

69
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,810
972.78, and they want
us to round to the

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,030
nearest whole number.

71
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,770
So the nearest whole
number is 973.

72
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:18,840
So we say 973 tickets
sold by 3:00 PM.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,490
And we're done.

74
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,970
That only took us four minutes.

75
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,230
And it would have taken us
even less if we didn't

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,130
have to explain it.

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,020
Anyway.

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,840
I will see you in
problem number three.
