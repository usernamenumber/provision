1
00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:07,094
We're given that angle ADB is congruent to angle ADC, so let me write that down.

2
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:14,362
So angle ADB, so that's this angle right over here, they're telling us that that's congruent to angle ADC,

3
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:17,732
ADC, so that's this angle right over there.

4
00:00:17,732 --> 00:00:29,401
They also tell also tell us that angle BAD, angle BAD, angle BAD, angle BAD, so that's this angle, I'll do it with two arcs because it's not necessarily the same measure as this one here,

5
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:37,877
So angle BAD is congruent to angle CAD, that's angle CAD, so this is this angle right over here.

6
00:00:37,877 --> 00:00:47,685
Prove that triangle BAD, triangle BAD, this is the triangle on the left, is congruent to triangle CAD, that's this triangle on the right.

7
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:55,761
And so they, they give the givens here, angle BAD is congruent to CAD, BAD is congruent to CAD, well they've already told us that,

8
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:59,729
And they also told us that angle ADB is congruent to ADC,

9
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:03,666
ADB is congruent to ADC, so we've already marked that up.

10
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,754
So how do we prove this?

11
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:12,970
Well the one thing we know, and this is almost intuitively obvious, is that the measure of this segment is equal to itself.

12
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:21,119
And the reason why that's a useful thing to state explicitly is because that side, this segment AD, is part of both triangles.

13
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,995
So let's just mark that there. It's equal to itself, so let me write that here.

14
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:31,863
And the reason why it's useful is because you're kind of saying: "Hey look,this is a side on both of those triangles that we care about."

15
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:40,847
So we could write AD is congruent to AD, and it be by the reflexive property, which is the most obvious property, that something is going to be equal to itself.

16
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:52,992
So, reflexive property, there you go. But now, by stating that we've explicitly put up enough information in our proof to now say that the left triangle is congruent to the right,

17
00:01:52,992 --> 00:01:58,944
and the reason why we can say that is we have a corresponding angle, corresponding side, and another corresponding angle,

18
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:02,185
which is congruent to this angle, this side, and ths angle

19
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:06,306
And we talked about in other videos about why Angle Side Agnle works,

20
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:11,884
If I have one triangle, that has congruent one angle, a side, and another angle that's congruent to another triangle,

21
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:16,189
it's impossible for me to draw a triangle that is not congruent.

22
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,592
This is a basic axiom which we assume, it's a basic assumption. So now we have enough information.

23
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:27,951
We can now write that triangle BAD, triangle BAD, and we want to make sure we have the corresponding side,

24
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:32,473
So, what corresponds to angle B, or vertex B right over here,

25
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:38,991
is C, so it's going to be C, and then we want to go to A, and then D, to it's going to be CAD.

26
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:42,166
And the reason is we have an angle, a side, and an angle.

27
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:46,423
So let me get it, Angle Side Angle congruence.

28
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:49,688
There you go, and I think we are done, let's see how we did.

29
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:53,000
There you go.
