1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,800
In this video, I want to show
some examples of graphing

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,620
quadratic functions.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,790
But before I do that, I want
to make one fairly minor

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,260
correction to the end of the
last video where we did some

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,880
factoring with grouping.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,350
When I showed you the proof of
why that works, I multiplied

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:24,180
fx plus g times hx plus j.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,020
When I multiplied them, I
did the first term, I

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,280
said fx times hx.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,530
When I did it in the last
video, I just wrote fhx.

12
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,980
And we know that that's not
true, we have f times h

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,050
times x times x.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,950
It's fhx squared.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,690
That times that is fhx squared
and then the rest of it I had

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:51,200
gotten right, it's fx times j,
so plus we get fjx and then we

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,110
had g times hx so we could
write that as plus ghx.

18
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,300
And then finally g times
j, which gives us gj.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,330
So I apologize for that error,
I had forgotten to write the

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,660
exponent there and I think I'd
forgotten to write it in the

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,580
step after that, but it didn't
change the argument for the

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,370
proof, I at least didn't
mess up there.

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,810
So I just want to make that
quick correction in case that

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,635
confused anyone.

25
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:16,340
And I also made a small
annotation in that video if

26
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,890
you're watching it on YouTube.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,130
With that out of the way, let's
learn to graph some of

28
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,260
these quadratic functions.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,020
So let's say I have the function
y is equal to x

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,820
squared minus 2x minus 8.

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,910
And what we're going to do is
we're going to rewrite this

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,860
quadratic expression on
the right-hand side.

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,410
We're going to write it
in intercept form.

34
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,860
That essentially means
just writing it

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,470
in it factored form.

36
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,390
Then doing that, we're able to
figure out the x-intercept,

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,950
where we're intersecting the
x-access, and then using that

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,370
we'll be able to figure
out the vertex.

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,110
And I'll show you you what the
vertex is in a second.

40
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,800
So let's just factor
this quadratic on

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,680
the right-hand side.

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,720
So we get y is equal to-- so
what are two numbers where

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,090
their product is a negative 8,
so they're going to have

44
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,310
different signs and then their
difference is negative 2?

45
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,889
Let's see, if we have a negative
4, and plus 2.

46
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,915
When you take the product, you
get negative 8, when you add

47
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:16,160
them, you get negative 2.

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,010
So we could rewrite y as being
equal to x minus 4

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,090
times x plus 2.

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,910
So this is essentially writing
this quadratic function in

51
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,490
intercept form.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,870
And now let's figure out where
this intersects the x-axis So

53
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,580
let me label my axis.

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,210
This is, of course, the x-axis,
that is the y-axis.

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,580
So when will something
intersect the x-axis?

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,090
The x-axis is when y is
equal to 0, right?

57
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,270
So let's set this equal to 0.

58
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,390
0 is equal to x minus
4 times x plus 2.

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,690
We've seen this multiple times
before, this means that either

60
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,500
x minus 4 or x plus 2 or both of
them have to be equal to 0.

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,490
So x minus four is equal to 0
or x plus two is equal to 0.

62
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,670
So that means x could be equal
to 4-- we're just adding 4 to

63
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,790
both sides of that equation--
or subtracting 2 from both

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,230
sides of this equation, x could
be equal to negative 2.

65
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,350
So these points where we
intersect, when x is 4, this

66
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,840
term is 0 so the whole
thing is 0.

67
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,390
That's how we solved for this.

68
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:31,850
So the points 4, 0, and the
point 2, 0 are going to both

69
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,030
be on this parabola.

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,510
So let's graph them.

71
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,280
So 4, 0-- let me do this in a
darker color-- 1, 2 3, 4,

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,210
that's 4, 0.

73
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,810
And then the other point
is negative 2, 0.

74
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,200
1, 2 negative 2, 0
is right there.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,960
So that's the two points where
we intersect the x-axis.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,900
And now we're going to determine
something called the

77
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,980
vertex of our parabola.

78
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,400
And the vertex, just to give you
a sneak preview, parabolas

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,930
are the graphs of quadratic
functions and so the graphic

80
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,740
is going to look either like an
upward u or a downward u,

81
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,760
and it's going to be shifted
around on this.

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,839
But the vertex is either
this minimum point or

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,110
this maximum point.

84
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,750
And the word parabola just
describes this function shape.

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,090
It's the shape of the graph
of a quadratic.

86
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,560
Let me write that word down,
these are parabolas.

87
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,630
   

88
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,045
So to figure out the vertex,
you actually just take the

89
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,520
x-value that's halfway in
between the two intercepts.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,700
No matter what, the intercepts
are going to be equidistant

91
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,950
from the vertex.

92
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,980
   

93
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,980
So if that is the graph, those
would be our intercepts and

94
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,300
then our vertex is going to be
an x-value exactly halfway

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,520
between them.

96
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,620
So to figure out the x-value of
our vertex, we just average

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,330
these two x-values of
our x-intercepts.

98
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,770
So let's do that.

99
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,250
We could say the x for the
vertex, let's call that x for

100
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,910
the vertex-- that's why I wrote
a v there-- is going to

101
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,840
be equal to the average
of these.

102
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,290
So 4 plus negative 2 over 2.

103
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,810
Which is equal to this 4 minus
2, which is 2 over

104
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,590
2 is equal to 1.

105
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,540
So x is going to be equal
to 1 and what is y when

106
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,970
x is equal to 1?

107
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,480
So the y for the vertex is
going to be equal to 1

108
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,500
squared-- I'll just write that
as 1-- minus 2 times 1, so

109
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,800
minus 2, minus 8.

110
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,510
So what is this?

111
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,230
This is 1 minus 10, which
is equal to negative 9.

112
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,090
So the vertex is going to be
at the point 1, negative 9.

113
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,830
So we go one and then
we go down nine.

114
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,010
So x is 1 and then
y is negative 9.

115
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

116
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,010
So it's right there.

117
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,010
And so if we were to graph this
parabola, the line of

118
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,330
symmetry is on the x-value
of the vertex.

119
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,680
So, I want to be doing it in
a darker color than that.

120
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
So the graph should be symmetric
around x is equal to

121
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,000
1, and the graph will look
something like this.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,300
I'll try my best to draw it.

123
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,555
Bam!

124
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,990
It'll intersect the x-axis
there, it'll be symmetric,

125
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,940
it'll look just like that
on the other side.

126
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,950
And it'll go bam,
just like that.

127
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,660
I think you get the
general idea.

128
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,620
And then the other point that
you may or may not be

129
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,760
interested in is the
actual y-intercept.

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,250
If x is equal to 0, you
immediately see that y is

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,280
equal to negative 8.

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,270
So the point 0, negative 8
should also be on this graph.

133
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,510
Let's see if I drew it right.

134
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,520
0, negative eight right there
should also be on that graph.

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,770
Let's do another one of these.

136
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,030
   

137
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,810
I'm kind of taking up some
of the space for the next

138
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,110
problem, so let me clear this.

139
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,200
Let's do another one.

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,550
All right.

141
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:14,170
So let's say we have y is
equal to 2x squared

142
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:20,510
plus 6x plus 4.

143
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,150
So here, the thing that
immediately jumps out at me is

144
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,860
that I can factor a 2
out of everything.

145
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,210
So I could rewrite this as y is
equal to 2 times x squared

146
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,080
plus 3x plus 2.

147
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,170
That saves me the pain of having
to do the factoring by

148
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,500
grouping that we talked about
in the last video.

149
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,830
And this we can factor in a
pretty straightforward way.

150
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,330
This is 2 times 1 is 2, 2 plus
1 is 3, so this is x plus 2

151
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,220
times x plus 1, right?

152
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,590
2 plus 1 is 3, 2 times 1 is 2.

153
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,710
So that's what y is equal to.

154
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,500
So if we wanted to know the
x-intercepts, we figure out

155
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,880
where this expression is equal
to 0, so we said 0 is equal to

156
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,180
2 times x plus 2
times x plus 1.

157
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,150
Remember, we want to figure
out where we intercept the

158
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,020
x-axis, that's the
x-axis there.

159
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,250
Y is 0 on the x-axis.

160
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,710
   

161
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,050
So let's get back
to this problem.

162
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,220
So either of these can
be equal to 0.

163
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,170
Obviously the 2 can't be equal
to 0, so we get the situation

164
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:34,510
where x minus x plus 2 is equal
to 0 or x plus 1 is

165
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,190
equal to 0.

166
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,110
I didn't have to write the
parentheses there.

167
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,890
Subtract 2 from both sides of
this equation, we get x is

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,340
equal to negative 2.

169
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,250
Subtract 1 from both sides of
this question or x could be

170
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,650
equal to negative 1.

171
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,740
So the point negative 2, 0.

172
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,930
You put negative 2 here, this
is obviously going to make y

173
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,300
equal to 0 and the point
negative 1, 0, same argument.

174
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,050
Those are our x-intercepts.

175
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,230
Let me graph it.

176
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,340
We have negative 2,
0 right there.

177
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,120
Actually let me do this graph
a little bit bigger.

178
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,900
Let's say that this is right
here is-- let me label it-- in

179
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,120
double steps.

180
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,050
So let's say this is negative 1,
let's say this is negative

181
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:28,200
2, that is negative 3,
1, 2, this is our 3.

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,640
It's a 1, 2, 3 just like that,
negative 1, negative 2,

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,800
negative 3.

184
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,390
So, I'm using two blocks
to represent one.

185
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,900
So the point negative 2, 0
is on our graph, with our

186
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,570
x-intercept, so negative
2, 0 is right there.

187
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,200
And then we have negative 1,
0, which is right there.

188
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,330
And then we want to figure
out the vertex.

189
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,900
Well, the vertex is going to be
the average of those two,

190
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,330
so the x for the vertex is going
to be negative 2 plus

191
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,940
negative 1 over 2, that's
negative 3/2 which is the same

192
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,590
thing is negative 1.5.

193
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,720
Now what is y equal to when
x is negative 1.5?

194
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,270
This is going to be a
little bit involved.

195
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll use actual 3/2.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,390
So so we get y is equal to 2
times negative 3/2 squared

197
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,720
plus 6 times negative
3/2 plus 4.

198
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,310
And let us figure this out.

199
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,090
So this is equal to 2 times 9
over 4 minus-- you have that

200
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,950
negative sign there-- and then
we could make this 6 divided

201
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,720
by 2 is just the same
thing is 3/1.

202
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,890
So this is minus 9,
3 times 3 plus 4.

203
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:49,930
This 2/4 the same thing as
1/2, so this becomes 9/2

204
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,820
minus 9 plus 4.

205
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,240
So let's simplify this.

206
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,290
Minus 9 plus 4 is the same
thing as minus 5, right?

207
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,990
Minus 9 plus 4.

208
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,010
Minus 5 we can rewrite is
equal to minus 10/2.

209
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,520
9 minus 10, all of that
over 2, is minus 1/2.

210
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,390
So, our vertex of this parabola
is the point minus

211
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,250
1.5 or negative 1.5,
negative 1/2.

212
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,980
This is our vertex, so we
can graph it right here.

213
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,240
Negative 1.5, negative
1/2, our vertex

214
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
is right over there.

215
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,100
And then we can a graph
this parabola.

216
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,850
If we want to do the
y-intercept, we can.

217
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,120
The y-intercept is going
to be here when x is 0,

218
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,190
y is equal to 4.

219
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,720
These terms cancel out.

220
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,120
X is 0, y is 1, 2, 3,
4 right over there.

221
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,100
And then we can graph
this parabola.

222
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,030
It will look like that, that's
my best, it should be

223
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,720
symmetric around x-coordinate of
the vertex just like that.

224
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,480
Let's do one more of these.

225
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,920
And, once again, I've used all
my real estate up, let me

226
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,310
clear this out of the way.

227
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,760
Let's do one more.

228
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,130
Let's say that I have y is equal
to negative x squared

229
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,640
plus 10x minus 21.

230
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,290
Once again, let's write this
in intercept form, we just

231
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,940
factor the right-hand side.

232
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,276
We get y is equal to-- well the
first thing I want to do

233
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,580
is it is factor this negative
1 out-- negative 1 times x

234
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,770
squared minus 10x plus 21.

235
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,400
Now what two numbers, when
I multiply them, they're

236
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,550
positive 21?

237
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,860
So they have to be the same
side, and when I add them I

238
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,080
get negative 10.

239
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,130
At least in my brain, negative
7 and negative 3 jump out.

240
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,390
I mean, there's not that many
factors of 21, so 7 and 3 are

241
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,630
probably two that usually jump
out because they add to 10.

242
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:52,590
So you have y is equal to
negative 1 times x minus 3

243
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,920
times x minus 7.

244
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,590
Negative 3 plus negative 7 is
negative 10, negative 3 times

245
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,500
negative 7 is positive 21.

246
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,280
So if you want to find the
x-intecepts, the x-intercepts

247
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,390
are going to be where-- so we
could set this whole equation

248
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,400
equal to 0, negative 1 times x
minus 3 times x minus 7 are

249
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,900
x-intercepts or the x-values
that make y equal to 0 are

250
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,090
either the ones that make x
minus 3 equal to 0 or the

251
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,100
x-values that make x
minus 7 equal to 0.

252
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,660
Add 3 to both sides of this
equation, you got x is equal

253
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,940
to 3, add 7 to both sides of
this equation, you get x is

254
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,830
equal to 7.

255
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,150
So so we get our two
x-intercepts, the point 3, 0--

256
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:44,440
1, 2, 3, 0-- and the point 7,
0-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- 0.

257
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,790
Now, we know that our vertex
is going to be right in

258
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,830
between them.

259
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:53,000
So the x for the vertex is going
to be 3 plus 7 over 2,

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,130
which is equal to 10/2,
which is equal to 5.

261
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,370
And to the y-value, let's
figure it out, y for our

262
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:07,540
vertex going to be negative 5
squared, so negative 25 plus

263
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:14,080
10 times 5 plus 50 minus 21.

264
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,850
So what is this?

265
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,380
This is equal to-- we have a
negative 25 and negative 21,

266
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,680
you add those together you
get a negative 46.

267
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,780
Add that to 50, you get
y is equal to 4.

268
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,450
So the vertex is at 5, 4.

269
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,070
Let me graph that, the
vertex is 5, 4.

270
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,160
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right
in between.

271
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,610
And then up four, 1, 2, 3, 4.

272
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,940
So notice something, in this
graph over here, the last two

273
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,240
graphs, actually I think I just
cleared them, you saw

274
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,810
that the vertex was
below the x-axis.

275
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,450
So, when we plotted the
x-intercept and then the

276
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,590
vertex, the upward-forming
u-shape was the only option.

277
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,810
But here, the only option
is a downward u-shape.

278
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,460
This being either the minimum or
maximum point and going for

279
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,200
both of these points and having
a u-shape, our u-shape

280
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,450
is going to have to look
something like this.

281
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,180
Now,-- let me draw that little
bit better-- the u is going to

282
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,530
have to look something
like that.

283
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,070
That's a better shot at it.

284
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,100
Now notice what was the
difference between this

285
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,240
equation and the
previous ones?

286
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,580
The difference was is that this
one had a negative in

287
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,100
front of the x squared.

288
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,850
The coefficient in front
of the x squared

289
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,970
was a negative number.

290
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,190
And that's why we have kind of
a downward opening parabola.

291
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,130
If this was a positive number,
we would have an

292
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,380
upward-opening parabola.

293
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,760
So that's why this one is kind
of a downward shape and its

294
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,140
vertex represents
a maximum point.

295
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,310
It's the highest point
on the parabola.

296
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,840
In the previous videos, we had
an upward opening, or in the

297
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,330
previous problems, with an
upward-opening parabola and

298
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,930
our vertex was the
minimum point.

299
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,066
