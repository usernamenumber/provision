1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,060
All the parabolic mirror examples we've been doing so far have been concave

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,780
And that just means--you might know already what concave means

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,590
but just to make it clear

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,440
They were opening out towards the objects

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,290
and in most of the cases out towards where the images were formed

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,470
So we cared about the inside surface of the mirror right here

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,030
The way I always remember concave. It kind of forms a cave

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,290
We can view this part right here as the inside of the cave and we had a bunch of examples

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,300
where we had focal points

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,690
and then here was our principal axis and we had objects

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,170
and I showed you how the light would reflect off of the mirror

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,200
and go through the focal point

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,390
So we did a bunch of examples like that in the last couple of videos

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,980
In this video, I want to do a quick example of using a convex parabolic mirror

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,310
Convex parabolic mirror

16
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,720
and here we care about the other side of the mirror

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,910
we care about kind of the outside of the bowl

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:24,620
Let's imagine once again, you have something that's the shape of a parabola

19
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:32,420
This is the principal axis right over here. That is the line of symmetry

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,860
This is still the focal point. That right there is still the focus

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:44,130
The reflective surface is on the outside

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,570
So the reflective surfaces kind jutting out towards us

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,900
as opposed to caving in

24
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,800
That's another way to remember. Concave looks like it's caved in

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,430
Here it's jutting out towards us

26
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,250
Let's think about what would happen if I put an object over here on the outside

27
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,510
assuming that this is a reflective surface

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,540
If I put an object here, what is going to happen?

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,330
Let's just do the same exercise. What we're gonna do is

30
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,650
we're gonna have one parallel ray--

31
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,470
we can do rays in any direction from any of these points because

32
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,710
there's some light source over here

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,410
I never draw the light source, but it reflects diffusely off of this object

34
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,650
So this object is emitting light rays in every direction, but the useful ones

35
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,690
the useful diffuse light rays being emitted by this object

36
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,440
are the ones that are parallel to the principal axis

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,170
and the ones that would you go through the focus

38
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,910
Let's do one that's parallel to the principal axis. I'm not doing the math over here

39
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,130
but if it reflects off of the outside of this parabolic mirror

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,010
it will reflect away like it's coming from the focus

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,660
The focus is on the other side of this mirror

42
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,120
but it would reflect away that would look like it's coming from the focus

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,180
So that ray will reflect like that

44
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,090
And then if we have another ray from the head of this object, from the tip of that arrow

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,400
and that ray is going in the direction of the focus

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,730
So the focus is there. Let me draw the direction

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,850
So I have an incident ray going in the direction of the focus

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,810
When that gets reflected, it will reflect parallel to the principal axis

49
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,800
So it will reflect parallel to the principal axis

50
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,270
And so what type of image is going to be formed here?

51
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,150
Clearly these two rays will never converge. So we can't form a real image

52
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,920
We can not project that image onto a screen or cloth and see it

53
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,780
These two rays are converging but

54
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,050
if one were to observe the rays, they look like they're diverging from a single point

55
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,060
This ray that just got reflected out parallel looks like it's coming from

56
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,950
if you go straight back behind the mirror

57
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,710
And this one is coming out; looks like it's coming out of this point there

58
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:08,340
So it looks like they're diverging from this point on the other side of the mirror

59
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,660
Not only does it look like that they're coming from there

60
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,780
but the actual image will look like that

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,010
We can do it with other points on this arrow if we want

62
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,660
You can take the bottom of the arrow; that's maybe the easiest

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:28,870
Light that goes straight to the actual mirror will then get reflected straight back

64
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:35,020
So it would look like it's coming from a point behind the mirror, back over here

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,580
We can do other things. We can draw a stuff so you can see the whole image

66
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,840
You can take points over here and you say that would correspond to a point over there

67
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,860
But the thing that hopefully you'll realize from this video

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,570
is when you're dealing with a convex parabolic mirror

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,550
where the outside is the reflective surface

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,570
you're not going to form a real image; you're going to form a virtual image

71
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,370
This is a virtual image just like you'd see in your bathroom mirror

72
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,730
That's probably not parabolic I'm guessing

73
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,630
It's also going to be a smaller image

74
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,950
And you see this type of mirrors all the time, especially around corners

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,970
If you see a corner--let me draw corners

76
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:29,470
you'll sometimes see mirrors out here

77
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,290
so that you can see people as they're coming around the corner

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,590
The reason why these mirrors are useful is that they reflect light from a lot of directions

79
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,640
So you can kind of see around corners

80
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,230
This is not the best drawing. But I think you've seen these convex mirrors

81
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,630
mirrors that look something like this

82
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,760
Sometimes you'll also see them in the head of the aisles of stores and this is the way

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,580
the storeowners can have a good field of view and they can see if anyone is shoplifting

84
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,890
Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting
