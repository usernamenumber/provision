1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
We're on problem 20.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,980
Of the 5 coordinates associated with points A,B,

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,760
C,D and E on the number line above,

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,430
which has the greatest absolute value? OK.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,270
Let me just draw the number line that they drew.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,890
And they say from 0 to 1.0,1,2.

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,780
And then they say minus 1,minus 2.

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,470
And then they say these are choices A,B,C,D,and E.

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,600
Of the 5 coordinates associated with the points A,

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,210
B,C,D,and E on the number line above,

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,960
which has the greatest absolute value?

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,150
So you can view absolute value as the distance from zero

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,670
So the greatest distance from zero is going to

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,680
happen in two places.It's going to happen here at A.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,150
It's also going to happen here at E.

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,380
Can you have more than one right answer?

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,980
Because both of those are choices.Let's see.

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,950
Indicate the best of the answer choices given.

19
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,370
I'm looking up the thing.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,980
Is it possible to have more than one right answer?

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,080
Because this doesn't seem quite right that

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,100
I can have two possible answers for this one.

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,750
The answer is A.

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,580
The coordinate A is the farthest from zero.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,740
This has the greatest absolute value.I disagree with that.

26
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,370
It could be choice E as well.

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,780
The absolute value of the number x is the distance

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,950
between x and 0 on the number line.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,900
The coordinate of point A is the farthest from 0,

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,110
and thus has the greatest absolute value.That's false.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean,that's true,but E is just as far.

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,400
I don't know,I think they made a mistake.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,570
I think this could be choices A or E,

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,680
because the absolute value of either of those is 2.

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,690
I think they made a mistake.

36
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,010
And they say the choice is A,which I agree with,

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,550
but it could just as easily be choice E.So I don't know.

38
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,710
Write a letter to GMAT.

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,440
I mean,this seems pretty straightforward.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,980
Of the 5 coordinates associated with choices A,B,

41
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,370
C,D,and E on the number line,

42
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,020
which has the greatest absolute value?

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,830
The absolute value of this point is 2.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,260
The absolute value of this point is 2.They're equal.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,960
Anyway.Next problem.I think it should be A or E.

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,660
It's surprising that they would let a question like that

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,180
get through their screen.

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,830
Or at least they should get rid of choice E.

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,190
If x and y are prime numbers,

50
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,920
which of the following cannot be the sum of x and y?

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,670
x plus y cannot equal what? So statement 1: 5.

52
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,420
Well,I can immediately say 2 plus 3 is equal to 5.

53
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,530
So that doesn't work.Cannot equal,so B.

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,080
9,I could do 2 plus 7 is equal to 9.This was A.This is B.

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,410
Let's see what C is.So it's not B.C is 13.

56
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,750
So let me think.What could it be?

57
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,760
11 plus 2 is equal to 13,so it's not choice C.D.16.

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,250
The sum.So let me see,16.9 and 7.No.11 and 5.

59
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,220
11 plus 5 is equal to 16.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,410
So without even looking at E,

61
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,010
it's probably going to be E.E ,23.

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,680
Let me see if I can come up with two prime numbers that

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,780
add up to 23.19 and 4.No.Let's see.2 and 21.No.

64
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,600
First of all,we found examples for all of these,

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,760
so if you don't want to waste time on the GMAT,

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,110
you should already have chosen E and moved on by this point,

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,340
but we could just look through a bunch of prime numbers and

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,440
think if they can add up to 23,

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,460
but I can't think of any right at the moment.

70
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,770
And I feel pretty good that E is the answer,

71
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,010
because I was able to find prime numbers that added up to

72
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,930
all of the other four choices.Next question.22.

73
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,140
I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,750
If each of the following fractions were written as a

75
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,970
repeating decimal,which would have the longest sequence of

76
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,120
different digits? Are they going to sit here and make us--

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,000
so let me write all the choices down.

78
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,410
Maybe we can do some cancellation from the get-go.

79
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,570
2/11.B is 1/3.And we already know that that's just

80
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,820
going to be 0.33 repeating.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Longest sequence of different digits.

82
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,000
So it's not going to be choice B because choice B

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
doesn't have different digits.

84
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,620
It just keeps being a 3,so it's not going to be choice B,

85
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,930
so we don't have to worry about that.Choice C.41/99.

86
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,930
Choice D is 2/3.We know that that's 0.666.

87
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,720
It just keeps going.So it's not going to be that.

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,310
It's the same digit that just keeps repeating.

89
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:17,500
And choice E is 23 divided by 37.So 2 divided by 11 repeats.

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,960
Let's just try it,though.11 goes into 2.000 one time.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,930
1 times 11 is 11.You get a 90.11 goes into 90 eight times.

92
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,920
88.It's 20.I already see the pattern.

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,060
11 goes into 20 two times.Sorry,it goes into 20 one time.

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,280
1 times 11 is 11.Then you get a 90.

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,030
It goes into it eight times,so it's just 0.181818.

96
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,100
It's just going to keep repeating 0.18.

97
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,920
So that's 2/11.41/99.

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,300
Let me do it in a different color just so I

99
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,610
don't get too messy.99 goes into 41.0000.

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:05,630
So 99 goes into 410 four times.4 times 99 is what? 396.

101
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,060
4 times 9 is 6.3.4 times 9 is 36.Yep,396.

102
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,540
This is equal to 140.99 goes into 140 one time.

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,490
1 times 99 is 99.This becomes 41.

104
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,030
Already started repeating,right? 99 goes into 410.

105
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,820
That's just like that.

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,780
So it's going to be 0.41 repeating over and over again

107
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,580
because we got the same number again.

108
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,450
We're going 99 into 41 four times.We're going to get 396

109
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:37,580
and it's just going to keep happening.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,590
Then we're going to get 396.

111
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,380
And then we're going to get 140 again.It's 41,41.

112
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,380
So it's 41 repeating.

113
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,840
So if I had to guess,it's already going to be choice E,

114
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
without having to do any work because these just have the

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,220
same numbers repeating from the get-go.

116
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,750
Choices A and C have the same two numbers

117
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,890
repeating from the get-go.

118
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,660
So I'm guessing that this one has a lot more.

119
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,090
So if you just wanted to worry about time,

120
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,390
you could just pick E and move on.

121
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,720
But let's do it just to prove to ourselves.

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
So 37 goes into 23.

123
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,540
I don't remember when I took the GMAT having to do this

124
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,020
much decimal division or decimal multiplication.

125
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,020
So 37 goes into 230.I don't know.

126
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,650
Does it go into it six times? No,probably five times.

127
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:36,840
5 times 7 is 35.5 times 3 is 15,so it's 18,plus 3.OK.

128
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,410
30.85.Actually,this would have gone six times.

129
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,450
Let me change that to 6.Let me to it in a different color.

130
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,650
I don't want to make it too messy.6 times 7 is 42.

131
00:07:50,200 --> 00:08:00,810
6 times 3 is 18,plus 4 is 22.80.37 goes into 80 two times.

132
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:13,070
2 times 37 is what? 74,right? 60 plus 14.74.You get a 60.

133
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,840
30 is going to go into 60.

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
So already we haven't even started repeating

135
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,110
and we're already three digits into it.

136
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,540
So this is going to have the longest sequence of

137
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,310
different digits.We don't have to keep going.

138
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,920
We've answered our question.The choice is definitely E.

139
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,320
Next question.They've drawn something there.

140
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,860
In the figure above the coordinates of point V are--well,

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,420
this is just kind of a reading the graph type of problem.

142
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm just going to draw this 4th quadrant just so that

143
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,380
I can show you how I think about it.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,610
OK,so let me just count: one,two,three,four,five; one,

145
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,090
two,three,four,five.

146
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,790
They tell us that each of those slashes are 1,

147
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,440
because they do it in a couple of places.

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,450
They go one,two,three,four,five,

149
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,840
and then they say this is negative 5.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
So that's information that you actually need.

151
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
You have to know that each of those slashes are definitely 1.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,930
But then on this,they go one,two,three,four,five,six,seven.

153
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,400
So they go one,two,three,four,five,six,seven,

154
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,850
so this is point 7.

155
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,700
And you have to just count it on your paper.

156
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,920
So this is one,two,three,four,five.

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,770
And this is point one,two,three,four,five.This is minus 5.

158
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,620
And this is where V is.

159
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,470
So they're just testing to see if you know

160
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,000
how to graph a point.So this is x is 7.And y is minus 5.

161
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,230
So it's 7 minus 5.And actually,that's interesting.

162
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,820
You don't even have to count the points,because you say,

163
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,190
you know what? This is in the 4th quadrant.x is positive.

164
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,440
y is negative.

165
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,710
And if you look at all the choices,there's only one

166
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,860
choice where x is positive and y is negative,

167
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,800
and that's choice E.

168
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,060
So you really didn't even have to count it,although I think

169
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,720
this wouldn't have taken much time to count it,

170
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,390
so that's not like a huge shortcut.

171
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,130
Anyway,see you in the next video.
