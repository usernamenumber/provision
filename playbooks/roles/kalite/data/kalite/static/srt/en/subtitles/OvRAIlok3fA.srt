1
00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:02,305
We're on problem --

2
00:00:02,305 --> 00:00:06,911
(Where are we?) -- problem 232.

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:07,842
Only a few left.

4
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:22,501
If 1/x - 1/( x + 1) is equal to 1/( x + 4),

5
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,046
then x could be which of the following?

6
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,102
And you might have a temptation to just invert both sides.

7
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:29,525
But you can't do that just yet.

8
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:30,637
Because if you took the inverse of this,

9
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:32,870
it's not like you just get x - (x + 1).

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,541
You actually have to subtract -- or you could say add --

11
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,616
these two fractions together. So let's do that.

12
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:39,476
So if we simplify this left-hand side,

13
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:43,781
a common denominator would be x × (x + 1).

14
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,207
And then the numerator would be -- let's see--

15
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:51,214
1/x is the same thing as x + 1 over this thing.

16
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,251
Right? Because that cancels out, and you get 1/x.

17
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:56,024
-- minus 1/(x+1).

18
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:59,011
That's the same thing as x/x(x + 1).

19
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,227
The x's would cancel out, [so] you get 1/(x + 1).

20
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:06,018
So [on] this left-hand side, the x's cancel out,

21
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:09,057
and you get 1 over--

22
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:13,012
(Well, we could just make that x squared + x. Right?)

23
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:14,451
So now, this simplifies to--

24
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,039
The left-hand side is 1/ x squared + x.

25
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:20,602
And the right-hand side is1/(x + 4).

26
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,176
And now we could invert both sides,

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,883
or just set the denominators equal to each other.

28
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,962
But let's just invert both. They're the same thing, actually.

29
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:28,485
So if you take the inverse of both sides, you get--

30
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:30,381
(And I'll switch colors, just randomly.)

31
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:36,007
-- x squared + x is equal to x + 4.

32
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,029
Let's subtract x from both sides.

33
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:41,026
You get x squared is equal to 4.

34
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:45,031
So, x is equal to +/-2.

35
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:46,496
And they say, "... then x could be ..."

36
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,962
Well, choice C is -2.

37
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:51,026
So that's one of the values that x could be.

38
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:56,006
Next question: [PROBLEM] 233.

39
00:01:56,006 --> 00:02:04,048
All right, they have

40
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:11,012
(1/2 to the -3 power) × (1/4 to the -2 power) × (1/16 to the -1 [power]).

41
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:13,075
The first thing I do when I see negative exponents --

42
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,025
just so they don't confuse me -- is that I just

43
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,034
invert all of the numbers.

44
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,090
So this is the same thing.

45
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,096
This is the exact same thing as equal to--

46
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:25,071
this is the same thing as 2 to the third power, right?

47
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,083
When you take something to a negative exponent, that's the

48
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:30,068
same thing as the inverse of that thing to the positive

49
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:32,083
exponent, so this is 2 to the third power.

50
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:39,019
This is × 4 squared × 16.

51
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:46,050
And so 2 to the third is 8 × 16 × 16, right?

52
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,083
That's 8 × 256.

53
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,025
And then-- oh, wait.

54
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,050
I'm going down the wrong path,

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,087
because they have it in a completely different format.

56
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:58,043
So actually, maybe I should look at the choices before I

57
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:02,030
continue these problems. So let me rewrite it.

58
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,009
So they all have it as -- you know, 1/2 to some power, 1/8

59
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,049
to some power, so let me rewrite this.

60
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,040
I went down the wrong road.

61
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,075
So let's write all of these as powers of 1/2.

62
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,080
So 1/2 to the minus 1/3, fine.

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,015
That's still 1/2 to the minus 1/3.

64
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,093
1/4, what is that?

65
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:23,062
1/4 is the same thing as 1/2 squared.

66
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:26,011
We're raising that to the minus 2.

67
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:31,025
And then 1/16, that's the same thing as 1/2 to the third

68
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:33,020
power is 1/8, so it's to the fourth power.

69
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,041
We're taking that to the negative 1.

70
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,033
And then this is-- we'll just use what we know about

71
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:41,033
exponent rules, and we've proven this in other Khan

72
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,096
Academy videos.

73
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:45,036
1/2 squared to the minus 2.

74
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:48,022
You can just multiply these exponents, so that's equal to

75
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:51,065
1/2 to the minus 4.

76
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:56,018
And then 1/2 to the 4 to the minus 1, you multiply them and

77
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,018
that's equal to minus 4.

78
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:00,080
And now we have the same base, and we're multiplying them, so

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,000
we can just add the exponents.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,041
This is equal to 1/2 to the minus 3 plus minus 4, minus 7,

81
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,052
minus 4, is equal to minus 11.

82
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:17,031
So it's 1/2 to the negative 11th power, which is choice B.

83
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,031
That was a good lesson there.

84
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,054
Look at your choices before you go down some path because

85
00:04:20,054 --> 00:04:22,027
I was actually going to evaluate this thing, which

86
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,099
would have taken a little bit of extra time.

87
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:30,000
PROBLEM 234.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,080
In a certain game, a large container is filled with red,

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,031
yellow, green-- so let's see, there's red, yellow, green,

90
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,098
and blue beads, worth respectively-- so respectively

91
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,019
means the same order; we said the colors are in the same

92
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:52,044
order that they're worth -- so worth respectively 7, 5, 3,

93
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:54,083
and 2 points each.

94
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:58,029
OK, a number of beads are then removed from the container.

95
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:03,045
If the product of the point of values of the removed beads is

96
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:10,000
147,000, how many red beads were removed?

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,085
So this is interesting.

98
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,031
So there's something that hopefully will jump out at you

99
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,080
about these numbers.

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,023
They're all prime numbers, right?

101
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,038
So if you look at any number, you can tell how many of a

102
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:21,079
certain prime number there is in that number by just doing a

103
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,031
prime factorization.

104
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:28,031
So let's do that for 147,000.

105
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:30,056
And you'd be surprised how quickly a

106
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,007
number can get smaller.

107
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,032
So let's see.

108
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,018
How many times-- let's see, does 3 go 147?

109
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,080
I think we've done this before.

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,005
Sure, 3 times -- let me just do it up here.

111
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:47,020
3 goes into 147 4, 12, 27, 49 times.

112
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,041
So you get a 3 and you get a 49, right?

113
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,070
49,000, I should say.

114
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:59,037
You could do a 7 and a 7,000.

115
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:07,037
And then you can get another 7, and you can get a 1,000.

116
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:09,051
And then you could do 2 a bunch of times.

117
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:14,012
So you get a 2, you get a -- well, the main thing, just so

118
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:16,049
we don't waste time is they want to know--

119
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:17,052
(What color do they want to know?)

120
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:22,066
They want to know how many red beads were removed, right?

121
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,091
So, red corresponds to 7.

122
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,006
So all the beads, you multiply them

123
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,024
together and you get 147,000.

124
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:31,043
So we've essentially factored out all the 7's that we can

125
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,052
fit into 147,000.

126
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,044
7 does not go into 1,000 at all.

127
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:37,087
7 is not a factor.

128
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,012
So we've already solved our problem.

129
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:43,069
There are exactly two 7 prime factors in 147,000.

130
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,076
You could keep going with this.

131
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,041
You know, you get a 2.

132
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,081
2 × 500.

133
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:48,081
You get another 2.

134
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,099
2 × 250.

135
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,062
There's a bunch of 2's in here.

136
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:54,000
And then you'd probably get-- I don't know what else you're

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,037
going to get.

138
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:56,048
You'd probably get a couple of 5's in here, and

139
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,027
then you'd be done.

140
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,031
But these are all the 7's.

141
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:01,055
There are two 7's in 147,000.

142
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,063
Two 7 prime factors, so there would be 2 red beads.

143
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:06,061
And that is choice D.

144
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:13,031
PROBLEM 235.

145
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,075
([Let's] switch colors.)

146
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:17,080
[PROBLEM] 235.

147
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:25,018
If 2/(1 + 2/y) = 1,

148
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:27,075
then what does y equal?

149
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:29,045
Let's take the inverse
of both (sides of the equation).

150
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's multiply both sides of the equation times 1 + 2/y.

151
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,033
And so we get 2 = 1 + 2/y.

152
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:42,025
And let's multiply both sides of the equation by y.

153
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:45,024
So you get 2y--

154
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:47,274
And actually, you could probably already eyeball this.

155
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:48,128
Actually there's an easier way.

156
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,066
Let's subtract 1 from both sides.

157
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:52,033
You get 1 is equal to 2/y.

158
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:56,092
Multiply both sides by y, and you get y = 2.

159
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:59,030
And that is choice D.

160
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,039
And you could've actually eyeballed it, because, say,

161
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,047
1 + 1 = 2, so this has to be 1.

162
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,058
So how am I going to make that a 1?

163
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,038
That equals 2, but sometimes it's easier just to

164
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,012
mechanically go through the algebra, because sometimes,

165
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:10,047
you can't eyeball it, and it's good to

166
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:14,061
just keep moving forward.

167
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:19,012
PROBLEM 236.

168
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:27,010
If a, b, and c are consecutive positive integers, and a is

169
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:31,020
less than b, which is less than c, which of the following

170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,053
must be true?

171
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:38,051
Consecutive positive, so, you know, we could say that b

172
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:42,053
would be equal to a + 1, and c would be equal to a +

173
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:46,034
2 or b + 1.

174
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,074
And, of course, a is equal to a.

175
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,011
I don't know if that helps, I just felt like

176
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,022
writing that down.

177
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:54,072
So in statement 1, they say c minus a is equal to 2.

178
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:56,004
Sure.

179
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,046
They're consecutive positive integers, so c is going to be

180
00:08:58,046 --> 00:08:59,067
2 more than a.

181
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,003
So this is right.

182
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:04,000
Statement 2, they tell us abc is even.

183
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,063
Well, instead of going into some algebraic thing where I

184
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:11,038
represent even and odd integers and all of that,

185
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:14,059
let's just try it with two cases, one where a is odd and

186
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,082
one where a is even.

187
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:17,024
So let's say a is even.

188
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:22,016
So the numbers would be 2--

189
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,007
sorry, would be 2 × 3 × 4, right?

190
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:26,047
So then we would get 8.

191
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,025
Well, you know what?

192
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,050
This has to be even because one of these numbers are going

193
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,029
to be even, right?

194
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,050
And so if you're divisible, and by definition, if one of

195
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,049
these numbers are even, it's divisible by 2.

196
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:38,084
So the whole thing, when you multiply it together, it's got

197
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:40,052
to be divisible by 2, right?

198
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,083
Either a and c are even, in which case this whole thing

199
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:46,017
has to be even, or b is even, in which case this whole thing

200
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:46,075
is even, right?

201
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:50,037
If you multiply a string of numbers and at least one of

202
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:53,012
them is even, then that whole number [the product] is going to be even,

203
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:55,026
because [a product] that's even is a factor of that whole

204
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:56,034
string of numbers.

205
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:58,069
But anyway, you could try it with 2, 3, 4, or you could try

206
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:00,055
it with 3, 4, 5.

207
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:02,047
Either way, you're going to get an even number.

208
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,084
So this is also right.

209
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:16,915
Statement 3: (a+b+c)/3 is an integer.

210
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,967
Well, let's think about it.

211
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,052
I don't know.

212
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:25,050
Let's say if we were to take a + b + c.

213
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,094
I don't know, even if we were to take-- let's see, 3 + 4 plus---

214
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,050
No, that works.

215
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,084
2 + 3-- No, that works.

216
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:36,053
Let's write it as-- So this is a + a + 1, right?

217
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:42,070
([Because] b is a + 1.) -- plus a + 2 over 3, right?

218
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:50,073
And so this is equal to (3a+3)/3.

219
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,038
([Because] b is just a + 1; c is a + 2.)

220
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,042
You add them all together.

221
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,036
Sure enough, you could divide the top and the

222
00:10:55,036 --> 00:11:01,062
bottom by 3 and you get a + 1.

223
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:04,050
So yeah. Statement 3 is also correct.

224
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,004
This is always going to evaluate to a + 1, which is

225
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:07,088
an integer.

226
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:11,069
So all three are true. So that is choice E.

227
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:13,039
And I'm all out of time.

228
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,041
See you in the next video.
