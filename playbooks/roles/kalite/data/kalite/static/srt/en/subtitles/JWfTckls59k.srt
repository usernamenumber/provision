1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,060
Let's do a problem on
exponential growth.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,150
And if you think about it, what
we're going to do here with a

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,820
bacteria, it's no different
than what we did with compound

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:16,190
interest when we learned about
interest and the number e.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,340
Because if you think about it--
well, I'll draw the analogy

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,680
as we do this problem.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,740
Anyway, this is a compound
growth problem, or an

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,240
exponential growth problem.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,300
And it says: a bacteria culture
initially contains 100

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,010
cells and grows at a rate
proportional to its size.

12
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,770
After an hour, the population
has increased to 420.

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,070
So this first says find an
expression for the number

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,490
of bacteria after t hours.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,910
So in general, anything that--
When you're dealing with

16
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,140
exponential growth or
exponential decay.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,130
Or continuously compounding
growth or continuously

18
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,730
compounding decay, though
you'll very seldom

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,480
hear that term.

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,440
The amount of whatever you have
as a function of time will

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,690
be this type of equation.

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,780
I'll say bacteria as
a function of time.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,940
So I'll say b of t.

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,310
And I'll do it here.

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,180
So b of-- Well, let me
do it here. b of t.

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,440
Bacteria as a function of time
is going to be equal to the

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,260
initial bacteria, or the
initial of whatever we have for

28
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,080
doing compound interest is
the amount we start

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,980
with, e to the kt.

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,370
Where k is kind of our
compounding rate.

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,790
And so in general, if you
have this I naught, the

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,400
initial amount you have.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,180
And that makes sense, right?

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,960
Because if t equals 0, this
whole expression is 1.

35
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,490
So b of 0 should
just be I naught.

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,790
So if you know what you start
with, and then you have another

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,120
point, you can solve for k.

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
And then you have
an expression.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,100
You have the first
thing they want.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,060
Find an expression for the
number bacteria after t hours.

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,750
So my question to you is, first
of all, what is I sub zero?

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,030
What is your initial number
of bacterial cells?

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,260
Well they tell us.

44
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,430
They tell us right here.

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,340
The bacteria culture initially
contains 100 cells.

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,610
   

47
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:07,980
So we know that b of 0 when
time equals 0 or 0 hours, that

48
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,620
is equal to 100 where the
unit is cells, right?

49
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,320
And so, if we substitute
here t equals 0, this is 1.

50
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,280
So we know that I naught
is equal to 100.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,370
Let me do that actually.

52
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,040
So b of 0 is also equal-- if we
look at it there --I naught

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,730
times e to the what? k times 0
times e to the zero is

54
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,960
equal to I naught.

55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,740
So this tells us that the
bacteria at time 0 is 100.

56
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,010
And then when we substitute
here, is that the bacteria

57
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,140
times 0 is equal to I naught.

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,080
So I naught must equal 100.

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,410
OK.

60
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,460
So we're making some progress.

61
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:47,070
So we know that the bacteria
as a function of time is

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:54,020
equal to I naught, 100,
times e to the kt.

63
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,800
Now, if we just knew k, then we
would have done this part A,

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,020
find an expression for the
number bacteria after t hours.

65
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,860
Well how can we figure out k?

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,900
Well they give us
another data point.

67
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,810
After an hour, the population
has increased to 420.

68
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,710
So that tells us-- Let me--

69
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:26,810
[SIDE COMMENTS]

70
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,570
Anyway, so what was I doing?

71
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,800
Oh.

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,550
So this tells us, after
an hour the population

73
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,190
has increased to 420.

74
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,070
So that tells us
that b of 1, right?

75
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,710
After 1 hour, the population
has increased to 420.

76
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,090
So b of 1 is equal to 420.

77
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,990
Which is also equal to--
If we put 1 here, that is

78
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,080
equal to 100 e to the kt.

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,110
Well what's t at b of 1?

80
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,940
t is 1.

81
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,750
So e to the k, right?

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,200
So 420 is equal to
100 e to the k.

83
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,690
And now we can solve for k.

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,490
And let's see what we get.

85
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,020
So we divide both sides by 100.

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,720
You get 4.2.

87
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,360
   

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,350
Let me put e to the
k on this side.

89
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,800
e to the k is equal to 4.2.

90
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,890
   

91
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,670
To solve for k, we take the
natural log of both sides.

92
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,000
And we get k is equal to the
natural log of 4.2, which is

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,440
going to be some
bizarre number.

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,380
And we can-- We'll figure that
out later with a calculator.

95
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,050
So there we figured out-- Using
the initial condition here,

96
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,110
we figured out I naught.

97
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,240
And then using this extra
data point, we solved for k.

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,520
And we got k is equal to the
ln of the natural log of 4.2.

99
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,390
So what does that leave us?

100
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,580
So now we know the equation.

101
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,310
We know k and we know I naught,
so we know that the equation

102
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:04,360
is-- So part A, the equation is
b of t, bacteria as a function

103
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,610
of time is equal to the initial
number of bacteria, 100

104
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,060
cells, e to the kt.

105
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:17,770
And k is ln of 4.2.

106
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,766
That says 4.2.

107
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:23,040
And all of that times t.

108
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,950
So that's our function.

109
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,860
I know you can't read that,
but we'll use it again.

110
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,820
So it should make
a little sense.

111
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,640
So then they say find-- this
is part B --find the number

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,260
of bacteria after 3 hours.

113
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,500
So that's pretty
straight forward.

114
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,100
We have our function now.

115
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,620
That at any time t, we
can tell you how many

116
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,370
bacteria there are.

117
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,970
So let's figure out the number
of bacteria after 3 hours.

118
00:05:45,970 --> 00:06:04,490
So b of 3 is equal to 100 times
e to the ln of 4.2 times 3.

119
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,910
And that number we
could calculate if you

120
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,780
have a calculator.

121
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,240
e to the ln of-- Let's see.

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,570
That's essentially-- Well
what's this going to be?

123
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,380
This is the same thing.

124
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,010
We can actually figure
this out analytically.

125
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:22,970
That equals 100 e to the
natural log oh 4.2.

126
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,920
If you have two things in an
exponent multiplied, that's the

127
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,770
same thing as taking that and
then raising it to the

128
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,550
third power, right?

129
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,273
If we were simplifying, we'd
say oh that's the same thing

130
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:32,980
as just multiplying
that times this.

131
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,330
What's e to the ln of 4.2?

132
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,730
Well it's 4.2, right?

133
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,240
Because natural log says well,
what exponent do I have

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,850
to raise e to to get 4.2?

135
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,720
So if I raise e to that
exponent, I get 4.2.

136
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
So that equals-- I didn't even
have to use a calculator, look

137
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,330
at that --4.2 to
the third power.

138
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,400
And I don't know what that is.

139
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,310
That's going to be probably
70 something and so

140
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,360
we'll do that later.

141
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,170
But that's part B.

142
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,820
That's just plugging
into your calculator.

143
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,550
That's part B.

144
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,760
Now what are they asking?

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,800
Find the rate of
growth after 3 hours.

146
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,370
Let me do that in
a special color.

147
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,140
So what are they asking us for?

148
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,200
Well they're essentially asking
us what is the slope of this

149
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,730
function after 3 hours?

150
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,660
Or another way you could view
it is what is the derivative

151
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,080
at time is equal to 3?

152
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,850
Let's do that.

153
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,660
Let me erase all this
other stuff I have.

154
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,440
I think we can erase all of
this because we've written

155
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,080
down our equation here.

156
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,380
We can erase that.

157
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,970
Actually we could even erase
all of this because we've

158
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,960
just answered that.

159
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,200
That's just plugging into a
calculator at this point.

160
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Just want to keep our
original equation.

161
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,380
So let's do part C.

162
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Part C, find the rate of
growth after 3 hours.

163
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,750
So we just have to take the
derivative of the bacteria

164
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,230
function with respect to time.

165
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,060
So let's do that.

166
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,700
So b prime of t.

167
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,090
It equals what?

168
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,160
So what's the derivative of--
Let's just do the chain rule.

169
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,450
What's the derivative of-- so
we can have 100 constant out

170
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,720
there times the derivative
of this inside function.

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,446
Well, that's just a
constant times t, so

172
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,450
it's just a constant.

173
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:29,053
So times ln of 4.2 times
the derivative of e

174
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:29,860
to the whole thing.

175
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,280
Well, the derivative of e
to the x is e to the x.

176
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,620
So the chain rule tells us
it's just the derivative

177
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,860
of this whole expression.

178
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,570
So times e to the ln 4.2t.

179
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,940
   

180
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,500
So that's the derivative
at any time t.

181
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,390
And then they want to know
what the rate of growth

182
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,460
is after 3 hours.

183
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:06,140
So b prime of 3 is equal
to 100 ln of 4.2.

184
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,500
All of that times-- Well,
e to the-- As we just

185
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,360
did this in part B.

186
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,720
e to the ln 4.2 times 3, that's
the same thing as-- Because

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,110
this expression right
here is just 4.2.

188
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,310
This is times 4.2 to the third.

189
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,540
That's just a little bit of
logarithm math we did here.

190
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,860
And it's the same exact logic.

191
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,110
All I did is I substituted
3 here and simplified.

192
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,210
Hopefully that makes
sense to you.

193
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,140
If it doesn't, you might want
to use your calculator.

194
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,300
But this all is actually a
pretty important thing to know.

195
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,690
That e to the ln of x is
just equal to x, right?

196
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,510
Because ln of x is essentially
saying what exponent do I

197
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,950
have to raise e to to get x?

198
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,550
So if I raise e to that
exponent, I get x.

199
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,710
So that's all I'm saying here.

200
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:02,130
That this right here is the
same thing as e to the

201
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,440
ln 4.2 to the t, right?

202
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,040
Because if you were to
simplify, you just take

203
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,430
this exponent and multiply
this and you'd get this.

204
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,830
And so this is just
4.2 to the t, right?

205
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,550
Actually that's-- I should
have written our original

206
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,550
equation as that.

207
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,630
I could rewrite our original
bacterial function equation as

208
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:34,530
100 times-- using that same
thing --times 4.2

209
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,370
to the t power.

210
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,320
Actually, that is a simpler
bacterial equation

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,970
than this one.

212
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,150
And so that would be even a
better answer for part A.

213
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,440
And then that makes part
B even easier to solve.

214
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,300
And then part C.

215
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,020
Well part C is actually-- it
was easier to keep it in this

216
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,500
form because taking a
derivative of e is easier than

217
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,010
taking a derivative
of another base.

218
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,620
And actually we would probably
want to convert backwards.

219
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,340
So it's good we left it in that
form because it made the

220
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,120
derivative all that easier.

221
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,730
But we could rewrite the
derivative as well.

222
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,580
We could rewrite this
as b prime of t is

223
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:17,010
equal to 100 ln 4.2.

224
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,850
All of that times 4.2
to the t, right?

225
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,300
I just took a this-- Sorry.

226
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,430
No.

227
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,240
I took this and I
replaced it with this.

228
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,400
Anyway, I got a little bit
messier than I wanted to.

229
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,500
But then their final
question is when will the

230
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,366
population reach 10,000?

231
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:42,140
So let me see erase what
we did with part C.

232
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,360
   

233
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:54,670
When will the population
reach 10,000?

234
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,180
Let me write what we
have already done a

235
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,570
little bit neater.

236
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,790
We know-- We knew that, part A,
b of t is equal to 100 e to

237
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,110
the natural log of 4.2t.

238
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,860
   

239
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,590
And I said that's the
same thing as 100 times

240
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,716
4.2 to the t power.

241
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:20,370
And they say when will the
population reach 10,000?

242
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,920
So they're essentially saying
when is-- at what time t

243
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,490
is b of t equal to 10,000?

244
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:37,140
So we can just say 10,000 is
equal to this: 100-- And

245
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,330
actually, I'm going to use this
one because I want to take the

246
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,950
natural log of both sides.

247
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,520
And it just makes
things simpler.

248
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:49,020
100e to the ln 4.2t.

249
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,740
   

250
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,770
So you could divide
both sides by 100.

251
00:12:53,770 --> 00:13:05,570
And you get 100 is equal
to e to the ln 4.2t.

252
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,280
   

253
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,360
And now take the natural
logs of both sides of

254
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,460
this equation, right?

255
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,390
So then we get what?

256
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,715
We get-- let me draw a
divide-- Well, I'll do

257
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,320
it in a different color.

258
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,850
We get-- taking the natural log
of both sides of this --the

259
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:27,060
natural log of 100 is equal
to-- Well if you take the

260
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,680
natural log of e to
something, you're just left

261
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,330
with the something.

262
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,920
And you might want to review
all the logarithms if you found

263
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,720
that a little confusing.

264
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,660
But that-- If you take
the natural log of this

265
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,710
side, you're just left
with the exponent.

266
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,665
So that equals ln of 4.2t.

267
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:47,090
And if you want to solve for
t, you just divide both

268
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,940
sides by ln of 4.2.

269
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,700
And you get t is equal
to ln of 100 divided by

270
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,280
the natural log of 4.2.

271
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,290
And that'll be an hour.

272
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,260
So how many hours does it take?

273
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,030
You just plug this in your
calculator and you will get a

274
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,890
number for the number of hours.

275
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,580
Hopefully you didn't find
that too confusing.

276
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,460
And actually since-- Just to
hit another point home, we

277
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,760
could have used this equation.

278
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,340
And it's the same thing, right?

279
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,170
And what would we
would have had?

280
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:19,400
We would have had 100 times 4.2
to t power is equal to 10,000.

281
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,980
Divide both sides by 100
and you get 4.2 to the

282
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,310
t is equal to 100.

283
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,950
And so, to solve this-- So
you're essentially saying log

284
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,650
base-- You would essentially
want to take log base 4.2

285
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,630
of both sides of this.

286
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:42,520
So you would say t is equal
to log base 4.2 of 100.

287
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,370
And I went over this in the
exponent proper-- in the

288
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,600
logarithm properties video.

289
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,360
But it's a pretty useful
thing to know in general.

290
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,060
How do you figure out-- Your
calculator has two bases.

291
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,050
It has log base 10 and it
has log base e, which

292
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,140
is the natural log.

293
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,210
How do you figure out log base
of another number of 100?

294
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,200
Well, the simple answer is you
could take natural log of this

295
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,700
and divide it by the
natural log of this.

296
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,080
You could also take log base
ten of this and divide it by

297
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,960
log ten base of this--
log base ten of this.

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,490
Anyway, hopefully I didn't
further confuse you.

299
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,880
And I will do-- This was
actually exponential growth.

300
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,730
And you could replace
these words.

301
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,460
You could say-- Instead of
saying bacteria culture, you

302
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,680
could say a bank account
initially contains $100 and

303
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,400
grows at a rate proportional
to its size, which would

304
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,610
mean compound interest.

305
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,920
And then you could say, after
an hour the population has

306
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,480
increased to, whatever, $4.20.

307
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,500
And then find the expression
for the number of-- So

308
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,290
essentially, you'd be trying
to figure out the compound

309
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,290
interest rate and all of that.

310
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,160
But this is the exact
same phenomenon.

311
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,020
That the larger you grow,
you're going to grow by an

312
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,420
absolute value more than that.

313
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,102
Anyway, I'll do more of these
problems because they can

314
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:53,870
be a little confusing.

315
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,950
And I'll do one on
exponential decay as well.

316
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,660
See you soon.

317
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,400
