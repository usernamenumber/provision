1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:07,066
So I have a slip of paper. Let's go through these lab values.

2
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:12,996
I actually put down a number of values that we're going to pretend for a moment are my labs.

3
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:15,609
And you can see the range and the units next to them.

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:19,354
So let's go through it piece by piece, and actually while I do it I'm actually going to

5
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:27,582
show you some short hand techniques so you can understand, if you ever see this in the future, what it refers to.

6
00:00:27,582 --> 00:00:31,863
So some short hand that people have come up with, this isn't necessarily something I've come up with.

7
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:38,108
I learned it from folks ahead of me, but it's been used, not just in the U.S., but most parts of the world.

8
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,839
It's pretty uniform.

9
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:45,113
So if you're looking at these labs, here's a quick way to transcribe them. So imagine you

10
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:50,480
have to quickly put it on a piece of paper and move on. This is how you would do it.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,162
So you draw a little stick diagram like that and in the far left you'd put the number "5."

12
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:59,635
And this refers to the first row, the white blood cell row. And we know the value is 5000 so

13
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:05,417
that's what the 5 represents. And it's understood that that number is in thousands of cells per milliliter.

14
00:01:05,417 --> 00:01:10,085
So if you see a 5, you know we're talking about thousands of cells per milliliter.

15
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:15,498
And the next question is well, what are those types of cells if you were to actually look at them? We know they're

16
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:21,230
white blood cells, but exactly what type they are is actually in the six rows beneath.

17
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,899
So these six rows tell you the breakdown of this number.

18
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,944
So that's why they're percents. And so the 5000 cells break down into:

19
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:35,445
Segmented neutrophils (I'm gonna write that as an S with a 61).

20
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,565
And Bands, there are 3% bands.

21
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:48,585
Lymphocytes are 29%, and then we have monocytes at 4%, basophils at 1%, and Eosinophils at 2%.

22
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:53,912
So these percentages for the different types of white blood cells are going to add up to 100. Right?

23
00:01:53,912 --> 00:02:00,930
So let's just double check. We've got 7 and 29 is 36 and 3 is 39. Yep 100%.

24
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,419
So that's how you quickly can see the different types of white blood cells floating around in your body.

25
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:08,004
That's what those numbers represent.

26
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:13,416
So then the next two numbers: hemoglobin and hematocrit go in the top and bottom of this stick diagram.

27
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:20,919
And again when you see these numbers like this I could look at that and immediately figure out that's the red blood cell content.

28
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:24,161
Those two numbers both reflect red blood cell content in the blood.

29
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:28,626
And then the last cell, on this side, represents the platelet count.

30
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:40,103
And 227 represents 227 thousand cells per microliter. So before we were talking about milliliters (for the white blood cells)

31
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:46,154
but now for the platelets we're talking about microliters. And in fact I'll put cells in quotes because we know it's

32
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:49,184
not really cells, it's these are little cell fragments that are the platelets.

33
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:56,248
So that 227,000 tells you about how many platelet cell fragments are floating around in one microliter of blood.

34
00:02:56,248 --> 00:03:01,909
So that's the first chunk of data. So that's all of this information kind of summarized

35
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,968
very quickly in that stick diagram.

36
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,684
Now let's move on to the chemistries.

37
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:13,655
So if someone orders a chem 7, then that'd be the first seven of these. And if they order a chem 10

38
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:17,766
then that would be all ten of these.

39
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:22,582
So this is how you would kind of draw this out as a stick diagram. It kind of goes like this.

40
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:27,432
And the chem 10, the last three go in here.

41
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:32,749
So the Sodium goes in the top left, and below that is the 4.3 for Postassium.

42
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:40,717
And you're just going systematically all the way through it. So for Chloride it's 103, and bicarbonate goes, it's 22, right below that,

43
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:48,654
and the Creatinine goes in this cell, 0.8, and the blood urea nitrogen, sometimes they call that the BUN,

44
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:55,720
that's just the first letter of these three- is 15. And then the fasting glucose is 92.

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,622
And then the Calcium goes in the top of this little wishbone shaped stick diagram. That goes right there.

46
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:10,617
The Magnesium goes on this side, and the Phosphate goes on this side. So that's the Chem 7 on top,

47
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,412
and the Chem 10 would be all of that kind of together.

48
00:04:14,412 --> 00:04:25,657
And then the bottom we have some liver enzymes, and also there's a stick diagram for that as well, kind of a fast way to draw it.

49
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:34,022
And it is basically just an X. So the top of the X is two numbers, so you usually write the total bilirubin like this

50
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:39,610
1.1 and then you put a slash and you put the other number there, the direct bilirubin, 0.1.

51
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:46,522
And then on the left you put the AST and on the right you put the ALT, and at the bottom you

52
00:04:46,522 --> 00:04:53,764
put the Alkaline phosphatase, 76. This is how the numbers kind of break down, so again if you ever see any of these stick

53
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:59,192
diagrams and you're wondering what they refer to. Now you kind of have broken the code, you know what number goes where.

54
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:05,205
So if you see, for example, this number, the 22, you immediately know that they're talking about the ALT.

55
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:12,906
So this is the way that people quickly diagram things. And now I know when people look at labs, the first thing they

56
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:19,808
want to know is-hey is this good or bad? So they want to look at these values and they want to compare them to the ranges.

57
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:23,190
They want to say- hey does this fit into the normal range that people expect?

58
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:32,589
So let's talk about that. Let's talk about normal range, and what normal means exactly because I know that's the first thing

59
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:41,383
most people will want to look at. So let me draw out what a normal curve would look like. So if you actually took

60
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:48,383
everybody, let's say 10,000- but it's not everybody, but it's a big chunk of people- 10,000 people and asked them

61
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:53,826
all to tell you their white blood cell count they will give you, of course, many different numbers.

62
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:57,698
They're probably wondering what you're doing with that information. But let's say they give you their answer.

63
00:05:57,698 --> 00:06:07,527
And say you plot it all on a curve and you draw a little diagram. This would be basically what you would find.

64
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:19,081
You'd say- okay most people have a white blood cell- and this is white blood cell count down here- and this is of course in thousands, we said.

65
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:29,483
Thousands of cells per mililiter. And this is frequency, this is the number of people. I'll just write "f" for frequency.

66
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:39,680
So you'd say- okay while there are a lot of people kind of in this range right here, and in fact 95% of people fall into this middle section

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,517
In this area, so this is definitely the bulk of people that fit between 4.5 and 10.

68
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:53,994
And that's actually how most of these ranges are decided upon. They say okay where do the bulk of folks lie.

69
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:59,875
And it's usually between those numbers that are in the range and that also means, if you think about it,

70
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:07,179
that there's of course somebody out here, and somebody up here. I mean that is by definition going to happen.

71
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:15,092
You are going to have 5% of people in one of those two tails combined. So whenever you see a range, just keep in mind, there is some

72
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:22,375
normal variance, they're called, that kind of go above or below that range. But that range usually captures the majority of folks.

73
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:27,296
So when thinking about that, when thinking about what exactly goes into a normal range. Consider some of

74
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:37,260
the things that could make what is "normal" different. So for example let's say I may check someone's hematocrit.

75
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:44,114
Let's say I'm looking at the hematocrit and I want to find out if it's normal or not. If I look at a baby's hematocrit but I use an adult's range

76
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:49,964
then it would be very very unusually high. So a newborn baby has a very high hematocrit.

77
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:53,026
So I really should be comparing it to other newborn babies.

78
00:07:53,026 --> 00:08:01,954
So age is really important to consider. So you want to make sure that the range of values is age appropriate.

79
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:08,179
You also want to make sure that gender is considered. So for example the normal range for men's hematocrit

80
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:16,733
is a little bit higher than the normal range for women's hematocrit. So range matters for age and also for gender.

81
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:23,666
Now different labs will also differ. So it's actually quite interesting, you can even go online and see what the normal ranges

82
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:28,718
for a lot of these things that I have here, and the numbers will be a little different from what I have shown you.

83
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:37,787
So if you go from one lab to another, you'll get different numbers. And in fact lab technique also matters. So even within

84
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:45,472
a lab, depending on the technique they use to get an answer to something, the range could differ. And that actually matters

85
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:54,329
particularly for things like this. So these IUs that I put down here, they stand for International Units.

86
00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:04,767
And that's specific to a type of lab assay that's done and again that depends on the exact assay that's done and that's

87
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,357
going to change the range of values that you get there. So consider the technique.

88
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:14,561
And finally consider the situation. So if you have, let's say a person who is

89
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:21,040
supposed to come in for a fasting glucose and usually you're told, you know don't eat anything overnight and

90
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,185
don't have breakfast and come in and get your blood taken first thing in the morning. It's a pretty common scenario.

91
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:32,445
Then you would have a normal fasting glucose, and it should be below 100. But let's say by accident you

92
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:38,303
decide to have a little snack in the morning because that's your usual thing, you have some toast.

93
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:47,975
Umm, your blood glucose could go up as a result. So that glucose result could be okay if someone knows that you didn't fast really,

94
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:54,124
you had a little snack. So that situation changed, so you're metabolism is going to make that range go up.

95
00:09:54,124 --> 00:10:00,052
So only for fasting glucose is the number below 100 normal. Otherwise it could be higher.

96
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:05,701
Now consider a situation where you're taking a medication. Let's say you're on a medication that makes your potassium go down.

97
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:12,958
So you're on a drug that causes potassium to leave your kidneys and go into your urine. Your potassium value would

98
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,211
then go down. I would expect it to be lower right? Because you're taking your medication. So some of these ranges

99
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:25,522
are going to change depending on what medications you take, what you had for breakfast that day, or not had for breakfast,

100
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:29,679
what kind of medical conditions you have. So it's going to definitely depend on the situation.

101
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:36,188
So whenever you look at ranges and values and you want to see if you're in the normal range, just consider all of these things

102
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:40,188
that could explain why your number may or may not be within that range.
