00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:06,009
The equation of a circle c is x plus three squared plus y minus four squared equals forty-nine.

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,209
What are its center (h,k) and its radius r?

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,015
So let's just remind ourselves of what a circle is.

4
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:15,870
You have some point, let's call that (h,k).

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,737
A circle is a set of all points that are equal distance from that point.

6
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:26,427
So let's take a set of all points that are say r away from that point.

7
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:30,470
So let's say that this distance right over here,

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,347
is r, so we want all the set of points that are exactly r away from

9
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:39,873
so all the points (x, y) that are r away.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,937
So you can imagine you can rotate around and all of these points are going to be r away.

11
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:50,604
I'm going to try my best to draw at least a somewhat perfect-looking circle,

12
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:52,211
I won't be able to do a perfect job on it,

13
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:53,538
but you get a sense.

14
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:59,332
All of these are exactly r away, at least if I were to draw it properly,

15
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,935
they are r away.

16
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,930
So how do we find an equation in terms of r and (h,k)

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,336
and x and y that describes all these points?

18
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:12,675
Well we know how to find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane

19
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:15,665
and in fact, it comes straight out of the pythagorean theorem.

20
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,808
If we were to draw a vertical line right over here that essentially

21
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:22,545
is the change in the vertical axis between these two points,

22
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:28,075
up here, we're at y, here, we're at k,

23
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:31,735
so this distance is going to be y minus k.

24
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:39,066
We can do the exact same thing on the horizontal line,

25
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:43,808
This x coordinate is x while this x coordinate is h,

26
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:49,677
so this is going to be x minus h, is this distance

27
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:55,538
So this is a right triangle because we're measuring vertical distance here,

28
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:59,344
We're measuring horizontal distance here, so these two things are perpendicular.

29
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:06,431
So from the Pythagorean theorem, we know that this squared plus this squared must be equal to

30
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,203
r distance squared, so this is where the distance formula comes from.

31
00:02:09,203 --> 00:02:18,349
So we know that x minus h squared plus y minus k squared

32
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:22,097
must be equal to r squared.

33
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:29,799
Any x and y that satisfies this equation will sit on this circle.

34
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,759
Now with that out of the way, let's go answer the question.

35
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,268
The equation of the circle is this thing.

36
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:37,209
And this looks awfully close to what we just wrote,

37
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,936
we just have to make sure we don't get confused with the negative.

38
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:43,008
remember, it has to be the form x minus h and y minus k.

39
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,534
So let's write a little bit differently.

40
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:49,537
Instead of x plus 3 squared, we can write that as x minus negative three squared,

41
00:02:49,537 --> 00:03:00,943
and then plus y minus 4 squared is equal to

42
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:05,136
instead of 49, we can just call that seven squared.

43
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:08,869
So now it becomes pretty clear,

44
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:23,426
that our h is -3, and our k is positive 4,

45
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:26,542
and that our r is 7.

46
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:35,345
So we can say (h,k) is (-3,4).

47
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,538
You might say hey, there's a negative four here

48
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:39,015
but no, look it's minus k, so k is 4.

49
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:41,603
Likewise, it's minus h, you might say, hey, maybe h is a

50
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:44,469
positive three, but no, you're subtracting the h,

51
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,877
so you'd say minus negative three.

52
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:50,639
And similarly, the radius is 7.
