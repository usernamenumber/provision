1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,342
Write 7/8 ths as a decimal.

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:08,045
The main realisation here is 7 / 8

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:17,111
is the same thing as 7 รท 8.

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:21,516
These are all the same way or different ways of writing the same thing.

5
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:26,540
So lets actually divide 8 into 7. I will do it down here.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,334
I am going to divide 8 into 7. And I am going

7
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:34,112
to add a decimal point here just because we know that this value is going to be less than one.

8
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:35,683
7 / 8 is less than 1.

9
00:00:35,714 --> 00:00:41,608
We are going to have some digits beyond or to the right of the decimal point.

10
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,556
And let me put the decimal point right up here, right above the decimal point in 7.

11
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:46,820
And then we start dividing.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,382
And now this really turns into a long division problem

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,162
and we just have to make sure that we keep track of the decimal sign.

14
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:58,866
So 8 does not go into 7 at all, but it does go into 70.

15
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:07,539
So 8 goes into 70 8 times.

16
00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:14,550
8X8 =64. And then you subtract. 70 - 64 = 6

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,854
And then bring down another zero because we still have a remainder.

18
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,816
We want to get to a point that we have no remainders,

19
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:24,166
assuming that this thing doesn't repeat forever and then there's other ways we can deal with that.

20
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:33,916
8 goes into 60 7 times

21
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:40,008
7 X 8 = 56. And then we subtract again.

22
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:46,104
60-56 = 4, now we can bring down another zero right over here.

23
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:52,454
8 goes into 40 exactly 5 times. 5 X 8 = 40

24
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:56,546
We have nothing left over.

25
00:01:56,546 --> 00:02:04,336
And so we are done. 7 รท 8 or 7/8 = .875

26
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:09,661
But I'll put a leading zero here just so it makes it clear that this is where the decimal is.

27
00:02:09,661 --> 99:59:59,999
0.875. And we are done.
