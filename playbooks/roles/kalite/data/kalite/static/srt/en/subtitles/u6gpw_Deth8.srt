1
00:00:01,832 --> 00:00:05,904
So for last 20, 30 years we've noticed an increased in autism.

2
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:09,380
I'm actually gonna quickly scatch out a graph to show you what I mean.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,998
We have autism rates over here and if you fall them over time basically what

4
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:18,742
happens that you see that things are going upwards. And the main reason that people say is awarness.

5
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:22,229
They say we have more parents in families are aware of autism

6
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:24,084
because we talk about it more nowdays.

7
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:28,000
Then of course we're gonna bring it up with the doctors and it's gonna get diagnosed. And although that

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,245
may be one reason for the increase, people have been searching for other reasons to explain

9
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:39,164
the increase as well. In 1998 there was a team of doctors and researchers that put together a study,

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,135
a study that we call the Wakefield study.

11
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:47,251
It's named after the main author which was a guy named doctor Wakefield.

12
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,665
He was a surgeon working in England.

13
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:53,040
And in total there were 13 people, 13 authors on this study.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,544
So this study was done in United Kingdom and what they did

15
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:01,330
was they took 12 children and these children came into the hospital

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,828
reportedly kind of a normal way, the routine way that

17
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:08,814
children come into the hospital. They were recruited and he found that they

18
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:13,837
had developmental problems. So these were 12 children with some sort of developmental

19
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:20,252
problem or delay and the most common example of a developmental problem

20
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:25,065
among these kids was autism. So lot of these kids under the paving of diagnosis of autism.

21
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,939
And what they did, I'm actually gonna scatch off for you.

22
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:33,085
Let's imagine that this is the head of one of our children.

23
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,756
What he asked them was you know do they have any symptoms,

24
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:39,317
when did the symptoms start, all these kinds of things to kind of get it

25
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:44,471
their history, their medical history. And lot of the families said you know we remember them

26
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:50,663
having these symptoms of autism which I'm drawing as kind of a greyed out brain

27
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:53,879
and there seems to be, this is their parents talking

28
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,273
they felt like there's some sort of relationship with the vaccine.

29
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:03,256
They felt like they remembered the vaccine specificaly the MMR vaccine - measles, mumps,

30
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,366
rubella vaccine around the time that symptoms began

31
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:14,399
and that's what he reported. So we actually have now a relationship based in turns of parents recolection

32
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:20,584
between the vaccine and autism. But what the study was mainly about was actually the gut.

33
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:25,170
So he was a surgeon and he wanted to look at the intestins of these kids.

34
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,998
And he noticed that on the intestinal biopsies, when you actually got a little bit of

35
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:34,742
tissue from these intestins, a lot of them had inflamation. That was what his

36
00:02:34,742 --> 00:02:38,421
paper was primarily about was this inflamation result.

37
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:43,540
So he proposed and this is a big deal, he proposed that vaccine was causing this

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,317
inflamation. He thought that was the cause of the inflamation and he then thought

39
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:53,253
that perhaps there's some mystery protein, let's say this blue little protein, that

40
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:59,168
maybe you take in through a diet, that can now because it's inflamed can get accros the gut

41
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:05,135
and kind of affect the developing brain. So this was how he proposed there could be a link

42
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:10,542
between the vaccine and autism. Now when the Wakefield study first came out in 1998 you can

43
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,966
imagine the kind of excitement this created for lot of parents and families

44
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:18,874
that have been for years looking for something to explain, why their kid had autism.

45
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:24,419
And so finally people could kind of circle this and say ah! maybe was the vaccine that cause

46
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,174
autism, that's what people thought. But there where couple of problems with this idea.

47
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:34,197
The first problem was that some of the patients that had autism symptoms, they

48
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:39,587
actually reported that they were having these symptoms before they had any of the

49
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:44,751
gut symptoms. Now think about that, if you're having autism symptoms before

50
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:49,815
gut symptoms not after, then that really goes against this theory because this theory

51
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:55,373
is based on the idea that it's the gut that comes first, so immediately this is one

52
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:59,568
concern kind of a big question mark over here whether this is really true.

53
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:04,132
Another question mark is around this mystery protein up here. So this mystery

54
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:08,838
protein, this is something that Wakefield never realy identified, he never said

55
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:15,078
well I think it's this protein or that one, and in the last 15 plus years nobody

56
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:19,520
has founded this mystery protein, that would explain what Wakefield was suggesting.

57
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,339
So the fact, that nobody can actually find these proteins is also another big question mark.

58
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,268
Neverthles a lot of studies started getting done. You know people started saying

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:35,229
there truly is relationship between vaccines and autism. Then let's explore that further.

60
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:41,420
So a group of studies were done around MMR vaccine rates. How often

61
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,936
in a population do you actually see people getting them MMR vaccine. And you'd imagined

62
00:04:45,936 --> 00:04:49,696
that if there truly is a link between vaccine causing autism, if that's true

63
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:53,671
then of course the vaccine rates must be going up, you know that would explain the

64
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:57,220
autism going up. And so they actually looked in few different places and of course

65
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,671
the first place to talk about is the UK, because of course the study was initially

66
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:06,029
done in the UK. And in the UK they looked over 6 years and they found that actually

67
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:12,132
MMR vaccine rates had been steady. There had not been in an increase. So already this is

68
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:15,771
a little wierd if you're thinking that the vaccine is causing autism, you'd expect

69
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:20,424
something different. So they looked again, actually looked another time. This time they

70
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:27,729
actually looked in the US and in US they did the study over 15 years. And over 15 years same thing

71
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,406
steady vaccine rates even though autism rates were going up. Now another study was

72
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:39,372
actually done, this time in Canada. And surprisingly, in Canada turns out that the vaccine

73
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:46,673
rates were actually going down slightly. So vaccine rates over 12 years now went down even though autism rates

74
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:52,197
were going up. So this data is done at the population level, but it really does go against

75
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:57,596
this idea that vaccine is causing autism. But people weren't satisfy with that. They wanted more

76
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:03,643
specific research to be done on this mechanism that doctor Wakefield proposed.

77
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:09,196
So another study was done and actually it was done in United Kingdom. And this study

78
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:17,633
looked at 473 autistic children. So remember the initial study was done on 12 children and now

79
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:24,196
we're looking at hundreds of children with autism. And among these 473 they actually wanted to

80
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:28,975
figure out this part of the study, is there a link between vaccine and any sort of

81
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:33,141
gut inflamation. And the answer was the resounding no there doesn't seem to be

82
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:39,266
any relationship in autistic kids with vaccine MMR vaccine and inflamation of the gut.

83
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:44,436
So that was actually very dodgemental to Wakefields theory. But what about this

84
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:51,349
second part, this second link between gut inflamation and any sort of autism. This part right here.

85
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:58,596
Well, again another study in the UK looking this time at 262 autistic children found

86
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:07,530
that there is no link between these two things. So gut inflamation and autism did not seem to be related at all.

87
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:13,933
So now the two important components of Wakefield's idea didn't seem to bear out.

88
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,677
And then I should also just kind of cross this off this mystery protien bit because

89
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:21,426
again people have been looking for that and no one seem to find that. But that wasn't

90
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:25,009
good enoug because you get say well maybe there's still some link between vaccine and autism,

91
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,873
but maybe this mechanism wasn't quite right. So research got done on this purple area over here.

92
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:34,845
So they say: Ok, what about this. You know could it be possible there is a link between

93
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:40,022
the two using some other mechanism. So study was done in the UK specifically looking at

94
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:45,094
MMR vaccine and autism, is there a relationship and it turns out that they

95
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:51,267
in this study looked at 71 autistic children and they found that among these children

96
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:56,183
there was no relationship. And this study was actually you know way done again in fact

97
00:07:56,183 --> 00:08:00,873
in another setting, done in a different way but also tried to answer the same question of

98
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:06,686
a link between vaccine and autism in Finland this time. They found that among

99
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:13,134
309 autistic children there was no link. Now remember this link that we created was

100
00:08:13,134 --> 00:08:18,731
done among 12 children and now we have hundreds and hundreds of kids in different

101
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:23,908
countries and another one was done in the US and all these states were kind of finding

102
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:30,220
the same result that basically there were no links that they could find between vaccine and

103
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,273
autism. And so people started really doubting the truth behind the very first study,

104
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:40,244
that first study done on 12 kids. But people were still talking about it and said you

105
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:44,342
know what about that Wakefield study. Isn't it possible that there could still be a link

106
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:51,798
in spite of all this other evidence. So finaly a group out of Finland tried to do another

107
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:56,766
type of study with definite approach, but they found kind of conclusively answer the question. They basically

108
00:08:56,766 --> 00:09:04,019
said well fine, why don't we follow 1.8 million children, so this is many many children

109
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,180
that were getting vaccinated and just follow them over time and see if they develop

110
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,103
autism. And this might kind of answer once and for all whether there is a link.

111
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:21,355
And so they followed these kids over time and they found a grand total of zero cases of vaccine

112
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:30,077
associated autism. So in all these cases of vaccination none of them resulted in autism.

113
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:35,607
So this point people really stop beliveing this study the Wakefield study and whether

114
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:39,351
there was any link that was kind of resolve all these studies kind of said no

115
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:43,603
there was really no link between vaccine and autism. But a question remained around the

116
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:46,772
Wakefield study and how those results were found in the first place.
