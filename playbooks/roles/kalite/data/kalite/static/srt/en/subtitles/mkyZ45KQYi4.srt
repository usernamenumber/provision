1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now I'll start to do some interesting problems

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and one of these thing

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that you'll find in probablity is that

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can always do a way more interesting problem

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so now I'm going to think about:

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm going to take a fair coin

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm going to

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
flip it 3 times

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I want to find the probability of

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
atleast one head.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
At leats one head out of the 3 flips.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the easiest way

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to think about this is

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how many equaly likely possibilities there are.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in the last video, we saw

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that If we flip a coin 3 times, there's 8 possibilities.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For the first flip,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there's 2 possibilities.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Second flip, there's 2 more possibilities.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And in the 3rd flip, there are 2 possibilities.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 2x2x2 -

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there are 8 equally likely possibilites.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I'm flipping a coin 3 times.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, how many of those possibilities

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have atleast one head?

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well we drew all of the possibilities over here

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we just have to count-

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How many of these have atleast one head?

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So thats one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So seven of these have atleast one head in them.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this last one does not.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So seven of the eight have atleast one head.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now your probably thinking-

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay Sal, we're able to do it

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by writing out all of the possibilites.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But it would be really hard If I said

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Atleat one head out of you know, 20 flips.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this time we had 12 because I had only 3 flips.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me make it clear-

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this isn't 3 flips. In 3 flips.

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This would have been a lot harder to do...

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And a lot more time consuming to do,

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if I had 20 flips.

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is there some short-cut here?

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Is there some other way to think about it?

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you couldn't, just do it in some simple way.

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can't just say: Oh! Probability of heads x probability of heads.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because if you got heads the first time

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now you dont have to get heads anymore.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or you could get heads again,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but you don't have to.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it becomes a little bit more complicated.

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But there is an easy way to think about it.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Where you could use this methodology

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right over here:

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your going to acually see this on a lot of exams

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where they actually make it seem

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like a harder problem,

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but if you just think about it in the right way,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it all of a sudden, becomes simpler!

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
One way to think abou it is-

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the probability of atleast 1 head in 3 flips

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the same thing as

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the probability of not getting all tails.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right?

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we got all tails,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
then we dont have atleast 1 head.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these 2 things are equivalent.

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of getting atleast one head

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in 3 flips, is the same thing as

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the probability of not getting all tails, in 3 flips.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So whats the probability of not getting all tails?

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, thats going to be

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(1- the probability of getting all tails).

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And since its 3 flips, its the probability of tails,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tails, and tails.

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because, any of the other situations

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are going to have atleast 1 head in them.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And thats all of the other possibilities.

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the only other left-over possibility.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you add them together,

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your going to get 1.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me write it this way.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability.. (let me wrie it in a new color, just so you see where its coming from).

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of not getting all tails

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
+ the probability of all tails.

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, this is essentially exhausted. This is all the possible circumstances.

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So your chances of getting either 'not all tails' or 'all tails',

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is mutual exclusives. So we can add them.

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the probability of (let me write it this way)...

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of 'not alll tails' or

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(just to be clear of what we are doing,

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
..or the 'probability of all tails' is going to be equal to 1.
