1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:03,636
Let's review a little bit of what Napoleon was up to

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,515
going into the war of the Third Coalition,

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,436
which really does establish Napoleon

4
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:13,189
as the dominant figure in Europe.

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:19,453
So in 1799, he takes power.

6
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,183
First with two other consuls,

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,900
but then he declares himself First Consul.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,572
So he takes power.

9
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:29,702
He becomes First-- let me put that in capital letters--

10
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:35,270
First Consul.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,572
Then in 1802, actually before I get to 1802.

12
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,673
Let me say what he did in 1800.

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,705
In 1800, remember when he took power,

14
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:44,521
we were still in the war of the Second Coalition.

15
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:47,364
We talked about that a little bit. Napoleon..or

16
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:50,390
France had lost ground, they had lost a lot of

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,357
what they had gained in the First Coalition in Italy.

18
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:55,633
The Austrians had taken it back.

19
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:59,568
So Napoleon decides to take charge, cross the Alps.

20
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:00,938
This is a picture of him.

21
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:04,449
This is Napoleon crossing the Alps.

22
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,605
Napoleon crossing the Alps

23
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,503
Leading the troops into the Alps to take back

24
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:16,723
what he felt needed to be taken back from Austria.

25
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,643
And then we learned in the last video that

26
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:22,109
that essentially is what ended the First Coalition.

27
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:31,747
So in 1800 he takes back or leaves to take back Italy.

28
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:39,859
Leaves to take back Italy.

29
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,373
And when we talk about Italy,

30
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:43,122
we're really talking about the Kingdom of Italy,

31
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:44,498
which was northern Italy.

32
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,287
We're not talking about the Kingdom of Naples,

33
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:49,286
which was southern Italy. Or the Papal States.

34
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:51,986
Actually let me show you that.

35
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,767
If we go all the way down here.

36
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,967
You'll see when people talk about the Kingdom of Italy

37
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,892
in this period of time, they're really talking about

38
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:01,300
this region up here, which is really northern Italy.

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,032
The Papal States are right here.

40
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,044
And you had your Kingdom of Naples down there.

41
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:08,713
Compared to modern Europe, the two countries that

42
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:10,315
we associate with Europe today that

43
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:14,128
really didn't exist in a unified form in the early 1800s

44
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,979
were Italy and Germany.

45
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,300
They were really just broken up

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,305
into a bunch of kingdoms.

47
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,120
And as I mentioned before, Germany at this point,

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,373
that confederation of kingdoms

49
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,456
was kind of referred to as the Holy Roman Empire

50
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,234
where the King of Austria was referreed..had the title of

51
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:31,772
Holy Roman Emperor.

52
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:33,753
But he didn't necessarily...con..

53
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:37,885
he didn't control the Holy Roman Empire

54
00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:40,758
in a very centralized fashion.

55
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:45,090
It was actually controlled by a bunch of smaller kings.

56
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,084
But anyway, let's go back to Napoleon.

57
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,623
So that's him crossing the Alps in 1800.

58
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,117
That ends when he takes it back.

59
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:55,360
He defeats Austria.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
That is essentially the end of the Second Coalition.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,688
We learned that in the last video.

62
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,604
1801 - You had your Treaty of Luneville.

63
00:03:03,604 --> 00:03:09,777
End of Second Coalition.

64
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,606
They don't have a treaty with Great Britain

65
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,602
until the next year, really just out of attrition.

66
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:16,224
But that doesn't matter, it was a very short-lived treaty.

67
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:20,229
And then in 1802,

68
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:24,332
before we start talking about the Third Coalition,

69
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:36,502
Napoleon gets the Constitution of the Year X passed.

70
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:37,937
And why do you say year 10? Remember,

71
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:40,614
they had this whole revolutionary calendar going.

72
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,742
So this was.. in the revolutionary calendar

73
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:45,876
this was the 10th year of the Revolution.

74
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:50,145
But what's really relevant from Napoleon's point of view

75
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,621
is article one. It says,

76
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:55,475
the French people name and the senate proclaims

77
00:03:55,475 --> 00:04:00,218
Napoleon Bonaparte First Consul for Life.

78
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:06,149
First Consul for Life.

79
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:08,561
So, if you want to view this is kind of

80
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:14,330
legally giving Napoleon almost a king-like status,

81
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,060
in terms of him being...you know..

82
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,757
it writes it in words that

83
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:22,260
he will rule France for the rest of his life.

84
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,066
Then we get to 1803.

85
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,263
And actually, before I get to 1803,

86
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:26,927
remember what's happening at the same time here.

87
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:31,793
You had your Revolution in Haiti,

88
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:37,927
Revolution in Haiti

89
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,995
which, if you remember from those videos,

90
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,229
Haiti was

91
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:44,811
the most profitable slave colony in the world.

92
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:48,062
Once the slaves revolted, got their freedom,

93
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:52,260
all of a sudden not as profitable to France

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,396
as it was before.

95
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,290
And remember, the whole French Revolution started off

96
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,462
because France was broke.

97
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,663
So Napoleon tries to reinstate slavery.

98
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,813
That essentially backfires on him.

99
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,336
Dessalines catches wind of it,

100
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,979
him and the other revolutionaries, so they essentially

101
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,233
start antagonizing Leclerc even more.

102
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:16,060
Leclerc and the French occupiers

103
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,335
get ravaged by yellow fever.

104
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:20,942
And Dessalines is a very aggressive general.

105
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,665
So he starts losing Haiti.

106
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:24,194
You have Rochambeau,

107
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:26,225
if you remember from those videos, he's a, you know

108
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,534
this hugely brutal figure who takes over after Leclerc.

109
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:30,954
But we have this revolution in Haiti.

110
00:05:30,954 --> 00:05:31,953
And you can kind of say

111
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:35,004
they're starting to lose Haiti.

112
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:38,010
Lose Haiti

113
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,409
And at the same time, and this is 1802,

114
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,366
and as we're entering into 1803,

115
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:48,011
Napoleon began to realize that

116
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:52,264
Great Britain controls the seas.

117
00:05:52,264 --> 00:06:02,684
Great Britain - Dominant Navy.

118
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:04,233
And because they're losing Haiti,

119
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,182
which is really their main profit center,

120
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,367
and Great Britain is dominant,

121
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:12,100
Napoleon essentially gives up on North America.

122
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:23,302
Napoleon...so Napoleon gives up North America.

123
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,365
So outside of Haiti, which was

124
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,896
this major profit center for the French Empire,

125
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:30,260
they also had the territory of Louisiana,

126
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,698
which is essentially the middle 1/3 of

127
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,517
what we now consider to be the United States.

128
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:37,313
And Napoleon figures out, gee, you know

129
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,176
Great Britain has a dominant navy.

130
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:41,274
I'm giving up on Haiti,

131
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:44,598
I'm probably going to lose it anyway to Dessalines.

132
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,768
Let me just give up on the entire continent.

133
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:50,513
If I don't sell Louisiana, either Great Britain or

134
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:54,164
the United States will probably be in a good position

135
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,891
to take it from me.

136
00:06:55,891 --> 00:07:06,452
So he decides to sell...he sells Louisiana.

137
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,897
So just as someone, or as an American,

138
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:12,164
and especially an American who was born in Louisiana,

139
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:13,366
it's fascinating

140
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,564
the chain of events that led up to this.

141
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,544
Because when you learn it

142
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,635
from an American history point of view,

143
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:18,964
you just say hey Thomas Jefferson,

144
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:21,300
he was able to get Louisiana for $15 million.

145
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,117
Why would someone sell, all of a sudden,

146
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,454
this huge amount of territory?

147
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:28,299
And the reason is because Napoleon figured

148
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:29,944
he was going to lose it no matter what.

149
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:31,964
Great Britain had this dominant navy.

150
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,300
And at the same time,

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,718
he had nothing else to protect in the area.

152
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:39,033
The other major valuable asset there was Haiti.

153
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:42,448
So a combination of Great Britain having this navy and

154
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:46,119
of the slave revolt in Haiti ends up with

155
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,304
the United States being able to acquire

156
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:52,355
what's now the middle 1/3 of the continent.

157
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,589
You can kind of wonder, gee, if they never did that,

158
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,432
would they have ever, er, gone on to

159
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:59,479
capture the entire west coast?

160
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,823
So these small little things in history.

161
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:03,898
And I wouldn't necessarily call these little things,

162
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,308
but they lead to

163
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:09,106
very tremendous changes in our modern world.

164
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,058
But anyway, enough about that.

165
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:12,311
So he sells Louisiana.

166
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:14,452
Great Britain has a dominant navy.

167
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,206
At first,

168
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:19,976
Napoleon was thinking he was amassing troops up here,

169
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,736
he was thinking about an invasion of Great Britain.

170
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,476
But more and more it dawns on him that

171
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:25,766
Great Britain has a dominant navy.

172
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,309
Great Britain, I think,

173
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:28,911
starts to feel a little self-confident.

174
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:31,388
And they don't like all of the gains that

175
00:08:31,388 --> 00:08:34,168
Napoleon has gotten in the last two wars.

176
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:38,898
So, Great Britain declares war in 1803,

177
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:45,005
in 1803, in May 1803 -

178
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,544
Great Britain.. or I could say

179
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:48,310
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,

180
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,306
the same thing.

181
00:08:50,306 --> 00:08:54,307
U.K. declares war.

182
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,634
And you could view this

183
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,166
as the beginning of the war of the Third Coalition.

184
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,385
But it's not a coalition yet.

185
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,636
It's just the United Kingdom. Or it's just Great Britain.

186
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:06,101
And it really gets heated in 1805.

187
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:10,286
In 1805, everyone else jumps in.

188
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:12,977
And now we're talking about a real coalition.

189
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:26,421
Now Great Britain is joined by Austria and Russia.

190
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:27,517
And you know Austria, all the time

191
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:28,831
in every one of these coalitions,

192
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,624
they lose territory to France and especially Napoleon.

193
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:33,956
They just want to get revenge.

194
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:35,712
United Kingdom kind of senses that

195
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:37,757
they control the water, they want to get revenge.

196
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,355
Russia doesn't like this upstart Napoleon.

197
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:42,782
And so they all jump in.

198
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,991
And so there's two interesting angles

199
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:47,748
of the War of the Third Coalition.

200
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,946
Let me write this right here.

201
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:52,503
This is the Third Coalition.

202
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,541
And there were other people who jumped in,

203
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,825
but these were the major powers.

204
00:09:55,825 --> 00:10:02,170
So this right here is the Third Coalition.

205
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,910
So the first thing that happens,

206
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,439
or really the two almost happen simultaneously.

207
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:16,435
In October of 1805, the French navy gets destroyed

208
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,441
by the British in the Battle of Trafalgar.

209
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,638
This is Trafalgar, it's actually written here.

210
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,729
Trafalgar

211
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:27,386
And they get destroyed by Napoleon's good old friend,

212
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:31,638
Admiral Horatio Nelson.

213
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:34,617
So this guy was definitely a thorn in Napoleon's side.

214
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:37,663
Horatio Nelson

215
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:43,450
He destroyed Napoleon's ships in the Battle of the Nile

216
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,870
that stranded their troops in Egypt.

217
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,860
And now he comes and essentially destroys the

218
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,182
French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar.

219
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:54,570
And this is an image of it.

220
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,455
And I guess the only redeeming fact

221
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,867
of this battle for Napoleon was that

222
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,258
near the end of the battle,

223
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:06,566
Horatio Nelson actually gets stricken by a bullet

224
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:14,361
and he dies at Trafalgar.

225
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:17,242
So this really establishes.. you know the Royal Navy,

226
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,901
the British navy was already dominant,

227
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,041
destroying the French navy,

228
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,263
which was the only navy that

229
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,103
could in some way compete on any level.

230
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,974
Destroying them at Trafalgar really

231
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:31,016
established British domination of the seas.

232
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:34,119
This is actually an image of the Battle of Trafalgar.

233
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:36,932
This is the battle right there.

234
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:38,575
A bunch of ships just shooting at each other,

235
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:39,849
you can't really make out what's happening.

236
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:45,375
And just to connect that to modern day Great Britain,

237
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,034
or the modern day London,

238
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,171
this right here is an image of Trafalgar Square.

239
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,582
It is named after the Battle of Trafalgar,

240
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:54,614
which established Britain is dominant in the seas.

241
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:57,645
That is Trafalgar Square in London.

242
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,781
Trafalgar Square

243
00:12:00,781 --> 00:12:03,778
And if you go there, you will see Nelson's column.

244
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:06,891
This is Nelson's column right there,

245
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,555
named after Horatio Nelson. Nelson's column.

246
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:13,169
And at the very top of it, there's a little figure,

247
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,128
or it's probably pretty large,

248
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,729
but little relative to the column,

249
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,698
of Horatio Nelson himself.

250
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,461
So that was a bit of an aside,

251
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:23,771
but this occurred during the war of the Third Coalition.

252
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:26,986
So Napoleon's navy is destroyed.

253
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:27,937
But he doesn't give up.

254
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:29,134
He's just like, OK, oh well,

255
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:30,824
I can't do much beyond you,

256
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:33,629
but in Europe I can still do a lot of damage.

257
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,538
So what he does is he takes his troops that..

258
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:40,268
He had given up on actually attacking Britain by sea.

259
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,048
He realized that he could never realistically do that.

260
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,635
Let me show you the troop movements that

261
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:46,716
were going on at this time.

262
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,512
So he had troops here that

263
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:51,304
he had given up on actually attacking Great Britain.

264
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,890
And what he does is he meets the Austrians.

265
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,553
So the Austrians are amassing their troops here.

266
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,751
They actually thought that there was a possibility that

267
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,084
the main campaign would go in Italy.

268
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,640
So they actually focused most of their troops there,

269
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,639
that we'll see as a major mistake.

270
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,433
But they have troops in what we can kind of view as

271
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:11,556
southern...what is now southern Germany

272
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,088
near the Black Forest.

273
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:16,057
And then they also amassed some troops near Italy.

274
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:18,305
And then the Russians were coming up behind.

275
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,497
They weren't able to meet.

276
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,353
And we're dealing with the fall,

277
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:24,837
this is now September, October of 1805.

278
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,350
And the Russians were back here

279
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,707
trying to bring their troops

280
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,175
to assist the Austrians in meeting Napoleon.

281
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:34,692
And what Napoleon does, you know, all of these,

282
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,579
it's always unclear on how much of it was

283
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,652
tactical genius versus pure luck.

284
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,057
Because they didn't have satellites,

285
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:43,311
they didn't know where the other troops were.

286
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:45,155
They didn't necessarily know exactly what's happening

287
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:48,358
on a minute-by-minute basis, like armies do today.

288
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:52,095
But what happened, it's...er.. I guess...tremendous..

289
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:55,695
it's one of the pivotal battles in European history,

290
00:13:55,695 --> 00:14:00,287
is that Napoleon meets the Austrians at Ulm.

291
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:03,972
Let me draw it on this map right here. At Ulm.

292
00:14:03,972 --> 00:14:06,279
So on this map they just do a very general--

293
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,435
This is Napoleon meeting the Austrians

294
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,812
right here at Ulm.

295
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,248
There's actually a whole campaign of Uim,

296
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,299
several battles.

297
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,413
But it was a decisive victory at Ulm.

298
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,975
And the crux of that victory was that

299
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:23,596
Napoleon was able to fool the Austrians.

300
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,339
So this is a zoomed-in version

301
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,731
of what was going on here.

302
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,749
This is France.

303
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:33,588
This is the Black Forest. This is Austria right there.

304
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:37,813
Blue is Napoleon troops, red are the Austrian troops.

305
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:40,908
And you saw, Austria had amassed most of their troops

306
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:42,179
on the Italian front.

307
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,350
So here in Black Forest, you have your Austrian troops.

308
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,236
What Napoleon did is he had General Marat

309
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:53,115
make it look like the main force of the French

310
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:56,148
were coming straight from the West.

311
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:57,844
And they did that by having cavalry

312
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:01,513
essentially giving the appearance of a major force

313
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,290
coming in from here. So they came..

314
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,731
So the Austrians were thinking, OK, this is the direction

315
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:11,981
that we're going to face our main antagonism from.

316
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,725
But at the same time, the bulk of the Napoleon's army--

317
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,481
remember he doesn't see exactly

318
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:17,359
how many people are here,

319
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,731
they just made it look like this is the bulk of the army.

320
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:22,582
But the bulk of the army actually did

321
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,892
what they call a wheeling manoeuvre,

322
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:29,653
where they went around the Austrian army.

323
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:31,698
And they were able to do it much faster

324
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,481
and in a much more nimble way than

325
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,428
anyone would have predicted,

326
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,457
because they essentially didn't have to

327
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:38,691
carry as many supplies.

328
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,933
They were doing this during the harvest season.

329
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,282
And this was by design.

330
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,481
If you capture enemy territory

331
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,816
during the harvest season, and these are things that

332
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,914
you usually don't think about

333
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,640
when you learn about military battles.

334
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,511
But you've got troops, you've got to feed the troops.

335
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:57,486
If they can't capture food from the land,

336
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,815
then you've got to carry supplies with you.

337
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:02,082
And supplies are heavy it slows down your army.

338
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:04,500
But if you do the attack during the harvest season,

339
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,101
you don't have to carry food.

340
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:12,034
You don't carry as much food.

341
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:14,769
You can just take it from the farmers that you pass by.

342
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:16,595
They're harvesting food as you pass by,

343
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,318
you just take it, you can be fast and nimble.

344
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,922
And he essentially went around the army

345
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:24,818
and was able to attack the Austrians from this direction.

346
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,902
And then essentially destroy them.

347
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,766
And this is why I hinted in the last video that

348
00:16:29,766 --> 00:16:32,502
Napoleon starts to view himself as invincible.

349
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:35,479
And this was before the Russians could come

350
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,318
to actually reinforce the Austrians.

351
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:40,782
So they did it-- by being able to do it so quickly,

352
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,840
they were able to just only tackle the Austrians.

353
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,689
So it was a decisive victory at Ulm.

354
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:50,423
Let me go to the painting right there.

355
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,955
This is a painting of the surrender at Ulm.

356
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:57,264
The surrender at Ulm

357
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:00,455
And then the combined Russian and Austrian forces,

358
00:17:00,455 --> 00:17:04,759
they essentially, you can kind of view they regrouped,

359
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:09,727
but they re-met Napoleon's forces after Ulm.

360
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:14,789
In another several weeks, at Austerlitz.

361
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,350
And once again, Napoleon just routed them.

362
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,486
And there's always a debate.

363
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:21,755
Some of it might have been tactical genius,

364
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,750
some of it might have been pure luck.

365
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,909
But after routing them at Austerlitz--

366
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,218
so this is Austerlitz --

367
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:36,693
and taking so much I guess both in terms of

368
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:40,907
casualties and prisoners from the enemy

369
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:42,745
without incurring so much themselves,

370
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:45,739
this really was the high point in terms of

371
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,363
a battle for Napoleon. This was a high point.

372
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:51,614
Austerlitz is what really convinced Napoleon that

373
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,823
he is truly, truly a military genius.

374
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,957
And that's not saying that he's not.

375
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:58,495
But it was such a route that he started to imagine that

376
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,758
he's on some level invincible.

377
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,305
And so the outcome, this essentially ends

378
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,925
the war of the Third Coalition.

379
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:11,646
Ends 3rd Coalition

380
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:12,862
And with that ending,

381
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:16,584
Austria had to give its territory that

382
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:17,685
it had gotten in Italy.

383
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:23,821
So Austria had to cede the territory that it had in Italy,

384
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:27,253
some of the territory that it had in Bavaria.

385
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,056
And from, I guess just a general point of view,

386
00:18:30,056 --> 00:18:31,389
this was historically significant.

387
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:33,190
Because until this point in time,

388
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,485
this whole area was called the Holy Roman Empire,

389
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:39,364
with the King of Austria calling himself

390
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,248
the Holy Roman Emperor.

391
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:42,758
Even though he didn't have direct control

392
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:48,219
over all of these Germanic regions. After..this is...

393
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,389
Let me go back up here.

394
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,370
This is in 1805,

395
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,906
or we can even say we're entering 1806,

396
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:58,454
but in late 1805, with the end of the Third Coalition,

397
00:18:58,454 --> 00:19:01,359
now the Austrian King no longer

398
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,816
calls himself the Holy Roman Emperor.

399
00:19:02,816 --> 00:19:04,085
He gives up the title.

400
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:11,167
And this region right here is no longer called

401
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,829
the Holy Roman Empire.

402
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,979
It is called the Confederation of the Rhine.

403
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:23,580
Confederation of the Rhine

404
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,259
And it's essentially under the protection of Napoleon.

405
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:28,339
And this is the first time--

406
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,229
we're starting to get to a point,

407
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:34,902
Germany won't be unified for another 60 or 70 years.

408
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:36,019
But we're starting to get to the point that

409
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,753
the German nation is escaping from

410
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:40,616
the bounds of being the Holy Roman Empire.

411
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,882
And so it's getting in that direction.

412
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,872
So the Holy Roman Empire is gone.

413
00:19:46,872 --> 00:19:51,509
France gets significant territory

414
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:53,885
from Austria, once again.

415
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:57,018
Russia on some level is just humbled a little bit.

416
00:19:57,018 --> 00:20:00,682
And then we end in 1806, or at the end of 1805,

417
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:04,860
with France Dominant.

418
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,954
And while all of that was happening,

419
00:20:06,954 --> 00:20:08,015
it was really in 1804

420
00:20:08,015 --> 00:20:09,755
when France was only at war with Great Britain.

421
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:11,690
The whole alliance hadn't formed yet.

422
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,082
It 1804, in December--

423
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:18,219
and this is relevant that it's a peek into his ego.

424
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:22,778
So this is the year before Austerlitz.

425
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:27,350
In 1804, Napoleon declares himself,

426
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,766
or he crowns himself Emperor.

427
00:20:29,766 --> 00:20:39,395
Napoleon crowns himself Emperor.

428
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:41,623
And this is a picture of him as Emperor.

429
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,201
And after this point, instead of being called

430
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:49,558
Napoleon Bonaparte, he is called Napoleon I.

431
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,594
And the idea of crowning yourself Emperor,

432
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:52,682
you might say, what's the point?

433
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:54,078
You already were Consul for life,

434
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,176
you have power for your whole life.

435
00:20:55,176 --> 00:20:58,793
But other than you get this neat title emperor,

436
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,937
which probably feeds your ego quite well,

437
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:04,926
but beyond that, this essentially establishes a dynasty.

438
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,633
It now says, I'm not just a First Consul,

439
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,569
I am the emperor.

440
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,589
I'm Napoleon I.

441
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,741
And it implies that his descendants will continue to

442
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,573
reign over the French Empire.

443
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,903
So on some level, he kind of

444
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,247
destroys the notion of a republic.

445
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,377
So we're ending the Third Coalition

446
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:26,595
the Third Coalition with France dominant

447
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,364
France is dominant in Europe.

448
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:33,618
It has gotten all of this territory mainly from Austria.

449
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:37,356
The Holy Roman Empire no longer exists.

450
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,226
It's now the Confederation of the Rhine.

451
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:43,898
Napoleon, after Austerlitz, thinks that he is invincible.

452
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:47,917
And he also is now Emperor. So he has all of his,

453
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:51,917
you know, his visions of grandeur coming true.
