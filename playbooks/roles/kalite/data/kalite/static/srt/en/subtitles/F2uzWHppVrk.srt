1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, now I'm gonna talk to you about pressure, resistance, and flow.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're gonna try to make sure you feel real comfortable with all three of these things.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, we start with the heart.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And after the heart is the aorta.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's the largest artery in the body.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this is one branch of the aorta.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I didn't draw a lot the other one.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the brachial artery.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the blood is flowing

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from the aorta to the brachial artery.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And let's say that the blood

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is trying to make its way out to

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a fingertips, for example.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, on its way out there makes its way to an arteriole.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the blood continues flowing.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it goes into a capillary bed.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the vessel is the small to draw,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I just kinda do that thing.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And -then, goes into the other half of the capillary bed,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where now the blood is deoxygenated.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'm gonna draw that is blue.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the part where now the blood is without oxygen.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then it continues to go and get collected into a venule,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which sounds little bit like the arterial in the other side, right?

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We got a vein over here,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then finally the blood gets collected in a large vein called the vena cava.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there're actually tro vena cavas.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, this'll be the superior vena cava,

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this's also an inferior vena cava.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the blood flow through this half is as you guess,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of continue to go around.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if I were to try to figure out the pressures,

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the blood pressures at different points along this system,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm gonna choose some points that I think would be interesting ones to check,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it'll be good probably to check what the pressure is right at the beginning.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then maybe at all the branch points.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, what the pressure is as the blood goes from the aorta to the brachial artery.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe as it ends the brachial artery and enters the arteriole.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Maybe the beginning and the end of the capillaries.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Also from the venule to a vein,

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and also wrapping it up, what the pressure is at the end.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Obvious numbers or these pressures can be represent its number, right.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Like what is the millimeters of mercury,

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the blood is exerting on the wall

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at that particular point in the system

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And earlier we talked about

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the systolic versus diastolic pressure.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there we want you to use two numbers,

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's kind of the range,

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the upper and the lower range of a pressure.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But now, I'm gonna do with one number.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the reason why I'm using one number of two,

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that this is the average pressure over time.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the average pressure over time for me,

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
keep in mind my blood pressure is pretty normal,

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's somewhere around 120 over 80 in my arm.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the average pressure in the aorta

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
-kinda coming out- would be somewhere around 95

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in the artery in the arm probably somewhere around 90,

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
again, that's what you'd expect, somewhere between 80-120.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 90 is the average, because it's gonna be not exactly 100.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because remember, it's spending more time in diastole,

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in relaxation, than in systole.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, it's gonna be close to that 80, for that reason,

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then if you check the pressure over here, by this X,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
probably something like --let's say 80,

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then as you cross the arteriole,

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the pressure falls dramatically,

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's somewhere closer to 30.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then here it's about 20,

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here's about 15,

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say 10 over here.

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, at the very end it's gonna be close to a 5 or so.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, here I'm just write that in 10, and 5.

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the units here are millimiters of mercury,

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so I just write that pressure [P] in millimeter of mercury [mmHg].
