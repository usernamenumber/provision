1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,320
Let's do some problems with
plotting points and graphical

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,110
representations of functions.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,070
So I didn't write the problem
here, but what they ask us to

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,590
do here is figure out
the coordinates of

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,800
each of these points.

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,200
So let's just do that.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,350
So first we have this
point a right there.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,240
So I'll just write a is
at the coordinate.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,090
So we write the x-coordinate
first. So its x-coordinate is

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,780
how far to the left or the right
it is of the origin.

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,830
And it is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to
the left, or it is negative 6

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,230
of the origin, or it's at the
coordinate negative 6.

14
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,420
So negative 6, that's
right there.

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,950
And then its y-coordinate, which
is how high it is, that

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,330
is right there.

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,850
That's 4.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,790
Negative 6, 4.

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,060
Let's do b right there.

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,890
b is at the coordinate-- let's
see, its x-coordinate, and

21
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,580
just drop down there, is 7.

22
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,950
And its y-coordinate, how
high it is, is 6.

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,730
All right.

24
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,980
Let's do c.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,830
   

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,410
The x-coordinate, and you can
read that, it's negative 8.

27
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,110
It's 8 to the left
of the origin.

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,550
Negative 8.

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,000
And its y-coordinate, it's
2 below the origin.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,120
So its y-coordinate right
there is negative 2.

31
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,200
This is, I think,
not too painful.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,590
Part d, or coordinate
d, or point d.

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,880
Point d, its y-coordinate,
it's at 4.

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,990
And then its-- I'm sorry, its
x-coordinate is at 4, and then

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,860
its y-coordinate, how far down
it is, or in this vertical

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,730
axis, it is-- this looks
like negative 7.

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,450
   

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,025
And then, finally,
we are on e.

39
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm picking out a nice
color for e.

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,420
e right there.

41
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,460
Its x-coordinate is 5.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,340
It's right on the x-axis
at x is equal to 5.

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,350
And its y-coordinate-- well,
it isn't above or below the

44
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,960
origin or the x-axis, so
its y-coordinate is 0.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,930
You could draw a line and
go straight there to 0.

46
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,120
So there we go.

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,940
We figured out all of
those coordinates.

48
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,220
Now this problem 5 here-- let me
scroll over a little bit--

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,150
they say determine whether each
relation is a function.

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,990
So here the trick is to realize
that a relation is not

51
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,040
a function if they define two
values for a given x.

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,660
Let me give an example here.

53
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:51,680
So if I wrote that f of x is
equal to 5 if x is equal to 1,

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,820
or it's equal to 6 if
x is equal to 1.

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,070
This makes no sense.

56
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,310
   

57
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,710
Why doesn't it make any sense?

58
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,810
Because if I put a 1 in there,
I don't know what

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,510
I'm going to produce?

60
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,000
Am I going to produce a 5?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,460
Am I going to produce a 6?

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,230
This is a badly structured
function.

63
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,720
This is not a function.

64
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,360
So if there's any situation for
the same input value, they

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,880
define two different output
values, we're not going to

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,030
have a function.

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,860
So let's see if they
do that here.

68
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,120
So in this first part, part a,
they say, if you could imagine

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,160
if x is 1 then y is 7.

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,010
If x is 2, y is 7 as well.

71
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,130
That is OK.

72
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,500
You could have two x values
getting the same y value.

73
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:44,020
For example, that'd be like
saying f of x is equal to 7 if

74
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,740
x is equal to 1 or 2.

75
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,540
This is completely fine.

76
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,020
For two different x values you
can get the same output value,

77
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,160
but you can't have two different
x values giving the

78
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,120
same-- sorry-- you can't have
the same x value producing two

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,060
different outputs.

80
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,870
Because then you don't know,
hey, if you went f of 1, you

81
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,100
don't know what f of 1 is.

82
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
f of 1, is it a 5, is it 6?

83
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,900
You don't know.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,780
Here you know what f
of 1 is, it's 7.

85
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,440
Here you know what f
of 2 is, it's 7.

86
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,050
So, so far so good.

87
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,850
So when you have 2,
you have a 7.

88
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,570
When your input is
3, you get an 8.

89
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,810
When your input is
4, you get an 8.

90
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,840
So, for example, our function
definition, so it's 8 if x is

91
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,550
equal to 3 or 4.

92
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,960
And then 5.

93
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,770
And then our function is equal
to 9 if x is equal to 5.

94
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,010
So part a, this is our function
definition, right

95
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,250
here, for part a, which is a
completely legitimate function

96
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,680
definition.

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,080
You give me any value 1, 2, 3,
4, or 5, which would be the

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,740
domain in this situation, and I
will tell you what the value

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,000
of that function is at
any of those points.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,230
And the range would
be 7, 8, or 9.

101
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,660
So part a is definitely
a function.

102
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,110
Now part b.

103
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,940
Let's see, if x is 1, y is 1.

104
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,140
But then they say, if x
is 1, y is negative 1.

105
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,560
Well, that makes no sense.

106
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,760
They're doing this right here.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,202
They're trying to make a
function, where they say this

108
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:16,790
function is going to be equal
to 1 if x is equal to 1, but

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,180
then it's going to be equal to
negative 1 if x is equal to 1.

110
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,370
So if I were to take f of
1, I don't know what

111
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:24,840
it's going to be.

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,700
Is it 1 or negative 1?

113
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,910
I don't know, do I take this
1 or do I take that 1?

114
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,870
So this is not a function.

115
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,850
So part b is not a function.

116
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,270
That relation is
not a function.

117
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,060
All right.

118
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,450
Let's do a couple more.

119
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,520
Problem 6.

120
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,185
Write the function rule
for each graph.

121
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,450
So we have this little
v looking thing.

122
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,910
So we could write it
a couple of ways.

123
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,425
Let's call it f of x.

124
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,120
And you could call it g of x, or
h of x, but if you haven't

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
used your f yet, people
tend to use f of x.

126
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,940
So this is x.

127
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,980
So let's see, it looks like
it's one line when x is

128
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,320
greater than the 0, and
another line when x

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
is less than 0.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,960
So it's one thing when x is,
let's say, greater than or

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,990
equal to 0.

132
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,470
And another thing when
x is less than 0.

133
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,490
And I'm going to merge
the two in a second.

134
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,520
So what does the line
look like here?

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,280
When x is 0, y is 0.

136
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,860
When x is 2, y is 1.

137
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,690
When x is 4, y is 2.

138
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,370
It looks like no matter
what x is, y is going

139
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,630
to be 1/2 of that.

140
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,630
When x is 6, y is 3.

141
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:38,440
So it's equal to 1/2x, when
x is greater than 0.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,070
And then when x is less
than 0, when x is

143
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,930
negative 2, y is 1.

144
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,620
When x is negative 4, y is 2.

145
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,750
So here it looks like it's
the negative 1/2 of it.

146
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,600
Negative 1/2 times negative
4 is positive 2.

147
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,790
So it's negative 1/2 times
x, when x is less than 0.

148
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,870
So this is a completely
legitimate answer.

149
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,660
But if we wanted to make it a
little bit simpler, or clean

150
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,670
it up a little bit, we could
write this function definition

151
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,640
as f of x being equal to--
instead of dividing it between

152
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,340
greater than or less than 0,
let's just take the absolute

153
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,890
value of x and then multiply
that times 1/2.

154
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,920
Because here, that obviously
works for positive values,

155
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,430
because the absolute value
of x will be equal to x.

156
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,402
But then for negative values,
the absolute value of x is

157
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,170
equal to negative x.

158
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,150
So you take negative 2 here.

159
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,910
Negative 2, take the absolute
value, you get 2

160
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,570
times 1/2 is 1.

161
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,890
So either of these would
be legitimate function

162
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,630
definitions.

163
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,870
Problem 10.

164
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,270
Use the vertical line test-- let
me switch colors for this

165
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,500
one-- use the vertical line test
to determine whether each

166
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,570
relation is a function.

167
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,530
Now, the vertical line test is
just a visual way of doing

168
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,980
exactly what we did in this
problem over here.

169
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,370
Something is only a function
if for a given x value, you

170
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,670
only have one y value.

171
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,670
So for example, when they say a
vertical line, that means at

172
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,970
any point I should be able to
draw a vertical line on this

173
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,240
function and only intersect
it once.

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,420
Because a vertical line says
when x is equal to 3, there's

175
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,400
only one value that I can
get on our function.

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,810
That's what I'm doing with
a vertical line.

177
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,510
When x is equal to 0, there's
only one point on the function

178
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,290
that is mapped from
x is equal to 0.

179
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,150
So this one right here
is a function.

180
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,950
Any vertical line you draw
will only intersect the

181
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,559
function once.

182
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,039
This one, very clearly, you
draw any vertical line.

183
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,970
You draw any vertical line
here and you're going to

184
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,700
intersect the graph twice.

185
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,110
So this is saying, this vertical
line that I just

186
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,590
drew, this is essentially saying
f of 2 could be this

187
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,400
point over here.

188
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,060
This looks like, I don't know,
maybe it's equal to, it could

189
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,810
be equal to 1.9 or it
could be-- what is

190
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,790
this?-- negative 1.9.

191
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,620
This is not a proper function
definition.

192
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,010
I don't know whether f of 2 is
this value or that value.

193
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,300
I don't know whether f of 0 is
that value or that value.

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,510
And you could keep going across
the whole number line.

195
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,950
You don't know whether f of 5
is this value or this value.

196
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,870
So this is not a function.

197
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,990
This relation is
not a function.

198
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,280
   

199
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,620
And it's the same logic as we
did before, but we're saying

200
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,290
the vertical line.

201
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,350
You could draw a vertical line
and you can intersect the

202
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,110
relation or the graph twice,
so it's not a function.
