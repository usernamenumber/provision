1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:04,600
Lets do some example problems here, so we have the perimeter

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,800
of each of the outer triangles is 30. So for example if I took

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,533
The sum of this side, this side, and that side I will get 30 and that is

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:17,000
true of all these outer triangles, these 5 outer triangles.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,133
They then tell us that the perimeter of FGHIJ

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:28,933
So FGHIJ the perimeter of this pentagon right over here is 50

7
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:34,333
So if I add up that side plus that side plus that side plus that side, plus that side,

8
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:39,000
I get 50. And then they say what is the perimeter of the star?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,600
So the perimeter of the star is really the outsides. if you take the bases

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,867
away of each of these triangles. So it is this side, let me do this in a new color actually

11
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:51,267
So the perimeter of the triangle i will do in orange. It is going to be this

12
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:57,667
plus that plus that plus that plus that plus that

13
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:02,333
i think you get the idea plus that plus that plus that plus that

14
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:10,600
So the perimeter of the of the star so let me call this: perimeter perimeter of the star

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,667
it is going to be equal to the perimeter of the 5 triangles

16
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:23,267
is equal to perimeter of 5 outer triangles. Just call them 5 triangles like this

17
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:28,133
minus their basis, right, if i take the perimeter of all of these sides

18
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:33,067
If i added up the part that should not be part of the perimeter of the star

19
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:37,000
would be this part,that part, that part,that part, that part and that part.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,333
those are not the part, those are not the part of the perimeter of the star

21
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,733
so should be the perimeter of the 5 triangles minus the links of their bases

22
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:52,067
links of their 5 bases. So what is the perimeter of the 5 triangles?

23
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:57,800
well, the perimeter of each of them is 30, perimeter of 5 of them is going to be 5 times 30

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,800
which is 150, now we want to subtract out the links of their 5 bases

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,600
now the links of their 5 bases if we add them up is the exact perimeter of this in inner pentagon

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,667
right over here. So this inner pentagon has a perimeter 50, that is the sum of the 5 bases.

27
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:22,733
So that right over here is 50, so the perimeter of the star is going to be 150 minus 50, or or 100.

28
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:26,133
All we need is to get the perimeter of all triangles, subtracted out these bases

29
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,790
which was the perimeter of the inner pentagon and we are done.

30
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,395
Now lets do the next problem.

31
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,533
What is the area of this this quadrilateral, something that has 4 sides of ABCD?

32
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:45,692
And this is a little bit we have not seen a figure quite like this just yet,

33
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,467
it on the right hand side looks like a rectangle, and on the left hand side looks like a triangle

34
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:53,000
and this is actually trapezoid, but we can actually as you could imagine

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
the way we figure out the area of several triangles splitting it up into pieces we can recognise.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
And the most obvious thing to do here is started A and just drop a rock

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,000
drop an altitude right over here, and so this line right over here is going to hit

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,333
at 90 degrees and we could call this point E.

39
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:13,333
And what is interesting here is we can split this up into something we recognize

40
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:21,000
a rectangle and a right triangle. But you might say how do, how do we figure out what these you know

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,800
we have this side and that side, so we can figure out the area

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,867
of this rectangle pretty straight forwardly. But how would we, how would we figure out the area of this

43
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:35,000
triangle? Well if this side is 6 then that means that this that EC is also going to be 6.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,933
If AB is 6, notice we have a rectangle right over her, opposite side of a rectangle are equal.

45
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:49,800
So if AB equals 6, implies that EC is equal to 6, EC is equal to 6, so EC is equal to 6

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:58,267
and if EC is equal to 6 then that tells us that DE is going to be 3.

47
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,733
DE is going to be 3, this distance right over here is going to be 3.

48
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:07,000
And we know that because if this is 6, this has to be something that we add to 6 to get 9,

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,667
9 was the length of this entire, of the entire base of this figure right over here.

50
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:18,067
9 was this entire distance so 9 minus 6 gives us 3, and now we have all the information that we need

51
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:22,933
to figure out the area. The area of this part right over here of this rectangle is

52
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:30,667
just going to be 6 times 7, so is going to be equal to 42 plus the area of this triangle right over here.

53
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:37,000
Plus the area of this triangle right over here, and that is one half base times height one half.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,933
The base over her is 3, one half times 3 and the height over here is once again going to be 7

55
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:48,400
this is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so if this is 7, this is also going to be 7

56
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,267
one half times 3 times 7, so it is going be 42, lets see.

57
00:04:52,267 --> 00:05:04,600
3 times 7 is 21, 21 divided by 2 is 10.5, 10.5 so this is going to be equal to 52.5

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,267
52.5 is the area of this entire figure.

59
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,533
Lets do one more.

60
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:16,533
So here I have a bizarre looking, a bizarre looking shape, and we need to figure out its perimeter.

61
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:21,333
And it it first seems very daunting because they have only given us this side and this side

62
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,267
and they have only given us this side right over here.

63
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:29,333
And one thing that we are allowed to assume in this and you don't always have to make

64
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,467
you can't always make that assumption and I just didn't draw it here

65
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,667
I had time because it would had really crowded out this this diagram.

66
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:39,400
Is it all of the angles in this diagrams are right angles,so i could have drawn a right angle here

67
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,867
a right angle here, a right angle there, right angle there, but as you can see

68
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,733
it kind of makes things a little bit, it makes things a little bit messy.

69
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:49,067
But how do we figure out the perimeter if we don't know these little distances,

70
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:54,600
if we don't know these little distances here. And the secret here is to kind of shift the sides

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,867
because all we want to care about is the sum of the sides of the sides.

72
00:05:56,867 --> 00:06:02,200
So what I will do is a little exercise in shifting the sides. So this side over here I am going to shift

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:08,200
it and put it right up there, then this side right over here, this length right over here

74
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,000
I am going to shift and put it right over there. Then let me keep using different colors, and then this

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,933
side right over here I am going to shift it and put it right up here. Then finally Iam going to have

76
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:24,267
this side right over here, I can shift it and put it right over there and I think you see

77
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:28,533
what is going on right now. Now all of these sides combined are going to be the same as this side

78
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:34,733
kind of building, even you know this thing was not a rectangle,its its perimeter is going to be a little bit interesting.

79
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:40,000
All we have to think about is this 2 right over here, now lets think about all of these sides that is

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,800
going up and down. So this side i can shift it all the way to the right and go right over here.

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,867
Let me make it clear all inside goes all the way to the end, right that it is the exact same all insde.

82
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:56,200
Now this white side I can shift all the way to the right over there, then this green side I can shift

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,333
right over there and then I have, and then I can shift, and then i can shift this.

84
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,333
Actually let me not shift that green side yet, let me just leave that green side

85
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,200
so I have not, I have not done anything yet, let me be clear I have not done anything yet with that and

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,533
that I have not shift them over and let me take this side right over here and shift it over.

87
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:21,333
So let me take this entire thing and shift over there and shift it over there.

88
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:27,733
So before I count these two pieces right over here and we know that each have length 2

89
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,333
this 90 degrees angle, so this has link to and this has link to.

90
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:35,333
Before I count these two pieces, I shifted everything else so I was able to form a rectangle.

91
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:40,667
So at least counting everything else I have 7 plus 6, so lets see 7 plus 6

92
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:50,267
all of these combined are also going to be 7, plus 7, and all of these characters combined are all also going to be 6,

93
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:56,200
plus 6, and then finally I have this 2, right here that I have not counted before, this 2,

94
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,933
plus this 2, plus this 2. And then we have our perimeter, so what is this giving us,

95
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:11,267
7 plus 6 is 13, plus 7 is 20, plus 6 is 26, plus 4 more is equal to 30.

96
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,067
And we are done.
