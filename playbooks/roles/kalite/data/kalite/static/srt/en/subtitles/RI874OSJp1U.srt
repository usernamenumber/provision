1
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:09,125
So far we've been dealing with one way of Probability, that was the probability of (A) occur,

2
00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:20,735
The number of events that satisfy A over all number of the equally likely events

3
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:31,324
All of the equally likely events.

4
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:38,429
And so in the case of a coin, The Probability of heads was a fair coin

5
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,119
With 2 equally likely events, satisfies being "Heads"

6
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,720
So there's a half chance of having a "Heads"

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,807
Similarly for tails, if you took a die

8
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:53,476
The probability of getting an even number.

9
00:00:53,476 --> 00:01:00,070
Well there's 6 equally likely events, and there are three even numbers you can get

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,133
Which are, two, four and six

11
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:08,243
So there's three over six, or simply,

12
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:09,133
One half chance

13
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:13,305
And this is a really good model

14
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,767
of equally likely events. Now I'm going to change things up a little

15
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:19,110
I'll draw a line, this was just one way about thinking of probability

16
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,544
Now we're going to talk of probability where we can think of equally likely events

17
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:28,631
And in particular I'm going to set up an unfair coin

18
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:32,133
So this right over here, is supposed to be my unfair coin.

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:53,197
One side of that coin is heavier than the other, So this is the head's side

20
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,933
And obviously on the back, is Tails

21
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,533
As I said, this is an UNFAIR coin

22
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:02,067
Now I'm going to make an interesting statement about this unfair coin

23
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,133
It doesn't fit into the model I've created above,

24
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:10,800
And this interesting statement is, above we had a 50-50 chance of getting heads

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,297
I'm going to say, here, that the probability of getting Heads, for this coin right here,

26
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,293
is 60% (Sixty Per Cent)

27
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,640
Or another way to say,

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,333
0.6 or 6 upon 10.

29
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:31,510
Or another way to say this is 3/5 or three-fifths

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:40,984
Now we can't say there are two equally likely events

31
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,585
There are two possible events

32
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,513
The coin may fall on the heads, or tails

33
00:02:44,513 --> 00:02:46,835
So it is obvious that either we'll get Heads or Tails

34
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,111
But there aren't really two equally likely events

35
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:58,770
Counting the number of events that satisfy, over all the possible events

36
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,229
In this situation, we can visualize the probability.

37
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,061
This is fundamentally different from the model we talked about above.

38
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,133
We have to kind of take, a frequentive approach

39
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,667
Think about it in terms of frequency,

40
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:12,935
And the way to conceptualize, 60% chance of getting heads

41
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:21,108
If we had a super large number of trials. This means if we are to flip this coin

42
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,105
Like a zillion times

43
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:27,563
We would expect, 60% of those would come up as heads

44
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:33,740
So I'm clear how I determine, that this is60%! Maybe I ran a computer stimulation, maybe I should know exactly all about physics

45
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,408
Of this, and I can completely marvel how it's going to fall everytime

46
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:44,978
Or maybe it's like, I have a tonne of trials, I flip the coin a million times And I said, well, 60%

47
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:49,297
Of those, therefore, came up heads.

48
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,851
And we can make a similar statement about Tails!

49
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,267
So, the probability of Heads is 60%

50
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,446
The Probability of Tails, well there're only two possibilities, whether there can be heads or tails!

51
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:04,204
So if I say the probability of heads or tails, is going to be equal to 1 !

52
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:08,384
Because there also can be a chance of getting hundred percent Heads or tails

53
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,471
And these are mutually exclusive events, you can't have both of them

54
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:21,387
So this is going to be, the probability of tails is, going to be 100% - Probability of Heads

55
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,731
which of course is 60% (as above)

56
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,399
Which is equal to 40%

57
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,396
or as a decimal, it is 0.4

58
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:35,467
Or as a fraction, four tenths, or Four upon Ten, or in its simplest form, it is Two Fifths, 2 over 5

59
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:43,492
So once again, we can't call them equally likely events. If we toss a coin a zillion times, and we get

60
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:49,576
60% of the coins as heads, it is obvious that the rest coins have to be tails

61
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:53,152
It's time for some problems now,

62
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:58,446
The probability of getting heads on our first flip and heads on our second flip.

63
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:04,205
So once again these are independent flips. The coin has no memory, regardless what I got on the first

64
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:09,200
flip, I have equal chance of getting heads on the second flip. I can get heads and tails on the first

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,861
as well, so the probability of heads on the first flip X Probability of getting heads on the second flip.

66
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:21,202
Now we already know that the probability of getting heads on the first flip is 60%

67
00:05:21,202 --> 00:05:29,700
Or let's write it in the decimal form, it is 0.6

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:06:08,933
Also, P(H2) is 0.6. And we can just multiply. I'll do it right here, so this is 0.6 x 0.6

69
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:13,168
It is equal to 0.36.

70
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:28,867
We're taking 60% of 0.6. 0.36, or another way to say it that we have 36% of getting two heads in a row

71
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,509
Given this unfair coin, remember if it was a fair coin, one half times which is one over four which

72
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,877
1/4 or 25%.

73
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:40,057
Now let's see a slightly complicated example;

74
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:51,295
Let's say, the Probability of getting a tails on the first flip, getting a heads on the second flip,

75
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:56,775
And getting a tails on the third flip. So this is going to be equal to the probability of getting a tails on the first and third flip, and a heads on the second

76
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:07,874
It is equal to The Probability of Getting Tails on the First flip, multiplied by the probability of getting

77
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:24,778
heads on the second flip, heads being on the second time doesn't affect the probability of heads and similarly, a tails, again, on the third flip

78
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,308
And we know that the probability of getting a tails is 0.4

79
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:34,391
The Probability of getting a heads(on any flip) is 0.6 and the probability of getting tails on the third flip is 0.4

80
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:43,000
So once again we just have to multiply all these probabilities,

81
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:58,447
So 0.4 X 0.4 X 0.6 = 0.096

82
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:36,992
Or another way it to write is 9.6%, a little less than 10%. We have a 9.6% chance of getting this probability

83
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:39,933
Remember, in this case, the position of heads or tails, first, second or third does not affect

84
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:54,500
Their probability

85
00:08:54,500 --> 99:59:59,999
Thanks!
