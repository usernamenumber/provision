1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:02,439
Many people have portraits of their husband

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:15,167
That's true, and this was found in the villa of Livia, who was Augustus' wive

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,530
It was found in her villa at Primaporta

4
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,866
Most people now have just a photograph of their husband in their home,

5
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:22,702
not a full-scal marble sculpture! 
--Not usually

6
00:00:22,702 --> 00:00:27,888
But that was exactly what Livia had

7
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:29,431
Except that, allthough this was found in her home,

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:29,931
these sculptures had enormous political significance:

9
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:30,431
they were filled with Roman political ideology, as with so much Roman art.

10
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:31,457
Well, this was probably a copy of a bronze, which would have been used

11
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:31,957
In a much more public environment.
--And many more copies were made

12
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:32,457
This is just one that happened to survive.

13
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,283
It was important for the emperor to distribute his image throughout the empire

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:33,783
and so many copies were made of images of the emperor

15
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,283
This is long before photography of course and most people would never get to see the emperor -

16
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:34,783
So he distributed the likeness, and in a sense, the attributes of the ruler through sculpture and painting

17
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:35,828
'Likeness' is a good word, because it is 'like' Augustus, but not exactly Augustus

18
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:36,328
because, surely, this is idealised:

19
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:36,828
He is made to look younger, handsomer, more athletic,

20
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,328
but you can still identify his features across many different sculptures

21
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:37,828
Augustus is a complicated figure. He says that he is re-establishing the Senate

22
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:38,328
but he does that as a strategy to in fact consolidate power, to become Rome's first true emperor

23
00:00:38,328 --> 00:00:38,828
That's right, and he does that at quite a young age, whereas the rulers of the ancient Republic

24
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:39,981
were old, experienced men. There was an age requirement for holding office during the Republic.

25
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:40,481
In this new era, ushered in by Augustus, of the Empire, he wants to communicate a very different image

26
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:40,981
one where he is more godlike: he is more youthful, more transcendent

27
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:41,481
So we have the new ruler of the Empire, who is using this sculpture

28
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:42,914
as a way of communicating how he wants to be understood,

29
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:43,414
what he wants to represent to his public, to those that he rules.

30
00:00:43,414 --> 00:00:43,914
The identity that he wants to portrait and communicate is god-like and recalling the ancient Greek

31
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:45,955
the golden age of Pericles, of 5th century BC Athens

32
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:47,090
So how does he do that? For one thing, the proportions of his body follow the Canon

33
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,025
that is, a sculpture that we now call the Doryphoros by Polykleitos from ancient Greece

34
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:48,730
a sculpture that showed the beauty of the body

35
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,028
so he takes on a Greek ideal. In a way he is saying "I am going to create a golden age,

36
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:53,622
just like the golden age of 5th century BC Greece"

37
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:54,647
"so I am going to show myself as the famous sculpture from that age"

38
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,147
Then he shows us that he has what it takes to do that:

39
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:55,868
For one thing, down at his ankle, pulling at his hem, is Cupid

40
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:56,368
Cupid was the son of the goddess Venus. Augustus traced his ancestry back to Aeneas,

41
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:56,868
the founder of Rome, and son of Venus.
So by putting Cupid down there,

42
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:58,617
we are meant to remember that Augustus is decendant from a Goddess

43
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,117
He is saying that he is in fact part devine

44
00:00:59,117 --> 00:00:59,973
Also, not only did he say he was descendant from Venus,

45
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:00,534
he also said he was the son of the god Julius Caesar

46
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,050
an actual human being, who has been deified - made into a god - subsequently

47
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,550
by Augustus. So he has 'God' written all over him.

48
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,050
In fact, he literally does on his breast plate,

49
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,564
where we see the god of the sky, and the goddess of the earth

50
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:03,064
So all of the devine forces come together here for Augustus' rule.

51
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:03,564
The breast plate is probably a thick leather cuirass,

52
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,414
that is embossed with scenes that are allmost a kind of personal resume

53
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:06,914
The most important scene shows the Romans reclaiming their standards from the Parthians

54
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:07,414
Augustus had defeated this older enemy of Rome, who had taken their standards in an earlier battle

55
00:01:07,414 --> 00:01:07,914
so the fact that the Parthians are shown here returning the standards,

56
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:08,414
is a significant gesture of defeat and acknowledgement of the power of Rome

57
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:08,914
So we have a man that is of divine origin,

58
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:09,414
that is a brilliant military leader,

59
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:09,914
that is shown ennobled in the tradition of the great ancient Greeks.

60
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:10,414
This is a tremendously powerful visual propaganda.
