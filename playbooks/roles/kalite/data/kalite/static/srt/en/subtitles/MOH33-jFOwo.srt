1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:06,375
If a doctor's concerned if a patient has diabetes or is at risk for diabetes

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:10,074
they might suggest an A1C test to be performed

3
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:14,467
What I want to do in this video is to explore what A1C even means

4
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:17,828
and also how that actually relates to diabetes

5
00:00:17,828 --> 00:00:24,915
or the main side effect of diabetes, which is having high blood sugar, or "hyperglycemia"

6
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:29,559
So to do that, let's think about red blood cells

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,881
and I know what you're thinking: what is this to do with diabetes?

8
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,553
we'll get there in a little bit

9
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:36,850
So red blood cells are the main oxygen carriers in our blood

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,133
they kind of look like these lozenges

11
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,794
and inside a red blood cells

12
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:47,345
you have hundreds and millions of haemoglobin molecules, or haemoglobin proteins

13
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:50,533
So let me draw some haemoglobin proteins

14
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:56,773
Actually we have, the number I found is, 200-300 million per red blood cell

15
00:00:56,773 --> 00:01:00,442
and then we have tens of trillions of red blood cells, so we have a lot of haemoglobins in us

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:03,785
and haemoglobin is what makes red blood cells red

17
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:06,757
When haemoglobin is bound to oxygen, it has a red colour

18
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:11,854
This right here, each of those are haemoglobin proteins

19
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:18,600
Now, it turns out, a haemoglobin, let me draw a bigger version of it... haemoglobin

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,867
If it has some glucose around, so let me draw some glucose floating around near the haemoglobin

21
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:28,468
If it has some glucose around, there's some chance

22
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,697
it's not a high probability, but there's some chance

23
00:01:30,697 --> 00:01:33,855
that the haemoglobin and the glucose bump into each other

24
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:39,381
at just the right way that they'll bind to each other

25
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:45,883
And so you'll have this situation where you have glucose bound to the haemoglobin

26
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:57,400
Now this haemoglobin with the glucose bound to it, is called "glycated haemoglobin"

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:05,574
I wrote "glycated" in green, 'cause I'm using green for the glucose

28
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:12,000
Another name for glycated haemoglobin, or haemoglobin that has some glucose bound to it

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,388
is "haemoglobin A1C"

30
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:23,081
And now I can imagine things are starting to click in your brain

31
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:31,626
When you're measuring your A1C level, that's a test of the percentage of your haemoglobin that is haemoglobin A1C

32
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:36,363
So you take a blood test, they're measuring relative to the total amount of haemoglobin

33
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:43,747
what percentage of that is haemoglobin A1C

34
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:48,948
And a normal range of that, so if just have normal blood sugar for a reasonable amount of time

35
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:55,267
you're going to have a haemoglobin A1C level in kind of a 4-6% range

36
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:59,600
And people are still kind of trying to tighten up this range

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,088
and it doesn't completely correlate tightly with the blood sugar

38
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:09,933
Well, it does correlate, but still, people of the same blood sugar can still have fairly different A1C levels

39
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:15,373
But 4-6% is considered normal

40
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:18,716
And if you have higher, higher than 7 or 8%

41
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:25,001
so greater than 7 or 8%, so if you have like an A1C level of 9 or 10%, that's high

42
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:30,303
So you can imagine this is kind of a proxy for how much glucose you have in your bloodstream

43
00:03:30,303 --> 00:03:32,811
because the more glucose you have in your bloodstream

44
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:39,452
the higher the probability that that glucose is going to react with the actual haemoglobin

45
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:44,700
so you're going to have a higher percentage of haemoglobin A1C

46
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,995
And the other reason why this is useful is kind of, well I guess you can see on the first pass

47
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,991
it's useful because not one of these snapshots that test

48
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:55,102
everything we've talked about so far, with respect to diabetes

49
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,028
is taking your blood sugar at any one point in time

50
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:01,186
and we know that your blood sugar changes through out the day

51
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,043
changes depending on how active you are

52
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,830
changes depending on what you might have just eaten

53
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,337
so when you do blood sugar, you're just getting a sample

54
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:12,099
you don't know where the blood sugar is through out the day, unless you just kept sampling

55
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,093
which can get pretty annoying, you know, keep pricking your needle

56
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:22,130
With A1C, this starts to become a measure of how much glucose you've had in your blood

57
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,963
over a longer period of time

58
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:28,121
And in general kind of uses for a measure for the last few months

59
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,093
because the red blood cells and the haemoglobin in them

60
00:04:31,093 --> 00:04:37,455
they have a life span of about 120 days

61
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:43,539
That obviously doesn't mean all of your haemoglobin gets produced on one day and all dies 120 days later

62
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:47,890
you have some red blood cells and haemoglobin that might be a few seconds old

63
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,737
and then you have some that might be approaching 120 days old

64
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:54,452
so on average they're going to be around 60 days old, or about 2 months old

65
00:04:54,452 --> 00:05:00,722
So on measuring this percentage, you're definitely not getting the percentage of anything older than 120 days

66
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:04,390
and on average you're seeing things that are from about 2 months old

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,635
So the higher this percentage, this is saying:

68
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:13,800
Wow, this is, you know, my average haemoglobin molecule in my body is only maybe 60 days old at this point

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,579
And already 7-8% of them have already been glycated

70
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:23,942
which is an indicator that I probably have more blood sugar than a normal person

71
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:31,133
In normal situation, only 4-6% of my haemoglobin would get glycated

72
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:34,065
so hopefully that explains what A1C is

73
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:38,400
But I do want to say, and I said in the beginning of the video, that I'm not a doctor

74
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,632
and even amongst doctors, the A1C test, or the A1C measurement

75
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:50,691
there's some debate about how useful it is, what it's measuring

76
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:56,682
or kind of how far back it actually is a good view at kind of your glucose levels

77
00:05:56,682 --> 00:06:02,301
And also, as I've mentioned, two people with the exact same blood sugar could have different A1C levels

78
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:08,533
depending on other things: how old they are, whether they have some other type of medical condition
